Objectives: Natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning approaches
were used to build classifiers to identify genomic-related treatment changes in
the free-text visit progress notes of cancer patients.
Methods: We obtained 5889 deidentified progress reports (2439 words on average)
for 755 cancer patients who have undergone a clinical next generation sequencing 
(NGS) testing in Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center for our data
analyses. An NLP system was implemented to process the free-text data and extract
NGS-related information. Three types of recurrent neural network (RNN) namely,
gated recurrent unit, long short-term memory (LSTM), and bidirectional LSTM
(LSTM_Bi) were applied to classify documents to the treatment-change and
no-treatment-change groups. Further, we compared the performances of RNNs to 5
machine learning algorithms including Naive Bayes, K-nearest Neighbor, Support
Vector Machine for classification, Random forest, and Logistic Regression.
Results: Our results suggested that, overall, RNNs outperformed traditional
machine learning algorithms, and LSTM_Bi showed the best performance among the
RNNs in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. In addition,
pretrained word embedding can improve the accuracy of LSTM by 3.4% and reduce the
training time by more than 60%.
Discussion and Conclusion: NLP and RNN-based text mining solutions have
demonstrated advantages in information retrieval and document classification
tasks for unstructured clinical progress notes.

PURPOSE: Diagnosing Ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN) using newly designed
multispectral imaging technique.
METHODS: Eighteen patients with histopathological diagnosis of Ocular Surface
Squamous Neoplasia (OSSN) were recruited. Their previously collected biopsy
specimens of OSSN were reprocessed without staining to obtain auto fluorescence
multispectral microscopy images. This technique involved a custom-built spectral 
imaging system with 38 spectral channels. Inter and intra-patient frameworks were
deployed to automatically detect and delineate OSSN using machine learning
methods. Different machine learning methods were evaluated, with K nearest
neighbor and Support Vector Machine chosen as preferred classifiers for intra-
and inter-patient frameworks, respectively. The performance of the technique was 
evaluated against a pathological assessment.
RESULTS: Quantitative analysis of the spectral images provided a strong
multispectral signature of a relative difference between neoplastic and normal
tissue both within each patient (at p < 0.0005) and between patients (at
p < 0.001). Our fully automated diagnostic method based on machine learning
produces maps of the relatively well circumscribed neoplastic-non neoplastic
interface. Such maps can be rapidly generated in quasi-real time and used for
intraoperative assessment. Generally, OSSN could be detected using multispectral 
analysis in all patients investigated here. The cancer margins detected by
multispectral analysis were in close and reasonable agreement with the margins
observed in the H&E sections in intra- and inter-patient classification,
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the feasibility of using multispectral
auto-florescence imaging to detect and find the boundary of human OSSN. Fully
automated analysis of multispectral images based on machine learning methods
provides a promising diagnostic tool for OSSN which can be translated to future
clinical applications.

Association Prediction.

In recent years, more and more studies have shown that miRNAs can affect a
variety of biological processes. It is important for disease prevention,
treatment, diagnosis, and prognosis to study the relationships between human
diseases and miRNAs. However, traditional experimental methods are time-consuming
and labour-intensive. Hence, in this paper, a novel neighborhood-based
computational model called NBMDA is proposed for predicting potential
miRNA-disease associations. Due to the fact that known miRNA-disease associations
are very rare and many diseases (or miRNAs) are associated with only one or a few
miRNAs (or diseases), in NBMDA, the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) method is utilized
as a recommendation algorithm based on known miRNA-disease associations, miRNA
functional similarity, disease semantic similarity, and Gaussian interaction
profile kernel similarity for miRNAs and diseases to improve its prediction
accuracy. And simulation results demonstrate that NBMDA can effectively infer
miRNA-disease associations with higher accuracy compared with previous
state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, independent case studies of esophageal
neoplasms, breast neoplasms and colon neoplasms are further implemented, and as a
result, there are 47, 48, and 48 out of the top 50 predicted miRNAs having been
successfully confirmed by the previously published literatures, which also
indicates that NBMDA can be utilized as a powerful tool to study the
relationships between miRNAs and diseases.

Based on morphology it is often challenging to distinguish between the many
different soft tissue sarcoma subtypes. Moreover, outcome of disease is highly
variable even between patients with the same disease. Machine learning on
transcriptome sequencing data could be a valuable new tool to understand
differences between and within entities. Here we used machine learning analysis
to identify novel diagnostic and prognostic markers and therapeutic targets for
soft tissue sarcomas. Gene expression data was used from the Cancer Genome Atlas,
the Genotype-Tissue Expression project and the French Sarcoma Group. We
identified three groups of tumors that overlap in their molecular profiles as
seen with unsupervised t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding clustering and
a deep neural network. The three groups corresponded to subtypes that are
morphologically overlapping. Using a random forest algorithm, we identified novel
diagnostic markers for soft tissue sarcoma that distinguished between synovial
sarcoma and MPNST, and that we validated using qRT-PCR in an independent series. 
Next, we identified prognostic genes that are strong predictors of disease
outcome when used in a k-nearest neighbor algorithm. The prognostic genes were
further validated in expression data from the French Sarcoma Group. One of these,
HMMR, was validated in an independent series of leiomyosarcomas using
immunohistochemistry on tissue micro array as a prognostic gene for disease-free 
interval. Furthermore, reconstruction of regulatory networks combined with data
from the Connectivity Map showed, amongst others, that HDAC inhibitors could be a
potential effective therapy for multiple soft tissue sarcoma subtypes. A
viability assay with two HDAC inhibitors confirmed that both leiomyosarcoma and
synovial sarcoma are sensitive to HDAC inhibition. In this study we identified
novel diagnostic markers, prognostic markers and therapeutic leads from multiple 
soft tissue sarcoma gene expression datasets. Thus, machine learning algorithms
are powerful new tools to improve our understanding of rare tumor entities.

PURPOSE: To automatically assess the aggressiveness of prostate cancer (PCa)
lesions using zonal-specific image features extracted from diffusion weighted
imaging (DWI) and T2W MRI.
METHODS: Region of interest was extracted from DWI (peripheral zone) and T2W MRI 
(transitional zone and anterior fibromuscular stroma) around the center of 112
PCa lesions from 99 patients. Image histogram and texture features, 38 in total, 
were used together with a k-nearest neighbor classifier to classify lesions into 
their respective prognostic Grade Group (GG) (proposed by the International
Society of Urological Pathology 2014 consensus conference). A semi-exhaustive
feature search was performed (1-6 features in each feature set) and validated
using threefold stratified cross validation in a one-versus-rest classification
setup.
RESULTS: Classifying PCa lesions into GGs resulted in AUC of 0.87, 0.88, 0.96,
0.98, and 0.91 for GG1, GG2, GG1 + 2, GG3, and GG4 + 5 for the peripheral zone,
respectively. The results for transitional zone and anterior fibromuscular stroma
were AUC of 0.85, 0.89, 0.83, 0.94, and 0.86 for GG1, GG2, GG1 + 2, GG3, and
GG4 + 5, respectively.
CONCLUSION: This study showed promising results with reasonable AUC values for
classification of all GG indicating that zonal-specific imaging features from DWI
and T2W MRI can be used to differentiate between PCa lesions of various
aggressiveness.

PURPOSE: Many studies have proposed predictive models for type 2 diabetes
mellitus (T2DM). However, these predictive models have several limitations, such 
as user convenience and reproducibility. The purpose of this study was to develop
a T2DM predictive model using electronic medical records (EMRs) and machine
learning and to compare the performance of this model with traditional
statistical methods.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, a total of available 8454 patients who had 
no history of diabetes and were treated at the cardiovascular center of Korea
University Guro Hospital were enrolled. All subjects completed 5 years of follow 
up. The prevalence of T2DM during follow up was 4.78% (404/8454). A total of 28
variables were extracted from the EMRs. In order to verify the cross-validation
test according to the prediction model, logistic regression (LR), linear
discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), and K-nearest
neighbor (KNN) algorithm models were generated. The LR model was considered as
the existing statistical analysis method.
RESULTS: All predictive models maintained a change within the standard deviation 
of area under the curve (AUC) <0.01 in the analysis after a 10-fold
cross-validation test. Among all predictive models, the LR learning model showed 
the highest prediction performance, with an AUC of 0.78. However, compared to the
LR model, the LDA, QDA, and KNN models did not show a statistically significant
difference.
CONCLUSION: We successfully developed and verified a T2DM prediction system using
machine learning and an EMR database, and it predicted the 5-year occurrence of
T2DM similarly to with a traditional prediction model. In further study, it is
necessary to apply and verify the prediction model through clinical research.

Nanjing University and Clinical Cancer Institute of Nanjing University, Nanjing, 
China.

Objective: To analyze the recurrence patterns and reasons in patients with
nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy
(IMRT) and to investigate the feasibility of radiomics for analysis of
radioresistance. Methods: We analyzed 306 NPC patients treated with IMRT from
Jul-2009 to Aug-2016, 20 of whom developed with recurrence. For the NPCs with
recurrence, CT, MR, or PET/CT images of recurrent disease were registered with
the primary planning CT for dosimetry analysis. The recurrences were defined as
in-field, marginal or out-of-field, according to dose-volume histogram (DVH) of
the recurrence volume. To explore the predictive power of radiomics for NPCs with
in-field recurrences (NPC-IFR), 16 NPCs with non-progression disease (NPC-NPD)
were used for comparison. For these NPC-IFRs and NPC-NPDs, 1117 radiomic features
were quantified from the tumor region using pre-treatment spectral attenuated
inversion-recovery T2-weighted (SPAIR T2W) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and Pearson correlation coefficient
(PCC) was calculated to identify influential feature subset. Kruskal-Wallis test 
and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis were employed to assess the 
capability of each feature on NPC-IFR prediction. Principal component analysis
(PCA) was performed for feature reduction. Artificial neural network (ANN),
k-nearest neighbor (KNN), and support vector machine (SVM) models were trained
and validated by using stratified 10-fold cross validation. Results: The median
follow up was 26.5 (range 8-65) months. 9/20 (45%) occurred in the primary tumor,
8/20 (40%) occurred in regional lymph nodes, and 3/20 (15%) patients developed a 
primary and regional failure. Dosimetric and target volume analysis of the
recurrence indicated that there were 18 in-field, and 1 marginal as well as 1
out-of-field recurrence. With pre-therapeutic SPAIR T2W MRI images available, 11 
NPC-IFRs (11 of 18 NPC-IFRs who had available pre-therapeutic MRI) and 16
NPC-NPDs were subsequently employed for radiomic analysis. Results showed that
NPC-IFRs vs. NPC-NPDs could be differentiated by 8 features (AUCs: 0.727-0.835). 
The classification models showed potential in prediction of NPC-IFR with higher
accuracies (ANN: 0.812, KNN: 0.775, SVM: 0.732). Conclusion: In-field and
high-dose region relapse were the main recurrence patterns which may be due to
the radioresistance. After integration in the clinical workflow, radiomic
analysis can be served as imaging biomarkers to facilitate early salvage for NPC 
patients who are at risk of in-field recurrence.

Gene expression microarray classification is a crucial research field as it has
been employed in cancer prediction and diagnosis systems. Gene expression data
are composed of dozens of samples characterized by thousands of genes. Hence, an 
accurate and effective classification of such samples is a challenge. Machine
learning techniques have been broadly utilized to build substantial and precise
classification models. This paper proposes a new classification technique for
gene expression data, which is called Modified k-nearest neighbor (MKNN). MKNN is
applied in two scenarios namely; smallest modified KNN (SMKNN) and largest
modified KNN (LMKNN). Both implementations are undertaken to enhance the
performance of KNN. The key idea is to employ robust neighbors from training data
by using a new weighting strategy. Several experiments have been performed on six
different gene expression datasets. Experiments have shown that MKNN in its both 
scenarios outperforms traditional as well as recent ones. MKNN has been compared 
against (i) KNN, (ii) weighted KNN, (iii) support vector machine (SVM), (iv)
fuzzy support vector machine, (v) brain emotional learning (BEL) in terms of
classification accuracy, precision, and recall. On the other hand, results show
that MKNN introduces smaller testing time than both KNN and weighted KNN.

BACKGROUND: Many evidences have demonstrated that circRNAs (circular RNA) play
important roles in controlling gene expression of human, mouse and nematode. More
importantly, circRNAs are also involved in many diseases through fine tuning of
post-transcriptional gene expression by sequestering the miRNAs which associate
with diseases. Therefore, identifying the circRNA-disease associations is very
appealing to comprehensively understand the mechanism, treatment and diagnose of 
diseases, yet challenging. As the complex mechanism between circRNAs and
diseases, wet-lab experiments are expensive and time-consuming to discover novel 
circRNA-disease associations. Therefore, it is of dire need to employ the
computational methods to discover novel circRNA-disease associations.
RESULT: In this study, we develop a method (DWNN-RLS) to predict circRNA-disease 
associations based on Regularized Least Squares of Kronecker product kernel. The 
similarity of circRNAs is computed from the Gaussian Interaction Profile(GIP)
based on known circRNA-disease associations. In addition, the similarity of
diseases is integrated by the mean of GIP similarity and sematic similarity which
is computed by the direct acyclic graph (DAG) representation of diseases. The
kernels of circRNA-disease pairs are constructed from the Kronecker product of
the kernels of circRNAs and diseases. DWNN (decreasing weight k-nearest neighbor)
method is adopted to calculate the initial relational score for new circRNAs and 
diseases. The Kronecker product kernel based regularised least squares approach
is used to predict new circRNA-disease associations. We adopt 5-fold cross
validation (5CV), 10-fold cross validation (10CV) and leave one out cross
validation (LOOCV) to assess the prediction performance of our method, and
compare it with other six competing methods (RLS-avg, RLS-Kron, NetLapRLS, KATZ, 
NBI, WP).
CONLUSION: The experiment results show that DWNN-RLS reaches the AUC values of
0.8854, 0.9205 and 0.9701 in 5CV, 10CV and LOOCV, respectively, which illustrates
that DWNN-RLS is superior to the competing methods RLS-avg, RLS-Kron, NetLapRLS, 
KATZ, NBI, WP. In addition, case studies also show that DWNN-RLS is an effective 
method to predict new circRNA-disease associations.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate whether radiomics can improve the
diagnostic performance of mammography compared with that obtained by experienced 
radiologists.
METHODS: This retrospective study included 173 patients (with 74 benign and 99
malignant lesions) who underwent mammography examination before neoadjuvant
chemotherapy. Radiomic features were extracted from the mammography image of each
patient. Several preprocessing methods, including centering and normalization,
were used along with statistical analysis to reduce and select radiomic features.
Four machine learning algorithms, namely, support vector machine, logistic
regression, K-nearest neighbor, and Bayes classification, were applied to
construct a predictive model. An independent testing data set was used to
validate the prediction ability of the model. The classification performance was 
compared with the diagnostic predictions of two breast radiologists who had
access to the same mammography cases.
RESULTS: A total of 51 radiomic features remained after the preprocessing.
Logistic regression classification presented the best differentiation ability
among the four regression models. The diagnostic accuracy, specificity, and
sensitivity of the logistic regression model for the training data set were
0.978, 0.975, and 0.983, respectively. The diagnostic accuracy, specificity, and 
sensitivity for the testing data set were 0.886, 0.900, and 0.867, respectively. 
The accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity of the combined reading of the two
radiologists were 0.772, 0.710, 0.862 in the training data set and 0.769, 0.695, 
0.858 in the testing data set, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Mammography images could be captured and quantified by radiomics,
which offers a good diagnostic ability for benign and malignant breast tumors and
provides complementary information to radiologists.

Objective: Despite existing prognostic markers, breast cancer prognosis remains a
difficult subject due to the complex relationships between many contributing
factors and survival. This study seeks to integrate multiple clinicopathological 
and genomic factors with dimensional reduction across machine learning algorithms
to compare survival predictions.
Methods: This is a secondary analysis of the data from a prospective cohort study
of female patients with breast cancer enrolled in the Molecular Taxonomy of
Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC). We constructed a series of
predictive models: ensemble models (Gradient Boosting and Random Forest), support
vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural networks (ANN) for 5-year survival
based on clinicopathological and gene expression data after K-means clustering
with K-nearest-neighbor (KNN) classification. Model performance was evaluated by 
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, accuracy, and calibration slope
(CS). Model stability was assessed over 10 random runs in terms of ROC, accuracy,
CS, and variable importance.
Results: The analytic cohort is composed of 1874 patients with breast cancer.
Overall, the median age was 62 years; the 5-year survival rate was 75%. ROC and
accuracy were not significantly different between models (ROC and accuracy around
0.67 and 0.72 across models, respectively). However, ensemble methods resulted in
better fit (CS) with stable measures of variable importance across 10 random
training/validation splits. K-means clustering of gene expression profiles on
training data points along with KNN classification of validation data points was 
a robust method of dimensional reduction. Furthermore, the gene expression
cluster with the highest mortality risk was an influential factor in model
prediction.
Conclusions: Using machine learning methods to construct predictive models for
5-year survival in patients with breast cancer, we demonstrated discrimination
ability across models with new insight into the stability and utility of
dimensional reduction on genomic features in breast cancer survival prediction.

Cancer Type Prediction and Classification Based on RNA-sequencing Data.

Hsu YH, Si D.

Pan-cancer analysis is a significant research topic in the past few years. Due to
many advancing sequencing technologies, researchers possess more resources and
knowledge to identify the key factors that could trigger cancer. Furthermore,
since The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project launched, using machine learning
(ML) techniques to analyze TCGA data has been recognized as a useful solution in 
the line of research. Therefore, this study uses RNA-sequencing data from TCGA
and focuses on classifying thirty-three types of cancer patients. Five ML
algorithms include decision tree (DT), k nearest neighbor (kNN), linear support
vector machine (linear SVM), polynomial support vector machine (poly SVM), and
artificial neural network (ANN) are conducted to compare the performances of
their accuracies, training time, precisions, recalls, and F1-scores. The results 
show that linear SVM with a 95.8% accuracy rate is the best classifier in this
study. Several critical and sophisticated data pre-processing experiments are
also presented to clarify and to improve the performance of the built model.

BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal tumors with poor
prognosis, and lacks of effective biomarkers in diagnosis and treatment. The aim 
of this investigation was to identify hub genes in pancreatic cancer, which would
serve as potential biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and therapy in the future.
METHODS: Combination of two expression profiles of GSE16515 and GSE22780 from
Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database was served as training set. Differentially
expressed genes (DEGs) with top 25% variance followed by protein-protein
interaction (PPI) network were performed to find candidate genes. Then, hub genes
were further screened by survival and cox analyses in The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA) database. Finally, hub genes were validated in GSE15471 dataset from GEO
by supervised learning methods k-nearest neighbor (kNN) and random forest
algorithms.
RESULTS: After quality control and batch effect elimination of training set, 181 
DEGs bearing top 25% variance were identified as candidate genes. Then, two hub
genes, MMP7 and ITGA2, correlating with diagnosis and prognosis of pancreatic
cancer were screened as hub genes according to above-mentioned bioinformatics
methods. Finally, hub genes were demonstrated to successfully differ tumor
samples from normal tissues with predictive accuracies reached to 93.59 and
81.31% by using kNN and random forest algorithms, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: All the hub genes were associated with the regulation of tumor
microenvironment, which implicated in tumor proliferation, progression,
migration, and metastasis. Our results provide a novel prospect for diagnosis and
treatment of pancreatic cancer, which may have a further application in clinical.

Background: Careful identification of nerves during head and neck surgery is
essential to prevent nerve damage. Currently, nerves are identified based on
anatomy and appearance, optionally combined with electromyography (EMG). In
challenging cases, nerve damage is reported in up to 50%. Recently, optical
techniques, like diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) and fluorescence
spectroscopy (FS) show potential to improve nerve identification.
Methods: 212 intra-operative DRS/FS measurements were performed. Small nerve
branches (1-3 mm), on near-nerve adipose tissue, muscle and subcutaneous fat were
measured during 11 surgical procedures. Tissue identification was based on
quantified concentrations of optical absorbers and scattering parameters.
Results: Clinically comprehensive parameters showed significant differences
(<0.05) between the tissues. Classification using k-Nearest Neighbor resulted in 
100% sensitivity and a specificity of 83% (accuracy 91%), for the identification 
of nerve against surrounding tissues.
Conclusions: DRS/FS is a potentially useful intraoperative tool for
identification of nerves from adjacent tissues.
Level of Evidence: Observational proof of principle study.

BACKGROUND: Screening test using CA-125 is the most common test for detecting
ovarian cancer. However, the level of CA-125 is diverse by variable condition
other than ovarian cancer. It has led to misdiagnosis of ovarian cancer.
METHODS: In this paper, we explore the 16 serum biomarker for finding alternative
biomarker combination to reduce misdiagnosis. For experiment, we use the serum
samples that contain 101 cancer and 92 healthy samples. We perform two major
tasks: Marker selection and Classification. For optimal marker selection, we use 
genetic algorithm, random forest, T-test and logistic regression. For
classification, we compare linear discriminative analysis, K-nearest neighbor and
logistic regression.
RESULTS: The final results show that the logistic regression gives high
performance for both tasks, and HE4-ELISA, PDGF-AA, Prolactin, TTR is the best
biomarker combination for detecting ovarian cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: We find the combination which contains TTR and Prolactin gives high 
performance for cancer detection. Early detection of ovarian cancer can reduce
high mortality rates. Finding a combination of multiple biomarkers for diagnostic
tests with high sensitivity and specificity is very important.

BACKGROUND: Arterial blood supply deficiency and venous congestion both play a
role in anastomotic complications. Our aim was to evaluate a software-based
analysis of the fluorescence signal to recognize the patterns of bowel ischemia.
METHODS: In 18 pigs, two clips were applied on the inferior mesenteric artery
(group A: n = 6) or vein (group V: n = 6) or on both (group A-V: n = 6). Three
regions of interest (ROIs) were identified on the sigmoid: P = proximal to the
first clip; C = central, between the two clips; and D = distal to the second
clip. Indocyanine Green was injected intravenously. The fluorescence signal was
captured by means of a near-infrared laparoscope. The time-to-peak (seconds) and 
the maximum fluorescence intensity were recorded using software. A normalized
fluorescence intensity unit (NFIU: 0-to-1) was attributed, using a reference
card. The NFIU's over-time variations were computed every 10 min for 50 min.
Capillary lactates were measured on the sigmoid at the 3 ROIs. Various machine
learning algorithms were applied for ischemia patterns recognition.
RESULTS: The time-to-peak at the ischemic ROI C was significantly longer in group
A versus V (20.1 ± 13 vs. 8.43 ± 3.7; p = 0.04) and in group A-V versus V
(20.71 ± 11.6 vs. 8.43 ± 3.7; p = 0.03). The maximal NIFU at ROI C, was higher in
the V group (1.01 ± 0.21) when compared to A (0.61 ± 0.11; p = 0.002) and A-V
(0.41 ± 0.2; p = 0.0005). Capillary lactates at ROI C were lower in V (1.3 ± 0.6)
than in A (1.9 ± 0.5; p = 0.0071), and A-V (2.6 ± 1.5; p = 0.034). The K nearest 
neighbor and the Linear SVM algorithms provided both an accuracy of 75% in
discriminating between A versus V and 85% in discriminating A versus A-V. The
accuracy dropped to 70% when the ML had to identify the ROI and the type of
ischemia simultaneously.
CONCLUSIONS: The computer-assisted dynamic analysis of the fluorescence signal
enables the discrimination between different bowel ischemia models.

Motivation: Stitching together trans-omics data is a powerful approach to assess 
the complex mechanisms of cancer occurrence, progression, and treatment. However,
the integration process suffers from the "block missing" phenomena when part of
individuals lacks some omics data.
Methods: We proposed a k-nearest neighbor (kNN) weighted imputation method for
trans-omics block missing data (TOBMIkNN) to handle gene-absence individuals in
RNA-seq datasets using external information obtained from DNA methylation probe
datasets. Referencing to multi-hot deck, mean imputation, as well as missing
cases deletion, we assess the relative error, absolute error, inter-omics
correlation structure change and variable selection.
Results: The proposed method, TOBMIkNN reliably imputed RNA-seq data by borrowing
information from DNA methylation data, and showed superiority over the other
three methods in imputation error and stability of correlation structure. Our
study indicates that TOBMIkNN can be used as an advisable method for trans-omics 
block-missing data imputation.

BACKGROUND: Globally the number of cancer patients and deaths are continuing to
increase yearly, and cancer has, therefore, become one of the world's highest
causes of morbidity and mortality. In recent years, the study of anticancer drugs
has become one of the most popular medical topics.
OBJECTIVE: In this review, in order to study the application of machine learning 
in predicting anticancer drugs activity, some machine learning approaches such as
Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Principal components analysis (PCA), Support 
Vector Machine (SVM), Random forest (RF), k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), and Naïve
Bayes (NB) were selected, and the examples of their applications in anticancer
drugs design are listed.
RESULTS: Machine learning contributes a lot to anticancer drugs design and helps 
researchers by saving time and is cost effective. However, it can only be an
assisting tool for drug design.
CONCLUSION: This paper introduces the application of machine learning approaches 
in anticancer drug design. Many examples of success in identification and
prediction in the area of anticancer drugs activity prediction are discussed, and
the anticancer drugs research is still in active progress. Moreover, the merits
of some web servers related to anticancer drugs are mentioned.

Microarray datasets play a crucial role in cancer detection. But the high
dimension of these datasets makes the classification challenging due to the
presence of many irrelevant and redundant features. Hence, feature selection
becomes irreplaceable in this field because of its ability to remove the
unrequired features from the system. As the task of selecting the optimal number 
of features is an NP-hard problem, hence, some meta-heuristic search technique
helps to cope up with this problem. In this paper, we propose a 2-stage model for
feature selection in microarray datasets. The ranking of the genes for the
different filter methods are quite diverse and effectiveness of rankings is
datasets dependent. First, we develop an ensemble of filter methods by
considering the union and intersection of the top-n features of ReliefF,
chi-square, and symmetrical uncertainty. This ensemble allows us to combine all
the information of the three rankings together in a subset. In the next stage, we
use genetic algorithm (GA) on the union and intersection to get the fine-tuned
results, and union performs better than the latter. Our model has been shown to
be classifier independent through the use of three classifiers-multi-layer
perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM), and K-nearest neighbor (K-NN). We
have tested our model on five cancer datasets-colon, lung, leukemia, SRBCT, and
prostate. Experimental results illustrate the superiority of our model in
comparison to state-of-the-art methods. Graphical abstract ᅟ.

City, Indonesia. Email: ricvandana7@gmail.com

Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of
different machine learning algorithms for breast cancer risk calculation.
Methods: A meta-analysis was conducted of published research articles on
diagnostic test accuracy of different machine learning algorithms for breast
cancer risk calculation published between January 2000 and May 2018 in the online
article databases of PubMed, ProQuest and EBSCO. Paired forest plots were
employed for the analysis. Numerical values for sensitivity and specificity were 
obtained from false negative (FN), false positive (FP), true negative (TN) and
true positive (TP) rates, presented alongside graphical representations with
boxes marking the values and horizontal lines showing the confidence intervals
(CIs). Summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curves were applied to
assess the performance of diagnostic tests. Data were processed using Review
Manager 5.3 (RevMan 5.3). Results: A total of 1,879 articles were reviewed, of
which 11 were selected for systematic review and meta-analysis. Fve algorithms
for machine learning able to predict breast cancer risk were identified: Super
Vector Machine (SVM); Artificial Neural Networks (ANN); Decision Tree (DT); Naive
Bayes (NB); and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). With the SVM, the Area Under Curve
(AUC) from the SROC was > 90%, therefore classified into the excellent category. 
Conclusion: The meta-analysis confirmed that the SVM algorithm is able to
calculate breast cancer risk with better accuracy value than other machine
learning algorithms.

Chronic liver diseases are fifth leading cause of fatality in developing
countries. Their early diagnosis is extremely important for timely treatment and 
salvage life. To examine abnormalities of liver, ultrasound imaging is the most
frequently used modality. However, the visual differentiation between chronic
liver and cirrhosis, and presence of heptocellular carcinomas (HCC) evolved over 
cirrhotic liver is difficult, as they appear almost similar in ultrasound images.
In this paper, to deal with this difficult visualization problem, a method has
been developed for classifying four liver stages, that is, normal, chronic,
cirrhosis, and HCC evolved over cirrhosis. The method is formulated with selected
set of "handcrafted" texture features obtained after hierarchal feature fusion.
These multiresolution and higher order features, which are able to characterize
echotexture and roughness of liver surface, are extracted by using ranklet,
gray-level difference matrix and gray-level co-occurrence matrix methods.
Thereafter, these features are applied on proposed ensemble classifier that is
designed with voting algorithm in conjunction with three classifiers, namely,
k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), support vector machine (SVM), and rotation forest. The
experiments are conducted to evaluate the (a) effectiveness of "handcrafted"
texture features, (b) performance of proposed ensemble model, (c) effectiveness
of proposed ensemble strategy, (d) performance of different classifiers, and (e) 
performance of proposed ensemble model based on Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNN) features to differentiate four liver stages. These experiments are carried 
out on database of 754 segmented regions of interest formed by clinically
acquired ultrasound images. The results show that classification accuracy of
96.6% is obtained by use of proposed classifier model.

Early detection of cancer can increase patients' survivability and treatment
options. Medical images such as Mammogram, Ultrasound, Magnetic Resonance
Imaging, and microscopic images are the common method for cancer diagnosis.
Recently, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have been used to help
physicians in cancer diagnosis so that the diagnosis accuracy can be improved.
CAD can help in decreasing missed cancer lesions due to physician fatigue,
reducing the burden of workload and data overloading, and decreasing variability 
of inter- and intra-readers of images. In this research, a framework of CAD
systems for cancer diagnosis based on medical images has been proposed. The
proposed work helps physicians in detection of suspicion regions using different 
medical images modalities and in classifying the detected suspicious regions as
normal or abnormal with the highest possible accuracy. The proposed framework of 
CAD system consists of four stages which are: preprocessing, segmentation of
regions of interest, feature extraction and selection, and finally
classification. In this research, the framework has been applied on blood smear
images to diagnose the cases as normal or abnormal for Acute Lymphoblastic
Leukemia (ALL) cases. Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) has been used to select the
subsets of features from the features extracted from segmented cell parts which
can maximize the classification performance as possible. Different classifiers
which are Decision Tree (DT), K-nearest neighbor (K-NN), Naïve Bayes (NB), and
Support Vector Machine (SVM) have been applied. The framework has been yielding
promising results which reached 96.25% accuracy, 97.3% sensitivity, and 95.35%
specificity using decision tree classifier.

Robust Detection of Audio-Cough Events Using Local Hu Moments.

Monge-Alvarez J, Hoyos-Barcelo C, Lesso P, Casaseca-de-la-Higuera P.

Telehealth has shown potential to improve access to healthcare cost-effectively
in respiratory illness. However, it has failed to live up to expectation, in part
because of poor objective measures of symptoms such as cough events, which could 
lead to early diagnosis or prevention. Considering the burden that these
conditions constitute for national health systems, an effort is needed to foster 
telehealth potential by developing low-cost technology for efficient monitoring
and analysis of cough events. This paper proposes the use of local Hu moments as 
a robust feature set for automatic cough detection in smartphone-acquired audio
signals. The final system feeds a k-nearest-neighbor classifier with the
extracted features. To properly evaluate the system in a diversity of noisy
backgrounds, we contaminated real cough audio data with a variety of sounds
including noise from both indoor and outdoor environments and noncough events
(sneeze, laugh, speech, etc.). The created database allows flexible settings of
signal-to-noise ratio levels between background sounds and events (cough and
noncough). This evaluation was complemented using real patient data from an
outpatient clinic. The system is able to detect cough events with high
sensitivity (up to 88.51%) and specificity (up to 99.77%) in a variety of noisy
environments, overcoming other state-of-the-art audio features. Our proposal
paves the way for ubiquitous cough monitoring with minimal disruption in daily
activities.

Precision Risk Analysis of Cancer Therapy with Interactive Nomograms and Survival
Plots.

Marai GE, Ma C, Burks AT, Pellolio F, Canahuate G, Vock DM, Mohamed ASR, Fuller
CD.

We present the design and evaluation of an integrated problem solving environment
for cancer therapy analysis. The environment intertwines a statistical martingale
model and a K Nearest Neighbor approach with visual encodings, including novel
interactive nomograms, in order to compute and explain a patient's probability of
survival as a function of similar patient results. A coordinated views paradigm
enables exploration of the multivariate, heterogeneous and few-valued data from a
large head and neck cancer repository. A visual scaffolding approach further
enables users to build from familiar representations to unfamiliar ones.
Evaluation with domain experts show how this visualization approach and set of
streamlined workflows enable the systematic and precise analysis of a patient
prognosis in the context of cohorts of similar patients. We describe the design
lessons learned from this successful, multi-site remote collaboration.

Background: To determine the feasibility of radiomic analysis for predicting the 
therapeutic response of gastric carcinoma (GC) with abdominal cavity metastasis
(GCACM) to pulsed low dose rate radiotherapy (PLDRT) using contrast-enhanced
computed tomography (CECT) images.
Methods: Pretreatment CECT images of 43 GCACM patients were analyzed. Patients
with complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) were considered responders,
while stable disease (SD) and progressive disease (PD) as non-responders. A total
of 1,117 image features were quantified from tumor region that segmented from
arterial phase CT images. Intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and absolute 
correlation coefficient (ACC) were calculated for selecting influential feature
subset. The capability of each influential feature on treatment response
classification was assessed using Kruskal-Wallis test and receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) analysis. Moreover, artificial neural network (ANN) and
k-nearest neighbor (KNN) predictive models were constructed based on the training
set (18 responders, 14 non-responders) and the testing set (6 responders, 5
non-responders) validated the reliability of the models. Comparison between the
performances of the models was performed by using McNemar's test.
Results: The analyses showed that 6 features (1 first order-based, 1
texture-based, 1 LoG-based, and 3 wavelet-based) were significantly different
between responders and non-responders (AUCs range from 0.686 to 0.728). Both two 
prediction models based on features extracted from CECT showed potential in
predicting the treatment response with higher accuracies (ANN: 0.714, KNN: 0.749 
for the training set; ANN: 0.816, KNN: 0.816 for the testing set). No statistical
difference was observed between the performance of ANN and KNN (P=0.999).
Conclusions: Pretreatment radiomic analysis using CECT can potentially provide
important information regarding the therapeutic response to PLDRT for GCACM,
improving risk stratification.

Early automatic breast cancer detection from mammograms is based on the
extraction of lesions, known as microcalcifications (MCs). This paper proposes a 
new and simple system for microcalcification detection to assist in early breast 
cancer detection. This work uses the two most recognized public mammogram
databases, MIAS and DDSM. We are introducing a MC detection method based on (1)
Beucher gradient for detection of regions of interest (ROIs), (2) an annulus
model for extraction of few and effective features from candidates to MCs, and
(3) one classification stage with two different classifiers, k Nearest Neighbor
(KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). For dense mammograms in the MIAS
database, the performance metrics achieved are sensitivity of 0.9835, false alarm
rate of 0.0083, accuracy of 0.9835, and area under the ROC curve of 0.9980 with a
KNN classifier. The proposed MC detection method, based on a KNN classifier,
achieves, a sensitivity, false positive rate, accuracy and area under the ROC
curve of 0.9813, 0.0224, 0.9795 and 0.9974 for the MIAS database; and 0.9035,
0.0439, 0.9298 and 0.9759 for the DDSM database. By slightly reducing the true
positive rate the method achieves three instances with false positive rate of 0: 
2 on fatty mammograms with KNN and SVM, and one on dense with SVM. The proposed
method gives better results than those from state of the art literature, when the
mammograms are classified in fatty, fatty-glandular, and dense.

As a molecular and noninvasive detection technology, Raman spectroscopy is
promising for use in the early diagnosis of tumors. The SNR of spectra obtained
from portable Raman spectrometers is low, which makes classification more
difficult. A classification algorithm with a high recognition rate is required.
In this paper, an algorithm of entropy weighted local-hyperplane
k-nearest-neighbor (EWHK) is proposed for the identification of the spectra. When
calculating the weighted distance between the prediction and the sample
hyperplane, EWHK introduces the information entropy weighting to improve the
algorithm of adaptive weighted k-local hyperplane (AWKH). It can reflect all of
the sample information in the classification objectively and improve the
classification accuracy. The breast cancer detection experimental results of EWHK
showed a significant improvement compared with those of AWKH and k-nearest
neighbor (KNN). The EWHK classifier yielded an average diagnostic accuracy of
92.33%, a sensitivity of 93.81%, a specificity of 87.77%, a positive prediction
rate of 95.99% and a negative prediction rate of 83.69% during randomized
grouping validation. The algorithm is effective for cancer diagnosis.

The objective of this work is to develop a computer-aided diagnostic system for
early diagnosis of prostate cancer. The presented system integrates both clinical
biomarkers (prostate-specific antigen) and extracted features from
diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging collected at multiple b values. The
presented system performs 3 major processing steps. First, prostate delineation
using a hybrid approach that combines a level-set model with nonnegative matrix
factorization. Second, estimation and normalization of diffusion parameters,
which are the apparent diffusion coefficients of the delineated prostate volumes 
at different b values followed by refinement of those apparent diffusion
coefficients using a generalized Gaussian Markov random field model. Then,
construction of the cumulative distribution functions of the processed apparent
diffusion coefficients at multiple b values. In parallel, a K-nearest neighbor
classifier is employed to transform the prostate-specific antigen results into
diagnostic probabilities. Finally, those prostate-specific antigen-based
probabilities are integrated with the initial diagnostic probabilities obtained
using stacked nonnegativity constraint sparse autoencoders that employ apparent
diffusion coefficient-cumulative distribution functions for better diagnostic
accuracy. Experiments conducted on 18 diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance
imaging data sets achieved 94.4% diagnosis accuracy (sensitivity = 88.9% and
specificity = 100%), which indicate the promising results of the presented
computer-aided diagnostic system.

Dimensionality reduction of microarray data is a very challenging task due to
high computational time and the large amount of memory required to train and test
a model. Genetic programming (GP) is a stochastic approach to solving a problem. 
For high dimensional datasets, GP does not perform as well as other machine
learning algorithms. To explore the inherent property of GP to generalize models 
from low dimensional data, we need to consider dimensionality reduction
approaches. Random projections (RPs) have gained attention for reducing the
dimensionality of data with reduced computational cost, compared to other
dimensionality reduction approaches. We report that the features constructed from
RPs perform extremely well when combined with a GP approach. We used eight
datasets out of which seven have not been reported as being used in any machine
learning research before. We have also compared our results by using the same
full and constructed features for decision trees, random forest, naive Bayes,
support vector machines and k-nearest neighbor methods.

In cancer classification, gene selection is an important data preprocessing
technique, but it is a difficult task due to the large search space. Accordingly,
the objective of this study is to develop a hybrid meta-heuristic Binary Black
Hole Algorithm (BBHA) and Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO) (4-2) model
that emphasizes gene selection. In this model, the BBHA is embedded in the BPSO
(4-2) algorithm to make the BPSO (4-2) more effective and to facilitate the
exploration and exploitation of the BPSO (4-2) algorithm to further improve the
performance. This model has been associated with Random Forest Recursive Feature 
Elimination (RF-RFE) pre-filtering technique. The classifiers which are evaluated
in the proposed framework are Sparse Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis 
(SPLSDA); k-nearest neighbor and Naive Bayes. The performance of the proposed
method was evaluated on two benchmark and three clinical microarrays. The
experimental results and statistical analysis confirm the better performance of
the BPSO (4-2)-BBHA compared with the BBHA, the BPSO (4-2) and several
state-of-the-art methods in terms of avoiding local minima, convergence rate,
accuracy and number of selected genes. The results also show that the BPSO
(4-2)-BBHA model can successfully identify known biologically and statistically
significant genes from the clinical datasets.

The physical properties of cells are promising biomarkers for cancer diagnosis
and prognosis. Here we determine the physical phenotypes that best distinguish
human cancer cell lines, and their relationship to cell invasion. We use the high
throughput, single-cell microfluidic method, quantitative deformability cytometry
(q-DC), to measure six physical phenotypes including elastic modulus, cell
fluidity, transit time, entry time, cell size, and maximum strain at rates of 102
cells per second. By training a k-nearest neighbor machine learning algorithm, we
demonstrate that multiparameter analysis of physical phenotypes enhances the
accuracy of classifying cancer cell lines compared to single parameters alone. We
also discover a set of four physical phenotypes that predict invasion; using
these four parameters, we generate the physical phenotype model of invasion by
training a multiple linear regression model with experimental data from a set of 
human ovarian cancer cells that overexpress a panel of tumor suppressor
microRNAs. We validate the model by predicting invasion based on measured
physical phenotypes of breast and ovarian human cancer cell lines that are
subject to genetic or pharmacologic perturbations. Taken together, our results
highlight how physical phenotypes of single cells provide a biomarker to predict 
the invasion of cancer cells.

Lymphoma is a significant cancer that affects the human lymphatic and
hematopoietic systems. In this work, discrimination of lymphoma using
laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) conducted on whole blood samples is
presented. The whole blood samples collected from lymphoma patients and healthy
controls are deposited onto standard quantitative filter papers and ablated with 
a 1064 nm Q-switched Nd:YAG laser. 16 atomic and ionic emission lines of calcium 
(Ca), iron (Fe), magnesium (Mg), potassium (K) and sodium (Na) are selected to
discriminate the cancer disease. Chemometric methods, including principal
component analysis (PCA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classification, and 
k nearest neighbor (kNN) classification are used to build the discrimination
models. Both LDA and kNN models have achieved very good discrimination
performances for lymphoma, with an accuracy of over 99.7%, a sensitivity of over 
0.996, and a specificity of over 0.997. These results demonstrate that the
whole-blood-based LIBS technique in combination with chemometric methods can
serve as a fast, less invasive, and accurate method for detection and
discrimination of human malignancies.

Precise nerve localization is of major importance in both surgery and regional
anesthesia. Optically based techniques can identify tissue through differences in
optical properties, like absorption and scattering. The aim of this study was to 
evaluate the potential of optical spectroscopy (diffuse reflectance spectroscopy)
for clinical nerve identification in vivo. Eighteen patients (8 male, 10 female, 
age 53 ± 13 years) undergoing inguinal lymph node resection or resection or a
soft tissue tumor in the groin were included to measure the femoral or sciatic
nerve and the surrounding tissues. In vivo optical measurements were performed
using Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy (400-1600 nm) on nerve, near nerve adipose
tissue, muscle, and subcutaneous fat using a needle-shaped probe. Model-based
analyses were used to derive verified quantitative parameters as concentrations
of optical absorbers and several parameters describing scattering. A total of 628
optical spectra were recorded. Measured spectra reveal noticeable tissue specific
characteristics. Optical absorption of water, fat, and oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin
was manifested in the measured spectra. The parameters water and fat content
showed significant differences (P < 0.005) between nerve and all surrounding
tissues. Classification using k-Nearest Neighbor based on the derived parameters 
revealed a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 79%, for identifying nerve
from surrounding tissues. Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy identifies peripheral 
nerve bundles. The differences found between tissue groups are assignable to the 
tissue composition and structure.

Prevention and early intervention are the most effective ways of avoiding or
minimizing psychological, physical, and financial suffering from cancer. However,
such proactive action requires the ability to predict the individual's
susceptibility to cancer with a measure of probability. Of the triad of
cancer-causing factors (inherited genomic susceptibility, environmental factors, 
and lifestyle factors), the inherited genomic component may be derivable from the
recent public availability of a large body of whole-genome variation data.
However, genome-wide association studies have so far showed limited success in
predicting the inherited susceptibility to common cancers. We present here a
multiple classification approach for predicting individuals' inherited genomic
susceptibility to acquire the most likely phenotype among a panel of 20 major
common cancer types plus 1 "healthy" type by application of a supervised
machine-learning method under competing conditions among the cohorts of the 21
types. This approach suggests that, depending on the phenotypes of 5,919
individuals of "white" ethnic population in this study, (i) the portion of the
cohort of a cancer type who acquired the observed type due to mostly inherited
genomic susceptibility factors ranges from about 33 to 88% (or its corollary: the
portion due to mostly environmental and lifestyle factors ranges from 12 to 67%),
and (ii) on an individual level, the method also predicts individuals' inherited 
genomic susceptibility to acquire the other types ranked with associated
probabilities. These probabilities may provide practical information for
individuals, heath professionals, and health policymakers related to prevention
and/or early intervention of cancer.

Determining whether an asymptomatic individual with Prostate-Specific Antigen
(PSA) levels below 20 ng ml-1 has prostate cancer in the absence of definitive,
biopsy-based evidence continues to present a significant challenge to clinicians 
who must decide whether such individuals with low PSA values have prostate
cancer. Herein, we present an advanced computational data extraction approach
which can identify the presence of prostate cancer in men with PSA levels <20 ng 
ml-1 on the basis of peripheral blood immune cell profiles that have been
generated using multi-parameter flow cytometry. Statistical analysis of immune
phenotyping datasets relating to the presence and prevalence of key leukocyte
populations in the peripheral blood, as generated from individuals undergoing
routine tests for prostate cancer (including tissue biopsy) using
multi-parametric flow cytometric analysis, was unable to identify significant
relationships between leukocyte population profiles and the presence of benign
disease (no prostate cancer) or prostate cancer. By contrast, a Genetic Algorithm
computational approach identified a subset of five flow cytometry features
(CD8+CD45RA-CD27-CD28- (CD8+ Effector Memory cells); CD4+CD45RA-CD27-CD28- (CD4+ 
Terminally Differentiated Effector Memory Cells re-expressing CD45RA); CD3-CD19+ 
(B cells); CD3+CD56+CD8+CD4+ (NKT cells)) from a set of twenty features, which
could potentially discriminate between benign disease and prostate cancer. These 
features were used to construct a prostate cancer prediction model using the
k-Nearest-Neighbor classification algorithm. The proposed model, which takes as
input the set of flow cytometry features, outperformed the predictive model which
takes PSA values as input. Specifically, the flow cytometry-based model achieved 
Accuracy = 83.33%, AUC = 83.40%, and optimal ROC points of FPR = 16.13%,
TPR = 82.93%, whereas the PSA-based model achieved Accuracy = 77.78%,
AUC = 76.95%, and optimal ROC points of FPR = 29.03%, TPR = 82.93%. Combining PSA
and flow cytometry predictors achieved Accuracy = 79.17%, AUC = 78.17% and
optimal ROC points of FPR = 29.03%, TPR = 85.37%. The results demonstrate the
value of computational intelligence-based approaches for interrogating
immunophenotyping datasets and that combining peripheral blood phenotypic
profiling with PSA levels improves diagnostic accuracy compared to using PSA test
alone. These studies also demonstrate that the presence of cancer is reflected in
changes in the peripheral blood immune phenotype profile which can be identified 
using computational analysis and interpretation of complex flow cytometry
datasets.

Combining Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) with endoscopy, it is
expected that noninvasive, rapid detection of colorectal cancer can be performed 
in vivo in the future. In this study, Fourier transform infrared spectra were
collected from 88 endoscopic biopsy colorectal tissue samples (41 colitis and 47 
cancers). A new method, viz., entropy weight local-hyperplane k-nearest-neighbor 
(EWHK), which is an improved version of K-local hyperplane distance
nearest-neighbor (HKNN), is proposed for tissue classification. In order to avoid
limiting high dimensions and small values of the nearest neighbor, the new EWHK
method calculates feature weights based on information entropy. The average
results of the random classification showed that the EWHK classifier for
differentiating cancer from colitis samples produced a sensitivity of 81.38% and 
a specificity of 92.69%.

Platelet derived growth factor beta receptor (PDGFR- β) plays an important role
in angiogenesis. PDGFR-β expression is correlated with increased vascularity and 
maturation of blood vessels in cancer. Pharmacophore modeling and quantitative

structural requirements for ligand-PDGFR-β recognition using 107 known PDGFR-β
inhibitors. Genetic function algorithm (GFA) coupled to k nearest neighbor (kNN) 
and multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis were employed to generate
predictive QSAR models based on optimal combinations of pharmacophores and
physicochemical descriptors. The successful pharmacophores were complemented with
exclusion spheres to optimize their receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC)
profiles. The QSAR models and their associated pharmacophore hypotheses were
validated by identification and experimental evaluation of new angiogenesis
inhibitory leads retrieved from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) structural
database. Two hits illustrated low micromolar IC50 values in two distinct
anti-angiogenesis bioassays.

There is currently much discussion about sample (patient)-specific gene
regulatory network identification, since the efficiently constructed
sample-specific gene networks lead to effective personalized cancer therapy.
Although statistical approaches have been proposed for inferring gene regulatory 
networks, the methods cannot reveal sample-specific characteristics because the
existing methods, such as an L1-type regularization, provide averaged results for
all samples. Thus, we cannot reveal sample-specific characteristics in
transcriptional regulatory networks. To settle on this issue, the NetworkProfiler
was proposed based on the kernel-based L1-type regularization. The
NetworkProfiler imposes a weight on each sample based on the Gaussian kernal
function for controlling effect of samples on modeling a target sample, where the
amount of weight depends on similarity of cancer characteristics between samples.
The method, however, cannot perform gene regulatory network identification well
for a target sample in a sparse region (i.e., for a target sample, there are only
a few samples having a similar characteristic of the target sample, where the
characteristic is considered as a modulator in sample-specific gene network
construction), since a constant bandwidth in the Gaussian kernel function cannot 
effectively group samples for modeling a target sample in sparse region. The
cancer characteristics, such as an anti-cancer drug sensitivity, are usually
nonuniformly distributed, and thus modeling for samples in a sparse region is
also a crucial issue. We propose a novel kernel-based L1-type regularization
method based on a modified k-nearest neighbor (KNN)-Gaussian kernel function,
called an adaptive NetworkProfiler. By using the modified KNN-Gaussian kernel
function, our method provides robust results against the distribution of
modulators, and properly groups samples according to a cancer characteristic for 
sample-specific analysis. Furthermore, we propose a sample-specific generalized
cross-validation for choosing the sample-specific tuning parameters in the
kernel-based L1-type regularization method. Numerical studies demonstrate that
the proposed adaptive NetworkProfiler effectively performs sample-specific gene
network construction. We apply the proposed statistical strategy to the publicly 
available Sanger Genomic data analysis, and extract anti-cancer drug
sensitivity-specific gene regulatory networks.

BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer (PCa) management can benefit from novel
concepts/biomarkers for reducing the current 20-30% chance of false-negative
diagnosis with standard histopathology of biopsied tissue.
METHOD: We explored the potential of selected epigenetic markers in combination
with validated histopathological markers, 3D high-content imaging, cell-by-cell
analysis, and probabilistic classification in generating novel detailed maps of
biomarker heterogeneity in patient tissues, and PCa diagnosis. We used
consecutive biopsies/radical prostatectomies from five patients for building a
database of ∼140,000 analyzed cells across all tissue compartments and for model 
development; and from five patients and the two well-characterized HPrEpiC
primary and LNCaP cancer cell types for model validation.
RESULTS: Principal component analysis presented highest covariability for the
four biomarkers 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, 5-methylcytosine,
5-hydroxymethylcytosine, and alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase in the epithelial
tissue compartment. The panel also showed best performance in discriminating
between normal and cancer-like cells in prostate tissues with a sensitivity and
specificity of 85%, correctly classified 87% of HPrEpiC as healthy and 99% of
LNCaP cells as cancer-like, identified a majority of aberrant cells within
histopathologically benign tissues at baseline diagnosis of patients that were
later diagnosed with adenocarcinoma. Using k-nearest neighbor classifier with
cells from an initial patient biopsy, the biomarkers were able to predict cancer 
stage and grade of prostatic tissue that occurred at later prostatectomy with 79%
accuracy.
CONCLUSION: Our approach showed favorable diagnostic values to identify the
portion and pathological category of aberrant cells in a small subset of sampled 
tissue cells, correlating with the degree of malignancy beyond baseline.

Hepatic fibrosis is a common middle stage of the pathological processes of
chronic liver diseases. Clinical intervention during the early stages of hepatic 
fibrosis can slow the development of liver cirrhosis and reduce the risk of
developing liver cancer. Performing a liver biopsy, the gold standard for viral
liver disease management, has drawbacks such as invasiveness and a relatively
high sampling error rate. Real-time tissue elastography (RTE), one of the most
recently developed technologies, might be promising imaging technology because it
is both noninvasive and provides accurate assessments of hepatic fibrosis.
However, determining the stage of liver fibrosis from RTE images in a clinic is a
challenging task. In this study, in contrast to the previous liver fibrosis index
(LFI) method, which predicts the stage of diagnosis using RTE images and multiple
regression analysis, we employed four classical classifiers (i.e., Support Vector
Machine, Naïve Bayes, Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbor) to build a
decision-support system to improve the hepatitis B stage diagnosis performance.
Eleven RTE image features were obtained from 513 subjects who underwent liver
biopsies in this multicenter collaborative research. The experimental results
showed that the adopted classifiers significantly outperformed the LFI method and
that the Random Forest(RF) classifier provided the highest average accuracy among
the four machine algorithms. This result suggests that sophisticated
machine-learning methods can be powerful tools for evaluating the stage of
hepatic fibrosis and show promise for clinical applications.

Breast cancer encompasses a group of heterogeneous diseases, each associated with
distinct clinical implications. Dozens of molecular biomarkers capable of
categorizing tumors into clinically relevant subgroups have been proposed which, 
though considerably contribute in precision medicine, complicate our
understandings toward breast cancer subtyping and its clinical translation. To
decipher the networking of markers with diagnostic roles on breast carcinomas, we
constructed the diagnostic networks by incorporating 6 publically available gene 
expression datasets with protein interaction data retrieved from BioGRID on
previously identified 1015 genes with breast cancer subtyping roles. The Greedy
algorithm and mutual information were used to construct the integrated diagnostic
network, resulting in 37 genes enclosing 43 interactions. Four genes, FAM134B,
KIF2C, ALCAM, KIF1A, were identified having comparable subtyping efficacies with 
the initial 1015 genes evaluated by hierarchical clustering and cross validations
that deploy support vector machine and k nearest neighbor algorithms. Pathway,
Gene Ontology, and proliferation marker enrichment analyses collectively suggest 
5 primary cancer hallmarks driving breast cancer differentiation, with those
contributing to uncontrolled proliferation being the most prominent. Our results 
propose a 37-gene integrated diagnostic network implicating 5 cancer hallmarks
that drives breast cancer heterogeneity and, in particular, a 4-gene panel with
clinical diagnostic translation potential.

Computer-aided analysis of clinical pathologies is a challenging task in the
field of medical imaging. Specifically, the detection of abnormal regions in the 
frames collected during an endoscopic session is difficult. The variations in the
conditions of image acquisition, such as field of view or illumination
modification, make it more demanding. Therefore, the design of a
computer-assisted diagnostic system for the recognition of gastric abnormalities 
requires features that are robust to scale, rotation, and illumination variations
of the images. Therefore, this study focuses on designing a set of texture
descriptors based on the Gabor wavelets that will cope with certain image
dynamics. The proposed features are extracted from the images and utilized for
the classification of the chromoendoscopy (CH) frames into normal and abnormal
categories. Moreover, to attain a higher accuracy, an optimized subset of
descriptors is selected through the genetic algorithm. The results obtained using
the proposed features are compared with other existing texture descriptors (e.g.,
local binary pattern and homogeneous texture descriptors). Furthermore, the
selected features are used to train the support vector machine (SVM), naive Bayes
(NB) algorithm, k-nearest neighbor algorithm, linear discriminant analysis, and
ensemble tree classifier. The performance of these state-of-the-art classifiers
for different texture descriptors is compared based on the accuracy, sensitivity,
specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) derived by using the CH images. The
classification results reveal that the SVM classifier achieves 90.0% average
accuracy and 0.93 AUC when it is employed with an optimized set of features
obtained by using a genetic algorithm.

PURPOSE: This article examines feature-based nodule description for the purpose
of nodule classification in chest computed tomography scanning.
METHODS: Three features based on (i) Gabor filter, (ii) multi-resolution local
binary pattern (LBP) texture features and (iii) signed distance fused with LBP
which generates a combinational shape and texture feature are utilized to provide
feature descriptors of malignant and benign nodules and non-nodule regions of
interest. Support vector machines (SVMs) and k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classifiers
in serial and two-tier cascade frameworks are optimized and analyzed for optimal 
classification results of nodules.
RESULTS: A total of 1191 nodule and non-nodule samples from the Lung Image Data
Consortium database is used for analysis. Classification using SVM and kNN
classifiers is examined. The classification results from the two-tier cascade SVM
using Gabor features showed overall better results for identifying non-nodules,
malignant and benign nodules with average area under the receiver operating
characteristics (AUC-ROC) curves of 0.99 and average f1-score of 0.975 over the
two tiers.
CONCLUSION: In the results, higher overall AUCs and f1-scores were obtained for
the non-nodules cases using any of the three features, showing the greatest
distinguishability over nodules (benign/malignant). SVM and kNN classifiers were 
used for benign, malignant and non-nodule classification, where Gabor proved to
be the most effective of the features for classification. The cascaded framework 
showed the greatest distinguishability between benign and malignant nodules.

BACKGROUND: An accurate assessment of tumor malignancy grade in the preoperative 
situation is important for clinical management. However, the manual grading of
gliomas from MRIs is both a tiresome and time consuming task for radiologists.
Thus, it is a priority to design an automatic and effective computer-aided
diagnosis (CAD) tool to assist radiologists in grading gliomas.
OBJECTIVE: To design an automatic computer-aided diagnosis for grading gliomas
using multi-sequence magnetic resonance imaging.
METHODS: The proposed method consists of two steps: (1) the features of high and 
low grade gliomas are extracted from multi-sequence magnetic resonance images,
and (2) then, a KNN classifier is trained to grade the gliomas. In the feature
extraction step, the intensity, volume, and local binary patterns (LBP) of the
gliomas are extracted, and PCA is used to reduce the data dimension.
RESULTS: The proposed "Intensity-Volume-LBP-PCA-KNN" method is validated on the
MICCAI 2015 BraTS challenge dataset, and an average grade accuracy of 87.59% is
obtained.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method is an effective method for automatically grading
gliomas and can be applied to real situations.

BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of malignant melanoma (MM) is among the diagnostic
challenges pathologists encounter on a routine basis. Melanoma may arise in
patients with preexisting dysplastic nevi (DN) and it is still the cause of 1.7% 
of all cancer-related deaths. Melanomas often have overlapping histological
features with DN, especially those with severe dysplasia. Nucleotyping for
identifying nuclear textural features can analyze nuclear DNA structure and
organization. The aim of this study is to differentiate MM and DN using these
methodologies.
METHODS: Dermatopathology slides diagnosed as MM and DN were retrieved. The glass
slides were scanned using an Aperio ScanScopeXT at ×40 (0.25 μ/pixel). Whole
slide images (WSI) were annotated for nuclei selection. Nuclear features to
distinguish between MM and DN based on chromatin distributions were extracted
from the WSI. The morphological characteristics for each nucleus were quantified 
with the optimal transport-based linear embedding in the continuous domain. Label
predictions for individual cell nucleus are achieved through a modified version
of linear discriminant analysis, coupled with the k-nearest neighbor classifier. 
Label for an unknown patient was set by the voting strategy with its pertaining
cell nuclei.
RESULTS: Nucleotyping of 139 patient cases of melanoma (n = 67) and DN (n = 72)
showed that our method had superior classification accuracy of 81.29%. This is a 
6.4% gain in differentiating MM and DN, compared with numerical feature-based
method. The distribution differences in nuclei morphology between MM and DN can
be visualized with biological interpretation.
CONCLUSIONS: Nucleotyping using quantitative and qualitative analyses may provide
enough information for differentiating MM from DN using pixel image data. Our
method to segment cell nuclei may offer a practical and inexpensive solution in
aiding in the accurate diagnosis of melanoma.

of Kragujevac, Cacak, Serbia.

of Nis, Nis, Serbia.

BACKGROUND: Mammography is considered the gold standard for early breast cancer
detection but it is very difficult to interpret mammograms for many reason.
Computer aided diagnosis (CAD) is an important development that may help to
improve the performance in breast cancer detection.
OBJECTIVE: We present a CAD system based on feature extraction techniques for
detecting abnormal patterns in digital mammograms.
METHODS: Computed features based on gray-level co-occurrence matrices (GLCM) are 
used to evaluate the effectiveness of textural information possessed by mass
regions. A total of 20 texture features are extracted from each mammogram. The
ability of feature set in differentiating normal, benign and malign tissue is
investigated using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, Naive Bayes
classifier and K-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) classifier. The efficiency of
classification is provided using cross-validation technique. Support Vector
Machine was originally designed for binary classification. We constructed a
three-class SVM classifier by combining two binary classifiers and then compared 
his performance with classifiers intended for multi-class classification. To
evaluate the classification performance, confusion matrix and Receiver Operating 
Characteristic (ROC) analysis were performed.
RESULTS: Obtained results indicate that SVM classification results are better
than the k-NN and Naive Bayes classification results, with accuracy ratio of 65% 
according to 51.6% and 38.1%, respectively.The unbalanced classification that
occurs in all three classification tests is reason for unsatisfactory accuracy.
CONCLUSIONS: Obtained experimental results indicate that the proposed three-class
SVM classifier is more suitable for practical use than the other two methods.

Mappin Street, Sheffield, S1 3JD, UK.

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to develop a novel technique for lung nodule
detection using an optimized feature set. This feature set has been achieved
after rigorous experimentation, which has helped in reducing the false positives 
significantly.
METHOD: The proposed method starts with preprocessing, removing any present noise
from input images, followed by lung segmentation using optimal thresholding. Then
the image is enhanced using multiscale dot enhancement filtering prior to nodule 
detection and feature extraction. Finally, classification of lung nodules is
achieved using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The feature set consists 
of intensity, shape (2D and 3D) and texture features, which have been selected
to optimize the sensitivity and reduce false positives. In addition to SVM, some 
other supervised classifiers like K-Nearest-Neighbor (KNN), Decision Tree and
Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) have also been used for performance
comparison. The extracted features have also been compared class-wise to
determine the most relevant features for lung nodule detection. The proposed
system has been evaluated using 850 scans from Lung Image Database Consortium
(LIDC) dataset and k-fold cross-validation scheme.
RESULTS: The overall sensitivity has been improved compared to the previous
methods and false positives per scan have been reduced significantly. The
achieved sensitivities at detection and classification stages are 94.20% and
98.15%, respectively, with only 2.19 false positives per scan.
CONCLUSIONS: It is very difficult to achieve high performance metrics using only 
a single feature class therefore hybrid approach in feature selection remains a
better choice. Choosing right set of features can improve the overall accuracy of
the system by improving the sensitivity and reducing false positives.

Situin 2 (SIRT2) enzyme is a histone deacetylase that has important role in
neuronal development. SIRT2 is clinically validated target for neurodegenerative 
diseases and some cancers. In this study, exhaustive unsupervised pharmacophore
modeling was combined with quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR)
analysis to explore the structural requirements for potent SIRT2 inhibitors using
146 known SIRT2 ligands. A computational workflow that combines genetic function 
algorithm with k-nearest neighbor or multiple linear regression was implemented
to build self-consistent and predictive QSAR models based on combinations of
pharmacophores and physicochemical descriptors. Successful pharmacophores were
complemented with exclusion spheres to optimize their receiver operating
characteristic curve profiles. Optimal QSAR models and their associated
pharmacophore hypotheses were experimentally validated by identification and in
vitro evaluation of several new promising SIRT2 inhibitory leads retrieved from
the National Cancer Institute structural database. The most potent hit
illustrated IC50 value of 5.4μM. The chemical structures of active hits were
validated by proton nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectroscopy.

Pan-cancer analysis for studying cancer stage using protein and gene expression
data.

Mishra S, Kaddi CD, Wang MD.

Pan-cancer analyses attempt to discover similar features among multiple cancers
to identify fundamental patterns common to cancer development and progression. A 
pan-cancer analysis integrating both protein expression and transcriptomic data
is important because it can identify genes that are linked to proteins
potentially responsible for a patient's status. This study aims to identify
differentially expressed (DE) genes between early and advanced cases of multiple 
cancer types through the usage of RNA sequencing data. The relevance of these
genes is further investigated by developing predictive models using K-nearest
neighbor and linear discriminant analysis classifiers. The use of cancer-specific
and non-cancer specific features resulted in several moderately performing
models. Highlighted genes were further investigated to determine if they encoded 
for proteins identified in a previously conducted pan-cancer analysis. The
results of this study suggest that a pan-cancer analysis may be highly
complementary to standard analyses of individual cancers for identifying
biologically relevant DE genes and can assist in developing effective predictive 
models for cancer progression.

Breast cancer is an important global health problem, and the most common type of 
cancer among women. Late diagnosis significantly decreases the survival rate of
the patient; however, using mammography for early detection has been demonstrated
to be a very important tool increasing the survival rate. The purpose of this
paper is to obtain a multivariate model to classify benign and malignant tumor
lesions using a computer-assisted diagnosis with a genetic algorithm in training 
and test datasets from mammography image features. A multivariate search was
conducted to obtain predictive models with different approaches, in order to
compare and validate results. The multivariate models were constructed using:
Random Forest, Nearest centroid, and K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) strategies as cost
function in a genetic algorithm applied to the features in the BCDR public
databases. Results suggest that the two texture descriptor features obtained in
the multivariate model have a similar or better prediction capability to classify
the data outcome compared with the multivariate model composed of all the
features, according to their fitness value. This model can help to reduce the
workload of radiologists and present a second opinion in the classification of
tumor lesions.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Numerous classification methods are currently
available, but most of them were performed on different datasets. In this paper, 
different classification techniques were used for a diagnostic system on
different skin lesions for the same data, which gives consistency for the data to
have more accurate and better results.
METHODS: Four classification methods were proposed, a classical method based on
K-Nearest Neighbor with Sequential Scanning selection technique for feature
selection, a classical method with complex technique KNN with Genetic Algorithm, 
a complex method based on Artificial Neural Networks with Genetic Algorithm and
an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System.
RESULTS: From the results obtained we can say that the performance of KNN with
optimization of genetic algorithm for the feature selection was the best with an 
accuracy rate of 94%. The Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System result was also
good with an accuracy rate of 92%, and the other techniques' results were also
satisfactory.
CONCLUSION: The improvement on the performance of the classifier depends on the
feature selection methods. In addition, the diagnosis system as a decision
support tool could be used to increase the performance of human experts to make a
correct decision.

Background. Precisely predicting cancer is crucial for cancer treatment. Gene
expression profiles make it possible to analyze patterns between genes and
cancers on the genome-wide scale. Gene expression data analysis, however, is
confronted with enormous challenges for its characteristics, such as high
dimensionality, small sample size, and low Signal-to-Noise Ratio. Results. This
paper proposes a method, termed RS_SVM, to predict gene expression profiles via
aggregating SVM trained on random subspaces. After choosing gene features through
statistical analysis, RS_SVM randomly selects feature subsets to yield random
subspaces and training SVM classifiers accordingly and then aggregates SVM
classifiers to capture the advantage of ensemble learning. Experiments on eight
real gene expression datasets are performed to validate the RS_SVM method.
Experimental results show that RS_SVM achieved better classification accuracy and
generalization performance in contrast with single SVM, K-nearest neighbor,
decision tree, Bagging, AdaBoost, and the state-of-the-art methods. Experiments
also explored the effect of subspace size on prediction performance. Conclusions.
The proposed RS_SVM method yielded superior performance in analyzing gene
expression profiles, which demonstrates that RS_SVM provides a good channel for
such biological data.

The field of personalized and precise medicine in the era of big data analytics
is growing rapidly. Previously, we proposed our model of patient classification
termed Prognostic Signature Vector Matching (PSVM) and identified a 37 variable
signature comprising 36 let-7b associated prognostic significant mRNAs and the
age risk factor that stratified large high-grade serous ovarian cancer patient
cohorts into three survival-significant risk groups. Here, we investigated the
predictive performance of PSVM via optimization of the prognostic variable
weights, which represent the relative importance of one prognostic variable over 
the others. In addition, we compared several multivariate prognostic models based
on PSVM with classical machine learning techniques such as K-nearest-neighbor,
support vector machine, random forest, neural networks and logistic regression.
Our results revealed that negative log-rank p-values provides more robust weight 
values as opposed to the use of other quantities such as hazard ratios, fold
change, or a combination of those factors. PSVM, together with the classical
machine learning classifiers were combined in an ensemble (multi-test) voting
system, which collectively provides a more precise and reproducible patient
stratification. The use of the multi-test system approach, rather than the search
for the ideal classification/prediction method, might help to address limitations
of the individual classification algorithm in specific situation.

Remodeling of the collagen architecture in the extracellular matrix (ECM) has
been implicated in ovarian cancer. To quantify these alterations we implemented a
form of 3D texture analysis to delineate the fibrillar morphology observed in 3D 
Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) microscopy image data of normal (1) and high
risk (2) ovarian stroma, benign ovarian tumors (3), low grade (4) and high grade 
(5) serous tumors, and endometrioid tumors (6). We developed a tailored set of 3D
filters which extract textural features in the 3D image sets to build (or learn) 
statistical models of each tissue class. By applying k-nearest neighbor
classification using these learned models, we achieved 83-91% accuracies for the 
six classes. The 3D method outperformed the analogous 2D classification on the
same tissues, where we suggest this is due the increased information content.
This classification based on ECM structural changes will complement conventional 
classification based on genetic profiles and can serve as an additional
biomarker. Moreover, the texture analysis algorithm is quite general, as it does 
not rely on single morphological metrics such as fiber alignment, length, and
width but their combined convolution with a customizable basis set.

TRAF2- and NCK-interacting kinase (TNIK) represents one of the crucial targets
for Wnt-activated colorectal cancer. In this study, we curated two datasets and
conducted a comprehensive modeling study to explore novel TNIK inhibitors with
desirable biopharmaceutical properties. With Dataset I, we derived Comparative
Molecular Similarity Indices Analysis (CoMSIA) and variable-selection k-nearest
neighbor models, from which 3D-molecular fields and 2D-descriptors critical for
the TNIK inhibitor activity were revealed. Based on Dataset II, predictive
CoMSIA-SIMCA (Soft Independent Modelling by Class Analogy) models were obtained
and employed to screen 1,448 FDA-approved small molecule drugs. Upon experimental
evaluations, we discovered that mebendazole, an approved anthelmintic drug, could
selectively inhibit TNIK kinase activity with a dissociation constant Kd = ~1 μM.
The subsequent CoMSIA and kNN analyses indicated that mebendazole bears the
favorable molecular features that are needed to bind and inhibit TNIK.

This study is trying to assess methods commonly used in content-based image
retrieval (CBIR) for screening mammography analysis. A database consists of 12
different BI-RADS classes related to breast density patterns of mammogram patches
which are taken from IRMA database is used in this study. Three feature
extraction methods, namely grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), principal
component analysis (PCA), and scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) are being 
investigated and compared with prior studies. Two retrieval methods are also used
in this study, namely k-nearest neighbor (KNN) and mutual information (MI) to
measure the similarity between query image and images in database. The result
will be evaluated using positive count rate in each query for each class. The
result of this study is expected to contribute more towards better Computed-Aided

Kidney cancer is of prominent concern in modern medicine. Predicting patient
survival is critical to patient awareness and developing a proper treatment
regimens. Previous prediction models built upon molecular feature analysis are
limited to just gene expression data. In this study we investigate the difference
in predicting five year survival between unimodal and multimodal analysis of
RNA-seq data from gene, exon, junction, and isoform modalities. Our preliminary
findings report higher predictive accuracy-as measured by area under the ROC
curve (AUC)-for multimodal learning when compared to unimodal learning with both 
support vector machine (SVM) and k-nearest neighbor (KNN) methods. The results of
this study justify further research on the use of multimodal RNA-seq data to
predict survival for other cancer types using a larger sample size and additional
machine learning methods.

BACKGROUND: Estrogen receptors (ERs) are nuclear transcription factors that are
involved in the regulation of many complex physiological processes in humans. ERs
have been validated as important drug targets for the treatment of various
diseases, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, osteoporosis, and
cardiovascular disease. ERs have two subtypes, ER-α and ER-β. Emerging data
suggest that the development of subtype-selective ligands that specifically
target ER-β could be a more optimal approach to elicit beneficial estrogen-like
activities and reduce side effects.
METHODS: Herein, we focused on ER-β and developed its in silico quantitative
structure-activity relationship models using machine learning (ML) methods.
RESULTS: The chemical structures and ER-β bioactivity data were extracted from
public chemogenomics databases. Four types of popular fingerprint generation
methods including MACCS fingerprint, PubChem fingerprint, 2D atom pairs, and
Chemistry Development Kit extended fingerprint were used as descriptors. Four ML 
methods including Naïve Bayesian classifier, k-nearest neighbor, random forest,
and support vector machine were used to train the models. The range of
classification accuracies was 77.10% to 88.34%, and the range of area under the
ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve values was 0.8151 to 0.9475,
evaluated by the 5-fold cross-validation. Comparison analysis suggests that both 
the random forest and the support vector machine are superior for the
classification of selective ER-β agonists. Chemistry Development Kit extended
fingerprints and MACCS fingerprint performed better in structural representation 
between active and inactive agonists.
CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that combining the fingerprint and ML
approaches leads to robust ER-β agonist prediction models, which are potentially 
applicable to the identification of selective ER-β agonists.

Adenosine A2A receptor antagonists are of great interest in the treatment for
Parkinson's disease. In this study, we combined extensive pharmacophore modeling 
and quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis to explore the
structural requirements for potent Adenosine A2A antagonists. Genetic function
algorithm (GFA) joined with k nearest neighbor (kNN) analyses were applied to
build predictive QSAR models. Successful pharmacophores were complemented with
exclusion spheres to improve their receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) 
profiles. Best QSAR models and their associated pharmacophore hypotheses were
validated by identification of several novel Adenosine A2A antagonist leads
retrieved from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) structural database. The most 
potent hit illustrated IC50 value of 545.7 nM.

Gene selection is important for cancer classification based on gene expression
data, because of high dimensionality and small sample size. In this paper, we
present a new gene selection method based on clustering, in which dissimilarity
measures are obtained through kernel functions. It searches for best weights of
genes iteratively at the same time to optimize the clustering objective function.
Adaptive distance is used in the process, which is suitable to learn the weights 
of genes during the clustering process, improving the performance of the
algorithm. The proposed algorithm is simple and does not require any modification
or parameter optimization for each dataset. We tested it on eight publicly
available datasets, using two classifiers (support vector machine, k-nearest
neighbor), compared with other six competitive feature selectors. The results
show that the proposed algorithm is capable of achieving better accuracies and
may be an efficient tool for finding possible biomarkers from gene expression
data.

PURPOSE: Clinical staging in patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer misses 
up to 25% of lymph node metastasis. These patients are at high risk for disease
recurrence and improved clinical staging is critical to guide management.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Whole transcriptome expression profiles were generated in 
199 patients who underwent radical cystectomy and extended pelvic lymph node
dissection. The cohort was divided randomly into a discovery set of 133 patients 
and a validation set of 66. In the discovery set features were identified and
modeled in a KNN51 (K-nearest neighbor classifier 51) to predict pathological
lymph node metastases. Two previously described bladder cancer gene signatures,
including RF15 (15-gene cancer recurrence signature) and LN20 (20-gene lymph node
signature), were also modeled in the discovery set for comparison. The AUC and
the OR were used to compare the performance of these signatures.
RESULTS: In the validation set KNN51 achieved an AUC of 0.82 (range 0.71-0.93) to
predict lymph node positive cases. It significantly outperformed RF15 and LN20,
which had an AUC of 0.62 (range 0.47-0.76) and 0.46 (range 0.32-0.60),
respectively. Only KNN51 showed significant odds of predicting LN metastasis with
an OR of 2.65 (range 1.68-4.67) for every 10% increase in score (p <0.001). RF15 
and LN20 had a nonsignificant OR of 1.21 (range 0.97-1.54) and 1.39 (range
0.52-3.77), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The new KNN51 signature was superior to previously described gene
signatures for predicting lymph node metastasis. If validated prospectively in
transurethral resection of bladder tumor samples, KNN51 could be used to guide
patients at high risk to early multimodal therapy.

Microarray-based gene expression profiling has emerged as an efficient technique 
for classification, prognosis, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer. Frequent
changes in the behavior of this disease generates an enormous volume of data.
Microarray data satisfies both the veracity and velocity properties of big data, 
as it keeps changing with time. Therefore, the analysis of microarray datasets in
a small amount of time is essential. They often contain a large amount of
expression, but only a fraction of it comprises genes that are significantly
expressed. The precise identification of genes of interest that are responsible
for causing cancer are imperative in microarray data analysis. Most existing
schemes employ a two-phase process such as feature selection/extraction followed 
by classification. In this paper, various statistical methods (tests) based on
MapReduce are proposed for selecting relevant features. After feature selection, 
a MapReduce-based K-nearest neighbor (mrKNN) classifier is also employed to
classify microarray data. These algorithms are successfully implemented in a
Hadoop framework. A comparative analysis is done on these MapReduce-based models 
using microarray datasets of various dimensions. From the obtained results, it is
observed that these models consume much less execution time than conventional
models in processing big data.

Bcl-2 is an anti-apoptotic protein involved in cancer resistance to cytotoxic
therapies making it an interesting target for inhibitors design. Towards this
end, we implemented an elaborated ligand-based computational workflow that
combines exhaustive pharmacophore modeling and quantitative structure-activity
relationship (QSAR) analysis to explore the structural features required for
potent Bcl-2 inhibitors employing 98 known Bcl-2 inhibitors. Genetic function
algorithm (GFA) coupled with k nearest neighbor (kNN) or multiple linear
regression (MLR) analyses were employed to generate predictive QSAR models based 
on optimal combinations of pharmacophores and physicochemical descriptors. The
optimal QSAR-selected pharmacophore models were validated by receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and by comparison with crystallographic
structures of known inhibitors co-crystallized within Bcl-2 binding pocket.
Optimal QSAR models and their associated pharmacophore hypotheses were validated 
by identification and experimental evaluation of new selective cytotoxic
compounds against Bcl-2 expressing cancer cells. The hits were retrieved from the
National Cancer Institute (NCI) structural database. Several potent hits were
captured. The most potent hits illustrated IC50 values of 4.2 and 2.60 μM against
MDA-MB-231 cancer cell-line.

PURPOSE: To determine how training set size affects the accuracy of
knowledge-based treatment planning (KBP) models.
METHODS: The authors selected four models from three classes of KBP approaches,
corresponding to three distinct quantities that KBP models may predict:
dose-volume histogram (DVH) points, DVH curves, and objective function weights.
DVH point prediction is done using the best plan from a database of similar
clinical plans; DVH curve prediction employs principal component analysis and
multiple linear regression; and objective function weights uses either logistic
regression or K-nearest neighbors. The authors trained each KBP model using
training sets of sizes n = 10, 20, 30, 50, 75, 100, 150, and 200. The authors set
aside 100 randomly selected patients from their cohort of 315 prostate cancer
patients from Princess Margaret Cancer Center to serve as a validation set for
all experiments. For each value of n, the authors randomly selected 100 different
training sets with replacement from the remaining 215 patients. Each of the 100
training sets was used to train a model for each value of n and for each KBT
approach. To evaluate the models, the authors predicted the KBP endpoints for
each of the 100 patients in the validation set. To estimate the minimum required 
sample size, the authors used statistical testing to determine if the median
error for each sample size from 10 to 150 is equal to the median error for the
maximum sample size of 200.
RESULTS: The minimum required sample size was different for each model. The DVH
point prediction method predicts two dose metrics for the bladder and two for the
rectum. The authors found that more than 200 samples were required to achieve
consistent model predictions for all four metrics. For DVH curve prediction, the 
authors found that at least 75 samples were needed to accurately predict the
bladder DVH, while only 20 samples were needed to predict the rectum DVH.
Finally, for objective function weight prediction, at least 10 samples were
needed to train the logistic regression model, while at least 150 samples were
required to train the K-nearest neighbor methodology.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the minimum required sample size needed to accurately
train KBP models for prostate cancer depends on the specific model and endpoint
to be predicted. The authors' results may provide a lower bound for more
complicated tumor sites.

BACKGROUND: Lung cancer remains one of the most common cancers in the world, both
in terms of new cases (about 13% of total per year) and deaths (nearly one cancer
death in five), because of the high case fatality. Errors in lung cancer type or 
malignant growth determination lead to degraded treatment efficacy, because
anticancer strategy depends on tumor morphology.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have made an attempt to evaluate effectiveness of
machine learning algorithms in the task of lung cancer classification based on
gene expression levels. We processed four publicly available data sets. The
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute data set contains 203 samples and the task was to
classify four cancer types and sound tissue samples. With the University of
Michigan data set of 96 samples, the task was to execute a binary classification 
of adenocarcinoma and non-neoplastic tissues. The University of Toronto data set 
contains 39 samples and the task was to detect recurrence, while with the Brigham
and Women's Hospital data set of 181 samples it was to make a binary
classification of malignant pleural mesothelioma and adenocarcinoma. We used the 
k-nearest neighbor algorithm (k=1, k=5, k=10), naive Bayes classifier with
assumption of both a normal distribution of attributes and a distribution through
histograms, support vector machine and C4.5 decision tree. Effectiveness of
machine learning algorithms was evaluated with the Matthews correlation
coefficient.
RESULTS: The support vector machine method showed best results among data sets
from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Brigham and Women's Hospital. All
algorithms with the exception of the C4.5 decision tree showed maximum potential 
effectiveness in the University of Michigan data set. However, the C4.5 decision 
tree showed best results for the University of Toronto data set.
CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning algorithms can be used for lung cancer morphology
classification and similar tasks based on gene expression level evaluation.

The P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux pump has an important role as a natural
detoxification system in many types of normal and cancer cells. P-gp is
implicated in multiple drug resistance (MDR) exhibited by several types of cancer
against a multitude of anticancer chemotherapeutic agents, and therefore, it is
clinically validated target for cancer therapy. Accordingly, in this study we
combined exhaustive pharmacophore modeling and quantitative structure-activity
relationship (QSAR) analysis to explore the structural requirements for potent
P-gp inhibitors employing 130 known P-gp ligands. Genetic function algorithm
(GFA) coupled with k nearest neighbor (kNN) or multiple linear regression (MLR)
analyses were employed to build self-consistent and predictive QSAR models based 
on optimal combinations of pharmacophores and physicochemical descriptors.
Successful pharmacophores were complemented with exclusion spheres to optimize
their receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) profiles. Optimal QSAR models
and their associated pharmacophore hypotheses were validated by identification
and experimental evaluation of new promising P-gp inhibitory leads retrieved from
the National Cancer Institute (NCI) structural database. Several potent hits were
captured. The most potent hit decreased the IC50 of doxorubicin from 0.906 to
0.190 μM on doxorubicin resistant MCF7 cell-line.

microRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in cancer prognosis. They are small
molecules, approximately 17-25 nucleotides in length, and their high stability in
human serum supports their use as novel diagnostic biomarkers of cancer and other
pathological conditions. In this study, we analyzed the expression patterns of
miR-21 and miR-221 in the serum from a total of 100 Egyptian female subjects with
breast cancer, fibroadenoma, and healthy control subjects. Using microarray-based
expression profiling followed by real-time polymerase chain reaction validation, 
we compared the levels of the two circulating miRNAs in the serum of patients
with breast cancer (n=50), fibroadenoma (n=25), and healthy controls (n=25). The 
miRNA SNORD68 was chosen as the housekeeping endogenous control. We found that
the serum levels of miR-21 and miR-221 were significantly overexpressed in breast
cancer patients compared to normal controls and fibroadenoma patients. Receiver
Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis revealed that miR-21 has greater
potential in discriminating between breast cancer patients and the control group,
while miR-221 has greater potential in discriminating between breast cancer and
fibroadenoma patients. Classification models using k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN),
Naïve Bayes (NB), and Random Forests (RF) were developed using expression levels 
of both miR-21 and miR-221. Best classification performance was achieved by NB
Classification models, reaching 91% of correct classification. Furthermore,
relative miR-221 expression was associated with histological tumor grades.
Therefore, it may be concluded that both miR-21 and miR-221 can be used to
differentiate between breast cancer patients and healthy controls, but that the
diagnostic accuracy of serum miR-21 is superior to miR-221 for breast cancer
prediction. miR-221 has more diagnostic power in discriminating between breast
cancer and fibroadenoma patients. The overexpression of miR-221 has been
associated with the breast cancer grade. We also demonstrated that the combined
expression of miR-21 and miR-221can be successfully applied as breast cancer
biomarkers.

OBJECTIVES: Increased adoption of electronic health records has resulted in
increased availability of free text clinical data for secondary use. A variety of
approaches to obtain actionable information from unstructured free text data
exist. These approaches are resource intensive, inherently complex and rely on
structured clinical data and dictionary-based approaches. We sought to evaluate
the potential to obtain actionable information from free text pathology reports
using routinely available tools and approaches that do not depend on
dictionary-based approaches.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We obtained pathology reports from a large health
information exchange and evaluated the capacity to detect cancer cases from these
reports using 3 non-dictionary feature selection approaches, 4 feature subset
sizes, and 5 clinical decision models: simple logistic regression, naïve bayes,
k-nearest neighbor, random forest, and J48 decision tree. The performance of each
decision model was evaluated using sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive
predictive value, and area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC)
curve.
RESULTS: Decision models parameterized using automated, informed, and manual
feature selection approaches yielded similar results. Furthermore, non-dictionary
classification approaches identified cancer cases present in free text reports
with evaluation measures approaching and exceeding 80-90% for most metrics.
CONCLUSION: Our methods are feasible and practical approaches for extracting
substantial information value from free text medical data, and the results
suggest that these methods can perform on par, if not better, than existing
dictionary-based approaches. Given that public health agencies are often
under-resourced and lack the technical capacity for more complex methodologies,
these results represent potentially significant value to the public health field.

BACKGROUND: Selecting a parsimonious set of informative genes to build highly
generalized performance classifier is the most important task for the analysis of
tumor microarray expression data. Many existing gene pair evaluation methods
cannot highlight diverse patterns of gene pairs only used one strategy of
vertical comparison and horizontal comparison, while individual-gene-ranking
method ignores redundancy and synergy among genes.
RESULTS: Here we proposed a novel score measure named relative simplicity (RS).
We evaluated gene pairs according to integrating vertical comparison with
horizontal comparison, finally built RS-based direct classifier (RS-based DC)
based on a set of informative genes capable of binary discrimination with a
paired votes strategy. Nine multi-class gene expression datasets involving human 
cancers were used to validate the performance of new method. Compared with the
nine reference models, RS-based DC received the highest average independent test 
accuracy (91.40%), the best generalization performance and the smallest
informative average gene number (20.56). Compared with the four reference feature
selection methods, RS also received the highest average test accuracy in three
classifiers (Naïve Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbor and Support Vector Machine), and
only RS can improve the performance of SVM.
CONCLUSIONS: Diverse patterns of gene pairs could be highlighted more fully while
integrating vertical comparison with horizontal comparison strategy. DC core
classifier can effectively control over-fitting. RS-based feature selection
method combined with DC classifier can lead to more robust selection of
informative genes and classification accuracy.

Pan-cancer analysis for studying cancer stage using protein expression data.

Mishra S, Kaddi CD, Wang MD.

Pan-cancer analyses attempt to discover similar features among multiple cancers
in order to identify fundamental patterns common to cancer development and
progression. Pan-cancer analysis at the level of protein expression is
particularly important because protein expression is more immediately related to 
patient phenotype than genomic or transcriptomic data. This study aims to analyze
differentially expressed (DE) proteins between early and advanced cases of
multiple cancer types through the usage of reverse-phase protein array data. The 
relevance of these proteins is further investigated by developing predictive
models using K-nearest neighbor and linear discriminant analysis classifiers. The
results of this study suggest that a pan-cancer analysis may be highly
complementary to standard analysis of an individual cancer for identifying
biologically relevant DE proteins, and can assist in developing effective
predictive models for cancer progression.

Classification of vertebral compression fractures in magnetic resonance images
using spectral and fractal analysis.

Azevedo-Marques PM, Spagnoli HF, Frighetto-Pereira L, Menezes-Reis R, Metzner GA,
Rangayyan RM, Nogueira-Barbosa MH.

Fractures with partial collapse of vertebral bodies are generically referred to
as "vertebral compression fractures" or VCFs. VCFs can have different etiologies 
comprising trauma, bone failure related to osteoporosis, or metastatic cancer
affecting bone. VCFs related to osteoporosis (benign fractures) and to cancer
(malignant fractures) are commonly found in the elderly population. In the
clinical setting, the differentiation between benign and malignant fractures is
complex and difficult. This paper presents a study aimed at developing a system
for computer-aided diagnosis to help in the differentiation between malignant and
benign VCFs in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We used T1-weighted MRI of the
lumbar spine in the sagittal plane. Images from 47 consecutive patients (31
women, 16 men, mean age 63 years) were studied, including 19 malignant fractures 
and 54 benign fractures. Spectral and fractal features were extracted from
manually segmented images of 73 vertebral bodies with VCFs. The classification of
malignant vs. benign VCFs was performed using the k-nearest neighbor classifier
with the Euclidean distance. Results obtained show that combinations of features 
derived from Fourier and wavelet transforms, together with the fractal dimension,
were able to obtain correct classification rate up to 94.7% with area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve up to 0.95.

PURPOSE: The goal of this study was to investigate the feasibility of
differentiating brain metastases from different types of lung cancers using
texture analysis (TA) of T1 postcontrast MR images.
METHODS: TA was performed, and four subset textures were extracted and calculated
separately. The capability of each texture to classify the different types of
lung carcinoma was investigated using the Kruskal-Wallis test and receiver
operating characteristic analysis. K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier model and 
back-propagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN) classifier model were used to
build models and improve the predictive ability of TA.
RESULTS: Texture-based lesion classification was highly specific in
differentiating brain metastases originated from different types of lung cancers,
with misclassification rates of 3.1%, 4.3%, 5.8%, and 8.1%, respectively, for
small cell lung carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and large
cell lung carcinoma. The BP-ANN model had a better predictive ability than the
KNN model. No texture feature could distinguish between all four types of lung
cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: TA may predict the differences among various pathological types of
lung cancer with brain metastases. The texture parameters, which reflect the
tumor histopathology structure, may serve as an adjunct tool for clinically
accurate diagnoses and deserves further investigation. Magn Reson Med

BACKGROUND: Solid pseudopapillary neoplasms (SPN) are pancreatic tumors with low 
malignant potential and good prognosis. However, differential diagnosis between
SPN and pancreatic malignancies including pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor
(PanNET) and ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is difficult. This study tried to
identify candidate biomarkers for the distinction between SPN and the two
malignant pancreatic tumors by examining the gene regulatory network of SPN.
METHODS: The gene regulatory network for SPN was constructed by a co-expression
model. Genes that have been reported to be correlated with SPN were used as the
clues to hunt more SPN-related genes in the network according to a shortest path 
approach. By means of the K-nearest neighbor algorithm (KNN) classifier evaluated
by the jackknife test, sets of genes to distinguish SPN and malignant pancreatic 
tumors were determined.
RESULTS: We took a new strategy to identify candidate biomarkers for
differentiating SPN from the two malignant pancreatic tumors PanNET and PDAC by
analyzing shortest paths among SPN-related genes in the gene regulatory network. 
43 new SPN-relevant genes were discovered, among which, we found hsa-miR-194 and 
hsa-miR-7 along with 7 transcription factors (TFs) such as SOX11, SMAD3 and SOX4 
etc. could correctly differentiate SPN from PanNET, while hsa-miR-204 and 4 TFs
such as SOX9, TCF7 and PPARD etc. were demonstrated as the potential markers for 
SPN versus PDAC. 14 genes were demonstrated to serve as the candidate biomarkers 
for distinguishing SPN from PanNET and PDAC when considering them as malignant
pancreatic tumors together.
CONCLUSION: This study provides new candidate genes related to SPN and the
potential biomarkers to differentiate SPN from PanNET and PDAC, which may help to
diagnose patients with SPN in clinical setting. Furthermore, candidate biomarkers
such as SOX11 and hsa-miR-204 which could cause cell proliferation but inhibit
invasion or metastasis may be of importance in understanding the molecular
mechanism of pancreatic oncogenesis and could be possible therapeutic targets for
malignant pancreatic tumors.

A novel hybrid approach for the identification of brain regions using magnetic
resonance images accountable for brain tumor is presented in this paper.
Classification of medical images is substantial in both clinical and research
areas. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) modality outperforms towards diagnosing
brain abnormalities like brain tumor, multiple sclerosis, hemorrhage, and many
more. The primary objective of this work is to propose a three-dimensional (3D)
novel brain tumor classification model using MRI images with both micro- and
macroscale textures designed to differentiate the MRI of brain under two classes 
of lesion, benign and malignant. The design approach was initially preprocessed
using 3D Gaussian filter. Based on VOI (volume of interest) of the image,
features were extracted using 3D volumetric Square Centroid Lines Gray Level
Distribution Method (SCLGM) along with 3D run length and cooccurrence matrix. The
optimal features are selected using the proposed refined gravitational search
algorithm (RGSA). Support vector machines, over backpropagation network, and
k-nearest neighbor are used to evaluate the goodness of classifier approach. The 
preliminary evaluation of the system is performed using 320 real-time brain MRI
images. The system is trained and tested by using a leave-one-case-out method.
The performance of the classifier is tested using the receiver operating
characteristic curve of 0.986 (±002). The experimental results demonstrate the
systematic and efficient feature extraction and feature selection algorithm to
the performance of state-of-the-art feature classification methods.

Microarray technology allows simultaneous measurement of the expression levels of
thousands of genes within a biological tissue sample. The fundamental power of
microarrays lies within the ability to conduct parallel surveys of gene
expression using microarray data. The classification of tissue samples based on
gene expression data is an important problem in medical diagnosis of diseases
such as cancer. In gene expression data, the number of genes is usually very high
compared to the number of data samples. Thus the difficulty that lies with data
are of high dimensionality and the sample size is small. This research work
addresses the problem by classifying resultant dataset using the existing
algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (KNN),
Interval Valued Classification (IVC) and the improvised Interval Value based
Particle Swarm Optimization (IVPSO) algorithm. Thus the results show that the
IVPSO algorithm outperformed compared with other algorithms under several
performance evaluation functions.

AIM: To evaluate whether texture-based analysis of standard MRI sequences can
help in the discrimination between benign and malignant head and neck tumors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The MR images of 100 patients with a histologically
clarified head or neck mass, from two different institutions, were analyzed.
Texture-based analysis was performed using texture analysis software, with region
of interest measurements for 2 D and 3 D evaluation independently for all axial
sequences. COC, RUN, GRA, ARM, and WAV features were calculated for all ROIs. 10 
texture feature subsets were used for a linear discriminant analysis, in
combination with k-nearest-neighbor classification. Benign and malignant tumors
were compared with regard to texture-based values.
RESULTS: There were differences in the images from different field-strength
scanners, as well as from different vendors. For the differentiation of benign
and malignant tumors, we found differences on STIR and T2-weighted images for
2 D, and on contrast-enhanced T1-TSE with fat saturation for 3 D evaluation. In a
separate analysis of the subgroups 1.5 and 3 Tesla, more discriminating features 
were found.
CONCLUSION: Texture-based analysis is a useful tool in the discrimination of
benign and malignant tumors when performed on one scanner with the same protocol.
We cannot recommend this technique for the use of multicenter studies with
clinical data.
KEY POINTS: 2 D/3 D texture-based analysis can be performed in head and neck
tumors. Texture-based analysis can differentiate between benign and malignant
masses. Analyzed MR images should originate from one scanner with an identical
protocol.

BACKGROUND: Classifying cancers by gene selection is among the most important and
challenging procedures in biomedicine. A major challenge is to design an
effective method that eliminates irrelevant, redundant, or noisy genes from the
classification, while retaining all of the highly discriminative genes.
RESULTS: We propose a gene selection method, called local hyperplane-based
discriminant analysis (LHDA). LHDA adopts two central ideas. First, it uses a
local approximation rather than global measurement; second, it embeds a recently 
reported classification model, K-Local Hyperplane Distance Nearest Neighbor(HKNN)
classifier, into its discriminator. Through classification accuracy-based
iterations, LHDA obtains the feature weight vector and finally extracts the
optimal feature subset. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated in
extensive experiments on synthetic and real microarray benchmark datasets. Eight 
classical feature selection methods, four classification models and two popular
embedded learning schemes, including k-nearest neighbor (KNN), hyperplane
k-nearest neighbor (HKNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest are
employed for comparisons.
CONCLUSION: The proposed method yielded comparable to or superior performances to
seven state-of-the-art models. The nice performance demonstrate the superiority
of combining feature weighting with model learning into an unified framework to
achieve the two tasks simultaneously.

Survival time prediction at the time of diagnosis is of great importance to make 
decisions about treatment and long-term follow-up care. However, predicting the
outcome of cancer on the basis of clinical information is a challenging task. We 
now examined the ability of ten different data mining algorithms (Perceptron,
Rule Induction, Support Vector Machine, Linear Regression, Naïve Bayes, Decision 
Tree, k-nearest Neighbor, Logistic Regression, Neural Network, Random Forest) to 
predict the dichotomous attribute "5-year-survival" based on seven attributes
(sex, UICC-stage, etc.) which are available at the time of diagnosis. For this
study we made use of the nationwide German research data set on colon cancer
provided by the Robert Koch Institute. To assess the results a comparison between
data mining algorithms and physicians' opinions was performed. Therefore,
physicians guessed the survival time by leveraging the same seven attributes. The
average accuracy of the physicians' opinion was 59%, the average accuracy of the 
machine learning algorithms was 67.7%.

BACKGROUND: Feature extraction is a key issue in designing a computer aided
diagnosis system. Recent researches on breast cancer diagnosis have reported the 
effectiveness of multiscale transforms (wavelets and curvelets) for mammogram
analysis and have shown the superiority of curvelet transform. However, the curse
of dimensionality problem arises when using the curvelet coefficients and
therefore a reduction method is required to extract a reduced set of
discriminative features.
METHODS: This paper deals with this problem and proposes a feature extraction
method based on curvelet transform and moment theory for mammogram description.
First, we performed discrete curvelet transform and we computed the four
first-order moments from curvelet coefficients distribution. Hence, two feature
sets can be obtained: moments from each band and moments from each level. In this
work, both sets are studied. Then, the t-test ranking technique was applied to
select the best features from each set. Finally, a k-nearest neighbor classifier 
was used to distinguish between normal and abnormal breast tissues and to
classify tumors as malignant or benign. Experiments were performed on 252
mammograms from the Mammographic Image Analysis Society (mini-MIAS) database
using the leave-one-out cross validation as well as on 11553 mammograms from the 
Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM) database using 2×5-fold cross
validation.
RESULTS: Experimental results prove the effectiveness and the superiority of
curvelet moments for mammogram analysis. Indeed, results on the mini-MIAS
database show that curvelet moments yield an accuracy of 91.27% (resp. 81.35 %)
with 10 (resp. 8) features for abnormality (resp. malignancy) detection. In
addition, empirical comparisons of the proposed method against state-of-the-art
curvelet-based methods on the DDSM database show that the suggested method does
not only lead to a more reduced feature set, but it also statistically
outperforms all the compared methods in terms of accuracy.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, curvelet moments are an efficient and effective way to
extract a reduced set of discriminative features for breast cancer diagnosis.

BMRF-MI: integrative identification of protein interaction network by modeling
the gene dependency.

Shi X, Wang X, Shajahan A, Hilakivi-Clarke L, Clarke R, Xuan J.

BACKGROUND: Identification of protein interaction network is a very important
step for understanding the molecular mechanisms in cancer. Several methods have
been developed to integrate protein-protein interaction (PPI) data with gene
expression data for network identification. However, they often fail to model the
dependency between genes in the network, which makes many important genes,
especially the upstream genes, unidentified. It is necessary to develop a method 
to improve the network identification performance by incorporating the dependency
between genes.
RESULTS: We proposed an approach for identifying protein interaction network by
incorporating mutual information (MI) into a Markov random field (MRF) based
framework to model the dependency between genes. MI is widely used in information
theory to measure the uncertainty between random variables. Different from
traditional Pearson correlation test, MI is capable of capturing both linear and 
non-linear relationship between random variables. Among all the existing MI
estimators, we choose to use k-nearest neighbor MI (kNN-MI) estimator which is
proved to have minimum bias. The estimated MI is integrated with an MRF framework
to model the gene dependency in the context of network. The maximum a posterior
(MAP) estimation is applied on the MRF-based model to estimate the network score.
In order to reduce the computational complexity of finding the optimal network, a
probabilistic searching algorithm is implemented. We further increase the
robustness and reproducibility of the results by applying a non-parametric
bootstrapping method to measure the confidence level of the identified genes. To 
evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we test the method on simulation
data under different conditions. The experimental results show an improved
accuracy in terms of subnetwork identification compared to existing methods.
Furthermore, we applied our method onto real breast cancer patient data; the
identified protein interaction network shows a close association with the
recurrence of breast cancer, which is supported by functional annotation. We also
show that the identified subnetworks can be used to predict the recurrence status
of cancer patients by survival analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: We have developed an integrated approach for protein interaction
network identification, which combines Markov random field framework and mutual
information to model the gene dependency in PPI network. Improvements in
subnetwork identification have been demonstrated with simulation datasets
compared to existing methods. We then apply our method onto breast cancer patient
data to identify recurrence related subnetworks. The experiment results show that
the identified genes are enriched in the pathway and functional categories
relevant to progression and recurrence of breast cancer. Finally, the survival
analysis based on identified subnetworks achieves a good result of classifying
the recurrence status of cancer patients.

A Global Covariance Descriptor for Nuclear Atypia Scoring in Breast
Histopathology Images.

Khan AM, Sirinukunwattana K, Rajpoot N.

Nuclear atypia scoring is a diagnostic measure commonly used to assess tumor
grade of various cancers, including breast cancer. It provides a quantitative
measure of deviation in visual appearance of cell nuclei from those in normal
epithelial cells. In this paper, we present a novel image-level descriptor for
nuclear atypia scoring in breast cancer histopathology images. The method is
based on the region covariance descriptor that has recently become a popular
method in various computer vision applications. The descriptor in its original
form is not suitable for classification of histopathology images as cancerous
histopathology images tend to possess diversely heterogeneous regions in a single
field of view. Our proposed image-level descriptor, which we term as the geodesic
mean of region covariance descriptors, possesses all the attractive properties of
covariance descriptors lending itself to tractable geodesic-distance-based
k-nearest neighbor classification using efficient kernels. The experimental
results suggest that the proposed image descriptor yields high classification
accuracy compared to a variety of widely used image-level descriptors.

This paper explores feature reduction properties of independent component
analysis (ICA) on breast cancer decision support system. Wisconsin diagnostic
breast cancer (WDBC) dataset is reduced to one-dimensional feature vector
computing an independent component (IC). The original data with 30 features and
reduced one feature (IC) are used to evaluate diagnostic accuracy of the
classifiers such as k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), artificial neural network (ANN),
radial basis function neural network (RBFNN), and support vector machine (SVM).
The comparison of the proposed classification using the IC with original feature 
set is also tested on different validation (5/10-fold cross-validations) and
partitioning (20%-40%) methods. These classifiers are evaluated how to
effectively categorize tumors as benign and malignant in terms of specificity,
sensitivity, accuracy, F-score, Youden's index, discriminant power, and the
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve with its criterion values including
area under curve (AUC) and 95% confidential interval (CI). This represents an
improvement in diagnostic decision support system, while reducing computational
complexity.

BACKGROUND: Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) has been widely accepted as
the most crucial step in the preoperative assessment of thyroid nodules. Testing 
for the expression of specific genes should improve the accuracy of FNAC
diagnosis, especially when it is performed in samples with indeterminate
cytology.
METHODS: In total, 69 consecutive FNACs that had both cytologic and histologic
diagnoses were collected, and expression levels of 34 genes were determined in
RNA extracted from FNAC cells by using a custom digital mRNA counting assay. A
supervised k-nearest neighbor (K-nn) learning approach was used to build a
2-class prediction model based on a subset of 27 benign and 26 malignant FNAC
samples. Then, the K-nn models were used to classify the 16 indeterminate FNAC
samples.
RESULTS: Malignant and benign thyroid nodules had different gene expression
profiles. The K-nn approach was able to correctly classify 10 FNAC samples as
benign, whereas only 1 sample was grouped in the malignant class. Two malignant
FNAC samples were incorrectly classified as benign, and 3 of 16 samples were
unclassified.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the current data will require further confirmation in a
larger number of cases, the preliminary results indicate that testing for
specific gene expression appears to be useful for distinguishing between benign
and malignant lesions. The results from this study indicate that, in
indeterminate FNAC samples, testing for cancer-specific gene expression
signatures, together with mutational analyses, could improve diagnostic accuracy 
for patients with thyroid nodules.

The breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP) is an important transporter and its
inhibitors play an important role in cancer treatment by improving the oral
bioavailability as well as blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability of anticancer
drugs. In this work, a computational model was developed to predict the compounds
as BCRP inhibitors or non-inhibitors. Various machine learning approaches like,
support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) and artificial neural
network (ANN) were used to develop the models. The Matthews correlation
coefficients (MCC) of developed models using ANN, k-NN and SVM are 0.67, 0.71 and
0.77, and prediction accuracies are 85.2%, 88.3% and 90.8% respectively. The
developed models were tested with a test set of 99 compounds and further
validated with external set of 98 compounds. Distribution plot analysis and
various machine learning models were also developed based on druglikeness
descriptors. Applicability domain is used to check the prediction reliability of 
the new molecules.

Predicting classifier performance with limited training data: applications to
computer-aided diagnosis in breast and prostate cancer.

Clinical trials increasingly employ medical imaging data in conjunction with
supervised classifiers, where the latter require large amounts of training data
to accurately model the system. Yet, a classifier selected at the start of the
trial based on smaller and more accessible datasets may yield inaccurate and
unstable classification performance. In this paper, we aim to address two common 
concerns in classifier selection for clinical trials: (1) predicting expected
classifier performance for large datasets based on error rates calculated from
smaller datasets and (2) the selection of appropriate classifiers based on
expected performance for larger datasets. We present a framework for comparative 
evaluation of classifiers using only limited amounts of training data by using
random repeated sampling (RRS) in conjunction with a cross-validation sampling
strategy. Extrapolated error rates are subsequently validated via comparison with
leave-one-out cross-validation performed on a larger dataset. The ability to
predict error rates as dataset size increases is demonstrated on both synthetic
data as well as three different computational imaging tasks: detecting cancerous 
image regions in prostate histopathology, differentiating high and low grade
cancer in breast histopathology, and detecting cancerous metavoxels in prostate
magnetic resonance spectroscopy. For each task, the relationships between 3
distinct classifiers (k-nearest neighbor, naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine)
are explored. Further quantitative evaluation in terms of interquartile range
(IQR) suggests that our approach consistently yields error rates with lower
variability (mean IQRs of 0.0070, 0.0127, and 0.0140) than a traditional RRS
approach (mean IQRs of 0.0297, 0.0779, and 0.305) that does not employ
cross-validation sampling for all three datasets.

Combining docking-based comparative intermolecular contacts analysis and
k-nearest neighbor correlation for the discovery of new check point kinase 1
inhibitors.

Check point kinase 1 (Chk1) is an important protein in G2 phase checkpoint arrest
required by cancer cells to maintain cell cycle and to prevent cell death.
Therefore, Chk1 inhibitors should have potential as anti-cancer therapeutics.
Docking-based comparative intermolecular contacts analysis (dbCICA) is a new
three-dimensional quantitative structure activity relationship method that
depends on the quality and number of contact points between docked ligands and
binding pocket amino acid residues. In this presented work we implemented a novel
combination of k-nearest neighbor/genetic function algorithm modeling coupled
with dbCICA to select critical ligand-Chk1 contacts capable of explaining
anti-Chk1 bioactivity among a long list of inhibitors. The finest set of contacts
were translated into two valid pharmacophore hypotheses that were used as 3D
search queries to screen the National Cancer Institute's structural database for 
new Chk1 inhibitors. Three potent Chk1 inhibitors were discovered with IC50
values ranging from 2.4 to 69.7 µM.

BACKGROUND: Human Papillomavirus (HPV) genotyping is an important approach to
fight cervical cancer due to the relevant information regarding risk
stratification for diagnosis and the better understanding of the relationship of 
HPV with carcinogenesis. This paper proposed two new feature extraction
techniques, i.e. ChaosCentroid and ChaosFrequency, for predicting HPV genotypes
associated with the cancer. The additional diversified 12 HPV genotypes, i.e.
types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 45, 52, 53, 58, and 66, were studied in this
paper. In our proposed techniques, a partitioned Chaos Game Representation (CGR) 
is deployed to represent HPV genomes. ChaosCentroid captures the structure of
sequences in terms of centroid of each sub-region with Euclidean distances among 
the centroids and the center of CGR as the relations of all sub-regions.
ChaosFrequency extracts the statistical distribution of mono-, di-, or higher
order nucleotides along HPV genomes and forms a matrix of frequency of dots in
each sub-region. For performance evaluation, four different types of classifiers,
i.e. Multi-layer Perceptron, Radial Basis Function, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Fuzzy
K-Nearest Neighbor Techniques were deployed, and our best results from each
classifier were compared with the NCBI genotyping tool.
RESULTS: The experimental results obtained by four different classifiers are in
the same trend. ChaosCentroid gave considerably higher performance than
ChaosFrequency when the input length is one but it was moderately lower than
ChaosFrequency when the input length is two. Both proposed techniques yielded
almost or exactly the best performance when the input length is more than three. 
But there is no significance between our proposed techniques and the comparative 
alignment method.
CONCLUSIONS: Our proposed alignment-free and scale-independent method can
successfully transform HPV genomes with 7,000 - 10,000 base pairs into features
of 1 - 11 dimensions. This signifies that our ChaosCentroid and ChaosFrequency
can be served as the effective feature extraction techniques for predicting the
HPV genotypes.

BACKGROUND: The process of retrieving similar cases in a case-based reasoning
system is considered a big challenge for gene expression data sets. The huge
number of gene expression values generated by microarray technology leads to
complex data sets and similarity measures for high-dimensional data are
problematic. Hence, gene expression similarity measurements require numerous
machine-learning and data-mining techniques, such as feature selection and
dimensionality reduction, to be incorporated into the retrieval process.
METHODS: This article proposes a case-based retrieval framework that uses a
k-nearest-neighbor classifier with a weighted-feature-based similarity to
retrieve previously treated patients based on their gene expression profiles.
RESULTS: The herein-proposed methodology is validated on several data sets: a
childhood leukemia data set collected from The Children's Hospital at Westmead,
as well as the Colon cancer, the National Cancer Institute (NCI), and the
Prostate cancer data sets. Results obtained by the proposed framework in
retrieving patients of the data sets who are similar to new patients are as
follows: 96% accuracy on the childhood leukemia data set, 95% on the NCI data
set, 93% on the Colon cancer data set, and 98% on the Prostate cancer data set.
CONCLUSION: The designed case-based retrieval framework is an appropriate choice 
for retrieving previous patients who are similar to a new patient, on the basis
of their gene expression data, for better diagnosis and treatment of childhood
leukemia. Moreover, this framework can be applied to other gene expression data
sets using some or all of its steps.

PURPOSE: To develop and evaluate the clinical applicability of advanced machine
learning models that simultaneously predict multiple optimization objective
function weights from patient geometry for intensity-modulated radiation therapy 
of prostate cancer.
METHODS: A previously developed inverse optimization method was applied
retrospectively to determine optimal objective function weights for 315 treated
patients. The authors used an overlap volume ratio (OV) of bladder and rectum for
different PTV expansions and overlap volume histogram slopes (OVSR and OVSB for
the rectum and bladder, respectively) as explanatory variables that quantify
patient geometry. Using the optimal weights as ground truth, the authors trained 
and applied three prediction models: logistic regression (LR), multinomial
logistic regression (MLR), and weighted K-nearest neighbor (KNN). The population 
average of the optimal objective function weights was also calculated.
RESULTS: The OV at 0.4 cm and OVSR at 0.1 cm features were found to be the most
predictive of the weights. The authors observed comparable performance (i.e., no 
statistically significant difference) between LR, MLR, and KNN methodologies,
with LR appearing to perform the best. All three machine learning models
outperformed the population average by a statistically significant amount over a 
range of clinical metrics including bladder/rectum V53Gy, bladder/rectum V70Gy,
and dose to the bladder, rectum, CTV, and PTV. When comparing the weights
directly, the LR model predicted bladder and rectum weights that had, on average,
a 73% and 74% relative improvement over the population average weights,
respectively. The treatment plans resulting from the LR weights had, on average, 
a rectum V70Gy that was 35% closer to the clinical plan and a bladder V70Gy that 
was 29% closer, compared to the population average weights. Similar results were 
observed for all other clinical metrics.
CONCLUSIONS: The authors demonstrated that the KNN and MLR weight prediction
methodologies perform comparably to the LR model and can produce clinical quality
treatment plans by simultaneously predicting multiple weights that capture
trade-offs associated with sparing multiple OARs.

Breast cancer remains a global health concern with a lack of high discriminating 
prediction models. The k-nearest-neighbor algorithm (kNN) estimates individual
risks using an intuitive tool. This study compares the performances of this
approach with the Cox and the Gail models for the 5-year breast cancer risk
prediction. The study included 64,995 women from the French E3N prospective
cohort. The sample was divided into a learning (N = 51,821) series to learn the
models using fivefold cross-validation and a validation (N = 13,174) series to
evaluate them. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)
and the expected over observed number of cases (E/O) ratio were estimated. In the
two series, 393 and 78 premenopausal and 537 and 98 postmenopausal breast cancers
were diagnosed. The discrimination values of the best combinations of predictors 
obtained from cross-validation ranged from 0.59 to 0.60. In the validation
series, the AUC values in premenopausal and postmenopausal women were 0.583
[0.520; 0.646] and 0.621 [0.563; 0.679] using the kNN and 0.565 [0.500; 0.631]
and 0.617 [0.561; 0.673] using the Cox model. The E/O ratios were 1.26 and 1.28
in premenopausal women and 1.44 and 1.40 in postmenopausal women. The applied
Gail model provided AUC values of 0.614 [0.554; 0.675] and 0.549 [0.495; 0.604]
and E/O ratios of 0.78 and 1.12. This study shows that the prediction
performances differed according to menopausal status when using parametric
statistical tools. The k-nearest-neighbor approach performed well, and
discrimination was improved in postmenopausal women compared with the Gail model.

Comparative analysis of breast cancer detection in mammograms and thermograms.

Milosevic M, Jankovic D, Peulic A.

In this paper, we present a system based on feature extraction techniques for
detecting abnormal patterns in digital mammograms and thermograms. A comparative 
study of texture-analysis methods is performed for three image groups: mammograms
from the Mammographic Image Analysis Society mammographic database; digital
mammograms from the local database; and thermography images of the breast. Also, 
we present a procedure for the automatic separation of the breast region from the
mammograms. Computed features based on gray-level co-occurrence matrices are used
to evaluate the effectiveness of textural information possessed by mass regions. 
A total of 20 texture features are extracted from the region of interest. The
ability of feature set in differentiating abnormal from normal tissue is
investigated using a support vector machine classifier, Naive Bayes classifier
and K-Nearest Neighbor classifier. To evaluate the classification performance,
five-fold cross-validation method and receiver operating characteristic analysis 
was performed.

In this paper, a chaotic particle swarm optimization with mutation-based
classifier particle swarm optimization is proposed to classify patterns of
different classes in the feature space. The introduced mutation operators and
chaotic sequences allows us to overcome the problem of early convergence into a
local minima associated with particle swarm optimization algorithms. That is, the
mutation operator sharpens the convergence and it tunes the best possible
solution. Furthermore, to remove the irrelevant data and reduce the
dimensionality of medical datasets, a feature selection approach using binary
version of the proposed particle swarm optimization is introduced. In order to
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed classifier, mutation-based
classifier particle swarm optimization, it is checked out with three sets of data
classifications namely, Wisconsin diagnostic breast cancer, Wisconsin breast
cancer and heart-statlog, with different feature vector dimensions. The proposed 
algorithm is compared with different classifier algorithms including k-nearest
neighbor, as a conventional classifier, particle swarm-classifier, genetic
algorithm, and Imperialist competitive algorithm-classifier, as more
sophisticated ones. The performance of each classifier was evaluated by
calculating the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and Matthews's correlation
coefficient. The experimental results show that the mutation-based classifier
particle swarm optimization unequivocally performs better than all the compared
algorithms.

The diagnostic of human breast cancer is an intricate process and specific
indicators may produce negative results. In order to avoid misleading results,
accurate and reliable diagnostic system for breast cancer is indispensable.
Recently, several interesting machine-learning (ML) approaches are proposed for
prediction of breast cancer. To this end, we developed a novel classifier
stacking based evolutionary ensemble system "Can-Evo-Ens" for predicting amino
acid sequences associated with breast cancer. In this paper, first, we selected
four diverse-type of ML algorithms of Naïve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor, Support
Vector Machines, and Random Forest as base-level classifiers. These classifiers
are trained individually in different feature spaces using physicochemical
properties of amino acids. In order to exploit the decision spaces, the
preliminary predictions of base-level classifiers are stacked. Genetic
programming (GP) is then employed to develop a meta-classifier that optimal
combine the predictions of the base classifiers. The most suitable threshold
value of the best-evolved predictor is computed using Particle Swarm Optimization
technique. Our experiments have demonstrated the robustness of Can-Evo-Ens system
for independent validation dataset. The proposed system has achieved the highest 
value of Area Under Curve (AUC) of ROC Curve of 99.95% for cancer prediction. The
comparative results revealed that proposed approach is better than individual ML 
approaches and conventional ensemble approaches of AdaBoostM1, Bagging,
GentleBoost, and Random Subspace. It is expected that the proposed novel system
would have a major impact on the fields of Biomedical, Genomics, Proteomics,
Bioinformatics, and Drug Development.

BACKGROUND: The size of medical datasets is usually very large, which directly
affects the computational cost of the data mining process. Instance selection is 
a data preprocessing step in the knowledge discovery process, which can be
employed to reduce storage requirements while also maintaining the mining
quality. This process aims to filter out outliers (or noisy data) from a given
(training) dataset. However, when the dataset is very large in size, more time is
required to accomplish the instance selection task.
OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we introduce an efficient data preprocessing approach
(EDP), which is composed of two steps. The first step is based on training a
model over a small amount of training data after preforming instance selection.
The model is then used to identify the rest of the large amount of training data.
METHODS: Experiments are conducted based on two medical datasets for breast
cancer and protein homology prediction problems that contain over 100000 data
samples. In addition, three well-known instance selection algorithms are used,
IB3, DROP3, and genetic algorithms. On the other hand, three popular
classification techniques are used to construct the learning models for
comparison, namely the CART decision tree, k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), and support
vector machine (SVM).
RESULTS: The results show that our proposed approach not only reduces the
computational cost by nearly a factor of two or three over three other
state-of-the-art algorithms, but also maintains the final classification
accuracy.
CONCLUSIONS: To perform instance selection over large scale medical datasets, it 
requires a large computational cost to directly execute existing instance
selection algorithms. Our proposed EDP approach solves this problem by training a
learning model to recognize good and noisy data. To consider both computational
complexity and final classification accuracy, the proposed EDP has been
demonstrated its efficiency and effectiveness in the large scale instance
selection problem.

Common CT imaging signs of lung diseases (CISL) play important roles in the
diagnosis of lung diseases. This paper proposes a new method of multiple
classifier fusion to recognize the CISLs, which is based on the confusion
matrices of the classifiers and the classification confidence values outputted by
the classifiers. The confusion matrix reflects the historical reliability of
decision-making of a classifier, while the difference between the classification 
confidence values reflects the on-line reliability of its decision-making. The
two factors are merged to determine the weights of the classifiers'
classification confidence values. Then the classifiers are fused in a
weighted-sum form to make the final decision. We apply the proposed classifier
fusion method to combine five types of classifiers for CISL recognition,
including support vector machine (SVM), back-propagation neural network (BPNN),
Naïve Bayes (NB), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) and decision tree (DT). In the
experiments on lung CT images, our method not only brought stable improvements of
recognition performance, compared with single classifiers, but also outperformed 
two well-known methods of classifier fusion, AdaBoost and Bagging. These results 
show that the proposed method is effective and promising.

External beam radiotherapy is commonly prescribed for prostate cancer. Although
new radiation techniques allow high doses to be delivered to the target, the
surrounding healthy organs (rectum and bladder) may suffer from irradiation,
which might produce undesirable side-effects. Hence, the understanding of the
complex toxicity dose-volume effect relationships is crucial to adapt the
treatment, thereby decreasing the risk of toxicity. In this paper, we introduce a
novel method to classify patients at risk of presenting rectal bleeding based on 
a Deterministic Multi-way Analysis (DMA) of three-dimensional planned dose
distributions across a population. After a non-rigid spatial alignment of the
anatomies applied to the dose distributions, the proposed method seeks for two
bases of vectors representing bleeding and non bleeding patients by using the
Canonical Polyadic (CP) decomposition of two fourth order arrays of the planned
doses. A patient is then classified according to its distance to the subspaces
spanned by both bases. A total of 99 patients treated for prostate cancer were
used to analyze and test the performance of the proposed approach, named CP-DMA, 
in a leave-one-out cross validation scheme. Results were compared with supervised
(linear discriminant analysis, support vector machine, K-means, K-nearest
neighbor) and unsupervised (recent principal component analysis-based algorithm, 
and multidimensional classification method) approaches based on the registered
dose distribution. Moreover, CP-DMA was also compared with the Normal Tissue
Complication Probability (NTCP) model. The CP-DMA method allowed rectal bleeding 
patients to be classified with good specificity and sensitivity values,
outperforming the classical approaches.

Among numerous artificial intelligence approaches, k-Nearest Neighbor algorithms,
genetic algorithms, and artificial neural networks are considered as the most
common and effective methods in classification problems in numerous studies. In
the present study, the results of the implementation of a novel hybrid feature
selection-classification model using the above mentioned methods are presented.
The purpose is benefitting from the synergies obtained from combining these
technologies for the development of classification models. Such a combination
creates an opportunity to invest in the strength of each algorithm, and is an
approach to make up for their deficiencies. To develop proposed model, with the
aim of obtaining the best array of features, first, feature ranking techniques
such as the Fisher's discriminant ratio and class separability criteria were used
to prioritize features. Second, the obtained results that included arrays of the 
top-ranked features were used as the initial population of a genetic algorithm to
produce optimum arrays of features. Third, using a modified k-Nearest Neighbor
method as well as an improved method of backpropagation neural networks, the
classification process was advanced based on optimum arrays of the features
selected by genetic algorithms. The performance of the proposed model was
compared with thirteen well-known classification models based on seven datasets. 
Furthermore, the statistical analysis was performed using the Friedman test
followed by post-hoc tests. The experimental findings indicated that the novel
proposed hybrid model resulted in significantly better classification performance
compared with all 13 classification methods. Finally, the performance results of 
the proposed model was benchmarked against the best ones reported as the
state-of-the-art classifiers in terms of classification accuracy for the same
data sets. The substantial findings of the comprehensive comparative study
revealed that performance of the proposed model in terms of classification
accuracy is desirable, promising, and competitive to the existing
state-of-the-art classification models.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Robust, automated segmentation algorithms are required
for quantitative analysis of large imaging datasets. We developed an automated
method that identifies and labels brain tumor-associated pathology by using an
iterative probabilistic voxel labeling using k-nearest neighbor and Gaussian
mixture model classification. Our purpose was to develop a segmentation method
which could be applied to a variety of imaging from The Cancer Imaging Archive.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Images from 2 sets of 15 randomly selected subjects with
glioblastoma from The Cancer Imaging Archive were processed by using the
automated algorithm. The algorithm-defined tumor volumes were compared with those
segmented by trained operators by using the Dice similarity coefficient.
RESULTS: Compared with operator volumes, algorithm-generated segmentations
yielded mean Dice similarities of 0.92 ± 0.03 for contrast-enhancing volumes and 
0.84 ± 0.09 for FLAIR hyperintensity volumes. These values compared favorably
with the means of Dice similarity coefficients between the operator-defined
segmentations: 0.92 ± 0.03 for contrast-enhancing volumes and 0.92 ± 0.05 for
FLAIR hyperintensity volumes. Robust segmentations can be achieved when only
postcontrast T1WI and FLAIR images are available.
CONCLUSIONS: Iterative probabilistic voxel labeling defined tumor volumes that
were highly consistent with operator-defined volumes. Application of this
algorithm could facilitate quantitative assessment of neuroimaging from patients 
with glioblastoma for both research and clinical indications.

A New Direction of Cancer Classification: Positive Effect of Low-Ranking
MicroRNAs.

OBJECTIVES: Many studies based on microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles showed a
new aspect of cancer classification. Because one characteristic of miRNA
expression data is the high dimensionality, feature selection methods have been
used to facilitate dimensionality reduction. The feature selection methods have
one shortcoming thus far: they just consider the problem of where feature to
class is 1:1 or n:1. However, because one miRNA may influence more than one type 
of cancer, human miRNA is considered to be ranked low in traditional feature
selection methods and are removed most of the time. In view of the limitation of 
the miRNA number, low-ranking miRNAs are also important to cancer classification.
METHODS: We considered both high- and low-ranking features to cover all problems 
(1:1, n:1, 1:n, and m:n) in cancer classification. First, we used the
correlation-based feature selection method to select the high-ranking miRNAs, and
chose the support vector machine, Bayes network, decision tree,
k-nearest-neighbor, and logistic classifier to construct cancer classification.
Then, we chose Chi-square test, information gain, gain ratio, and Pearson's
correlation feature selection methods to build the m:n feature subset, and used
the selected miRNAs to determine cancer classification.
RESULTS: The low-ranking miRNA expression profiles achieved higher classification
accuracy compared with just using high-ranking miRNAs in traditional feature
selection methods.
CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that the m:n feature subset made a positive
impression of low-ranking miRNAs in cancer classification.

Classification of cancer patients using traditional methods is a challenging task
in the medical practice. Owing to rapid advances in microarray technologies,
currently expression levels of thousands of genes from individual cancer patients
can be measured. The classification of cancer patients by supervised statistical 
learning algorithms using the gene expression datasets provides an alternative to
the traditional methods. Here we present a new network-based supervised
classification technique, namely the NBC method. We compare NBC to five
traditional classification techniques (support vector machines (SVM), k-nearest
neighbor (kNN), naïve Bayes (NB), C4.5, and random forest (RF)) using 50-300
genes selected by five feature selection methods. Our results on five large
cancer datasets demonstrate that NBC method outperforms traditional
classification techniques. Our analysis suggests that using symmetrical
uncertainty (SU) feature selection method with NBC method provides the most
accurate classification strategy. Finally, in-depth analysis of the
correlation-based co-expression networks chosen by our network-based classifier
in different cancer classes shows that there are drastic changes in the network
models of different cancer types.

The classification of different cancer types owns great significance in the
medical field. However, the great majority of existing cancer classification
methods are clinical-based and have relatively weak diagnostic ability. With the 
rapid development of gene expression technology, it is able to classify different
kinds of cancers using DNA microarray. Our main idea is to confront the problem
of cancer classification using gene expression data from a graph-based view.
Based on a new node influence model we proposed, this paper presents a novel high
accuracy method for cancer classification, which is composed of four parts: the
first is to calculate the similarity matrix of all samples, the second is to
compute the node influence of training samples, the third is to obtain the
similarity between every test sample and each class using weighted sum of node
influence and similarity matrix, and the last is to classify each test sample
based on its similarity between every class. The data sets used in our
experiments are breast cancer, central nervous system, colon tumor, prostate
cancer, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and lung cancer. experimental results
showed that our node influence based method (NIM) is more efficient and robust
than the support vector machine, K-nearest neighbor, C4.5, naive Bayes, and CART.

AIM: To reveal the serum proteomic profiling of intraductal carcinoma (IDC)
patients in China, establish a serum proteome fractionation technique for
choosing magnetic beads for proteomic analysis in breast cancer research; and
identify differentially expressed peptides (m/z; P < 0.0001) as potential
biomarkers of early IDCs.
METHODS: We used two different kinds of magnetic beads (magnetic bead-based weak 
cation exchange chromatography (MB-WCX) and immobilized metal ion affinity
chromatography (MB-IMAC-Cu)) to analyze 32 patients with early stage (stages
I-II) IDC and 32 healthy control serum samples for proteomic profiling by
matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry
(MALDI-TOF MS) analysis. The mass spectra, analyzed using ClinProTools software, 
distinguished between IDC patients and healthy individuals based on k-nearest
neighbor genetic algorithm.
RESULTS: The serum samples purified in the MB-WCX group provided better proteomic
patterns than the MB-IMAC-Cu group. The samples purified by MB-WCX had better
average peak numbers, higher peak intensities, and better capturing ability of
low abundance proteins or peptides in serum samples. In addition, the MB-WCX and 
MB-IMAC-Cu purification methods, followed MALDI-TOF MS identification and use of 
ClinProTools software accurately distinguished patients with early stage IDC from
healthy individuals.
CONCLUSION: Serum proteomic profiling by MALDI-TOF MS is a novel potential tool
for the clinical diagnosis of patients with IDC in China.

Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy has such advantages as being noninvasive, fast, 
relatively inexpensive, and no risk of ionizing radiation. Differences in the NIR
signals can reflect many physiological changes, which are in turn associated with
such factors as vascularization, cellularity, oxygen consumption, or remodeling. 
NIR spectral differences between colorectal cancer and healthy tissues were
investigated. A Fourier transform NIR spectroscopy instrument equipped with a
fiber-optic probe was used to mimic in situ clinical measurements. A total of 186
spectra were collected and then underwent the preprocessing of standard normalize
variate (SNV) for removing unwanted background variances. All the specimen and
spots used for spectral collection were confirmed staining and examination by an 
experienced pathologist so as to ensure the representative of the pathology.
Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to uncover the possible clustering.
Several methods including random forest (RF), partial least squares-discriminant 
analysis (PLSDA), K-nearest neighbor and classification and regression tree
(CART) were used to extract spectral features and to construct the diagnostic
models. By comparison, it reveals that, even if no obvious difference of
misclassified ratio (MCR) was observed between these models, RF is preferable
since it is quicker, more convenient and insensitive to over-fitting. The results
indicate that NIR spectroscopy coupled with RF model can serve as a potential
tool for discriminating the colorectal cancer tissues from normal ones.

An intelligent system for lung cancer diagnosis using a new genetic algorithm
based feature selection method.

Education), Department of Electronic Engineering, Jiangnan University, Wuxi,

In this paper, we develop a novel feature selection algorithm based on the
genetic algorithm (GA) using a specifically devised trace-based separability
criterion. According to the scores of class separability and variable
separability, this criterion measures the significance of feature subset,
independent of any specific classification. In addition, a mutual information
matrix between variables is used as features for classification, and no prior
knowledge about the cardinality of feature subset is required. Experiments are
performed by using a standard lung cancer dataset. The obtained solutions are
verified with three different classifiers, including the support vector machine
(SVM), the back-propagation neural network (BPNN), and the K-nearest neighbor
(KNN), and compared with those obtained by the whole feature set, the F-score and
the correlation-based feature selection methods. The comparison results show that
the proposed intelligent system has a good diagnosis performance and can be used 
as a promising tool for lung cancer diagnosis.

Breast cancer continues to be a significant public health problem in the world.
Early detection is the key for improving breast cancer prognosis. Mammogram
breast X-ray is considered the most reliable method in early detection of breast 
cancer. However, it is difficult for radiologists to provide both accurate and
uniform evaluation for the enormous mammograms generated in widespread screening.
Micro calcification clusters (MCCs) and masses are the two most important signs
for the breast cancer, and their automated detection is very valuable for early
breast cancer diagnosis. The main objective is to discuss the computer-aided
detection system that has been proposed to assist the radiologists in detecting
the specific abnormalities and improving the diagnostic accuracy in making the
diagnostic decisions by applying techniques splits into three-steps procedure
beginning with enhancement by using Histogram equalization (HE) and Morphological
Enhancement, followed by segmentation based on Otsu's threshold the region of
interest for the identification of micro calcifications and mass lesions, and at 
last classification stage, which classify between normal and micro calcifications
'patterns and then classify between benign and malignant micro calcifications. In
classification stage; three methods were used, the voting K-Nearest Neighbor
classifier (K-NN) with prediction accuracy of 73%, Support Vector Machine
classifier (SVM) with prediction accuracy of 83%, and Artificial Neural Network
classifier (ANN) with prediction accuracy of 77%.

Recently, tissue-based methods for proteomic analysis have been used in clinical 
research and appear reliable for digestive, brain, lymphomatous, and lung cancers
classification. However simple, tissue-based methods that couple signal analysis 
to tissue imaging are time consuming. To assess the reliability of a method
involving rapid tissue preparation and analysis to discriminate cancerous from
non-cancerous tissues, we tested 141 lung cancer/non-tumor pairs and 8 unique
lung cancer samples among the stored frozen samples of 138 patients operated on
during 2012. Samples were crushed in water, and 1.5 µl was spotted onto a steel
target for analysis with the Microflex LT analyzer (Bruker Daltonics). Spectra
were analyzed using ClinProTools software. A set of samples was used to generate 
a random classification model on the basis of a list of discriminant peaks sorted
with the k-nearest neighbor genetic algorithm. The rest of the samples (n = 43
cancerous and n = 41 non-tumoral) was used to verify the classification
capability and calculate the diagnostic performance indices relative to the
histological diagnosis. The analysis found 53 m/z valid peaks, 40 of which were
significantly different between cancerous and non-tumoral samples. The selected
genetic algorithm model identified 20 potential peaks from the training set and
had 98.81% recognition capability and 89.17% positive predictive value. In the
blinded set, this method accurately discriminated the two classes with a
sensitivity of 86.7% and a specificity of 95.1% for the cancer tissues and a
sensitivity of 87.8% and a specificity of 95.3% for the non-tumor tissues. The
second model generated to discriminate primary lung cancer from metastases was of
lower quality. The reliability of MALDI-ToF analysis coupled with a very simple
lung preparation procedure appears promising and should be tested in the
operating room on fresh samples coupled with the pathological examination.

In the majority of countries, breast cancer among women is highly prevalent. If
diagnosed in the early stages, there is a high probability of a cure. Several
statistical-based approaches have been developed to assist in early breast cancer
detection. This paper presents a method for selection of variables for the
classification of cases into two classes, benign or malignant, based on
cytopathological analysis of breast cell samples of patients. The variables are
ranked according to a new index of importance of variables that combines the
weighting importance of Principal Component Analysis and the explained variance
based on each retained component. Observations from the test sample are
categorized into two classes using the k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm and
Discriminant Analysis, followed by elimination of the variable with the index of 
lowest importance. The subset with the highest accuracy is used to classify
observations in the test sample. When applied to the Wisconsin Breast Cancer
Database, the proposed method led to average of 97.77% in classification accuracy
while retaining an average of 5.8 variables.

Hardware friendly probabilistic spiking neural network with long-term and
short-term plasticity.

Hsieh HY, Tang KT.

This paper proposes a probabilistic spiking neural network (PSNN) with unimodal
weight distribution, possessing long- and short-term plasticity. The proposed
algorithm is derived by both the arithmetic gradient decent calculation and
bioinspired algorithms. The algorithm is benchmarked by the Iris and Wisconsin
breast cancer (WBC) data sets. The network features fast convergence speed and
high accuracy. In the experiment, the PSNN took not more than 40 epochs for
convergence. The average testing accuracy for Iris and WBC data is 96.7% and
97.2%, respectively. To test the usefulness of the PSNN to real world
application, the PSNN was also tested with the odor data, which was collected by 
our self-developed electronic nose (e-nose). Compared with the algorithm
(K-nearest neighbor) that has the highest classification accuracy in the e-nose
for the same odor data, the classification accuracy of the PSNN is only 1.3% less
but the memory requirement can be reduced at least 40%. All the experiments
suggest that the PSNN is hardware friendly. First, it requires only nine-bits
weight resolution for training and testing. Second, the PSNN can learn complex
data sets with a little number of neurons that in turn reduce the cost of VLSI
implementation. In addition, the algorithm is insensitive to synaptic noise and
the parameter variation induced by the VLSI fabrication. Therefore, the algorithm
can be implemented by either software or hardware, making it suitable for wider
application.

An automated medical diagnosis system has been developed to discriminate benign
and malignant thyroid nodules in multi-stained fine needle aspiration biopsy
(FNAB) images using multiple classifier fusion and presented in this paper.
First, thyroid cell regions are extracted from the auto-cropped sub-image by
implementing mathematical morphology segmentation method. Subsequently,
statistical features are extracted by two-level wavelet decomposition based on
texture characteristics of the thyroid cells. After that, decision tree (DT),
k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), Elman neural network (ENN) and support vector machine 
(SVM) classifiers are used separately to classify thyroid nodules into benign and
malignant. The four individual classifier outputs are then fused together using
majority voting rule and linear combination rules to improve the performance of
the diagnostic system. The classification results of ENN and SVM classifiers show
an overall diagnostic accuracy (DA) of 90%, sensitivity (Se) of 85% and 100%,
specificity (Sp) of 90% and 90% respectively. However, the best diagnostic
accuracy of 96.66% is obtained by multiple classifier fusion with majority voting
rule and linear combination rules. The experimental results show that the
proposed method is a useful tool for the diagnosis of thyroid cancer and can
provide a second opinion for a physician's decision.

BACKGROUND: The number of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has increased
rapidly in the past couple of years, resulting in the identification of genes
associated with different diseases. The next step in translating these findings
into biomedically useful information is to find out the mechanism of the action
of these genes. However, GWAS studies often implicate genes whose functions are
currently unknown; for example, MYEOV, ANKLE1, TMEM45B and ORAOV1 are found to be
associated with breast cancer, but their molecular function is unknown.
RESULTS: We carried out Bayesian inference of Gene Ontology (GO) term annotations
of genes by employing the directed acyclic graph structure of GO and the network 
of protein-protein interactions (PPIs). The approach is designed based on the
fact that two proteins that interact biophysically would be in physical proximity
of each other, would possess complementary molecular function, and play role in
related biological processes. Predicted GO terms were ranked according to their
relative association scores and the approach was evaluated quantitatively by
plotting the precision versus recall values and F-scores (the harmonic mean of
precision and recall) versus varying thresholds. Precisions of ~58% and ~ 40% for
localization and functions respectively of proteins were determined at a
threshold of ~30 (top 30 GO terms in the ranked list). Comparison with function
prediction based on semantic similarity among nodes in an ontology and
incorporation of those similarities in a k-nearest neighbor classifier confirmed 
that our results compared favorably.
CONCLUSIONS: This approach was applied to predict the cellular component and
molecular function GO terms of all human proteins that have interacting partners 
possessing at least one known GO annotation. The list of predictions is available
at http://severus.dbmi.pitt.edu/engo/GOPRED.html. We present the algorithm,
evaluations and the results of the computational predictions, especially for
genes identified in GWAS studies to be associated with diseases, which are of
translational interest.

Machine learning-based prediction of drug-drug interactions by integrating drug
phenotypic, therapeutic, chemical, and genomic properties.

OBJECTIVE: Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are an important consideration in both
drug development and clinical application, especially for co-administered
medications. While it is necessary to identify all possible DDIs during clinical 
trials, DDIs are frequently reported after the drugs are approved for clinical
use, and they are a common cause of adverse drug reactions (ADR) and increasing
healthcare costs. Computational prediction may assist in identifying potential
DDIs during clinical trials.
METHODS: Here we propose a heterogeneous network-assisted inference (HNAI)
framework to assist with the prediction of DDIs. First, we constructed a
comprehensive DDI network that contained 6946 unique DDI pairs connecting 721
approved drugs based on DrugBank data. Next, we calculated drug-drug pair
similarities using four features: phenotypic similarity based on a comprehensive 
drug-ADR network, therapeutic similarity based on the drug Anatomical Therapeutic
Chemical classification system, chemical structural similarity from SMILES data, 
and genomic similarity based on a large drug-target interaction network built
using the DrugBank and Therapeutic Target Database. Finally, we applied five
predictive models in the HNAI framework: naive Bayes, decision tree, k-nearest
neighbor, logistic regression, and support vector machine, respectively.
RESULTS: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the HNAI
models is 0.67 as evaluated using fivefold cross-validation. Using antipsychotic 
drugs as an example, several HNAI-predicted DDIs that involve weight gain and
cytochrome P450 inhibition were supported by literature resources.
CONCLUSIONS: Through machine learning-based integration of drug phenotypic,
therapeutic, structural, and genomic similarities, we demonstrated that HNAI is
promising for uncovering DDIs in drug development and postmarketing surveillance.

Feature weight estimation for gene selection: a local hyperlinear learning
approach.

Technology, Guangdong, China. hmcai@scut.edu.cn.

BACKGROUND: Modeling high-dimensional data involving thousands of variables is
particularly important for gene expression profiling experiments, nevertheless,it
remains a challenging task. One of the challenges is to implement an effective
method for selecting a small set of relevant genes, buried in high-dimensional
irrelevant noises. RELIEF is a popular and widely used approach for feature
selection owing to its low computational cost and high accuracy. However, RELIEF 
based methods suffer from instability, especially in the presence of noisy and/or
high-dimensional outliers.
RESULTS: We propose an innovative feature weighting algorithm, called LHR, to
select informative genes from highly noisy data. LHR is based on RELIEF for
feature weighting using classical margin maximization. The key idea of LHR is to 
estimate the feature weights through local approximation rather than global
measurement, which is typically used in existing methods. The weights obtained by
our method are very robust in terms of degradation of noisy features, even those 
with vast dimensions. To demonstrate the performance of our method, extensive
experiments involving classification tests have been carried out on both
synthetic and real microarray benchmark datasets by combining the proposed
technique with standard classifiers, including the support vector machine (SVM), 
k-nearest neighbor (KNN), hyperplane k-nearest neighbor (HKNN), linear
discriminant analysis (LDA) and naive Bayes (NB).
CONCLUSION: Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the
superior performance of the proposed feature selection method combined with
supervised learning in three aspects: 1) high classification accuracy, 2)
excellent robustness to noise and 3) good stability using to various
classification algorithms.

PURPOSE: Accurate assessment of viability of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after
transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is important for therapy
planning. The purpose of this study is to determine the diagnostic value of a
novel image analysis method called parametric response mapping (PRM) in
predicting viability of tumor in HCC treated with TACE for dynamic CT images.
METHODS: 35 patients who had 35 iodized-oil defect areas (IODAs) in HCCs treated 
with TACE were included in our study. These patients were divided into two
groups, one group with viable tumors (n = 22) and the other group with non-viable
tumors (n = 13) in the IODA. All patients were followed up using triple-phase
dynamic CT after the treatment. We compared (a) manual analysis, (b) using PRM
results, and (c) using PRM results with automatic classifier to distinguish
between two tumor groups based on dynamic CT images from two longitudinal exams. 
Two radiologists performed the manual analysis. The PRM approach was implemented 
using prototype software. We adopted an off-the-shelf k nearest neighbor (kNN)
classifier and leave-one-out cross-validation for the third approach. The area
under the curve (AUC) values were compared for three approaches.
RESULTS: Manual analysis yielded AUC of 0.74, using PRM results yielded AUC of
0.84, and using PRM results with an automatic classifier yielded AUC of 0.87.
CONCLUSIONS: We improved upon the standard manual analysis approach by adopting a
novel image analysis method of PRM combined with an automatic classifier.

This study proposes a novel prediction approach for human breast and colon
cancers using different feature spaces. The proposed scheme consists of two
stages: the preprocessor and the predictor. In the preprocessor stage, the
mega-trend diffusion (MTD) technique is employed to increase the samples of the
minority class, thereby balancing the dataset. In the predictor stage,
machine-learning approaches of K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and support vector
machines (SVM) are used to develop hybrid MTD-SVM and MTD-KNN prediction models. 
MTD-SVM model has provided the best values of accuracy, G-mean and Matthew's
correlation coefficient of 96.71%, 96.70% and 71.98% for cancer/non-cancer
dataset, breast/non-breast cancer dataset and colon/non-colon cancer dataset,
respectively. We found that hybrid MTD-SVM is the best with respect to prediction
performance and computational cost. MTD-KNN model has achieved moderately better 
prediction as compared to hybrid MTD-NB (Naïve Bayes) but at the expense of
higher computing cost. MTD-KNN model is faster than MTD-RF (random forest) but
its prediction is not better than MTD-RF. To the best of our knowledge, the
reported results are the best results, so far, for these datasets. The proposed
scheme indicates that the developed models can be used as a tool for the
prediction of cancer. This scheme may be useful for study of any sequential
information such as protein sequence or any nucleic acid sequence.

Cervical cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death in females
worldwide. The disease can be cured if the patient is diagnosed in the
pre-cancerous lesion stage or earlier. A common physical examination technique
widely used in the screening is Papanicolaou test or Pap test. In this research, 
a method for automatic cervical cancer cell segmentation and classification is
proposed. A single-cell image is segmented into nucleus, cytoplasm, and
background, using the fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering technique. Four cell classes
in the ERUDIT and LCH datasets, i.e., normal, low grade squamous intraepithelial 
lesion (LSIL), high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), and squamous
cell carcinoma (SCC), are considered. The 2-class problem can be achieved by
grouping the last 3 classes as one abnormal class. Whereas, the Herlev dataset
consists of 7 cell classes, i.e., superficial squamous, intermediate squamous,
columnar, mild dysplasia, moderate dysplasia, severe dysplasia, and carcinoma in 
situ. These 7 classes can also be grouped to form a 2-class problem. These 3
datasets were tested on 5 classifiers including Bayesian classifier, linear
discriminant analysis (LDA), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), artificial neural networks
(ANN), and support vector machine (SVM). For the ERUDIT dataset, ANN with 5
nucleus-based features yielded the accuracies of 96.20% and 97.83% on the 4-class
and 2-class problems, respectively. For the Herlev dataset, ANN with 9 cell-based
features yielded the accuracies of 93.78% and 99.27% for the 7-class and 2-class 
problems, respectively. For the LCH dataset, ANN with 9 cell-based features
yielded the accuracies of 95.00% and 97.00% for the 4-class and 2-class problems,
respectively. The segmentation and classification performances of the proposed
method were compared with that of the hard C-means clustering and watershed
technique. The results show that the proposed automatic approach yields very good
performance and is better than its counterparts.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to identify biomarkers for estimating the overall
and prostate cancer (PCa)-specific survival in PCa patients at diagnosis.
METHODS: To explore the importance of embryonic stem cell (ESC) gene signatures, 
we identified 641 ESC gene predictors (ESCGPs) using published microarray data
sets. ESCGPs were selected in a stepwise manner, and were combined with reported 
genes. Selected genes were analyzed by multiplex quantitative polymerase chain
reaction using prostate fine-needle aspiration samples taken at diagnosis from a 
Swedish cohort of 189 PCa patients diagnosed between 1986 and 2001. Of these
patients, there was overall and PCa-specific survival data available for 97.9%,
and 77.9% were primarily treated by hormone therapy only. Univariate and
multivariate Cox proportional hazard ratios and Kaplan-Meier plots were used for 
the survival analysis, and a k-nearest neighbor (kNN) algorithm for estimating
overall survival.
RESULTS: An expression signature of VGLL3, IGFBP3 and F3 was shown sufficient to 
categorize the patients into high-, intermediate- and low-risk subtypes. The
median overall survival times of the subtypes were 3.23, 4.00 and 9.85 years,
respectively. The difference corresponded to hazard ratios of 5.86 (95%
confidence interval (CI): 2.91-11.78, P<0.001) for the high-risk subtype and 3.45
(95% CI: 1.79-6.66, P<0.001) for the intermediate-risk compared with the low-risk
subtype. The kNN models that included the gene expression signature outperformed 
the one designed on clinical parameters alone.
CONCLUSIONS: The expression signature can potentially be used to estimate overall
survival time. When validated in future studies, it could be integrated in the
routine clinical diagnostic and prognostic procedure of PCa for an optimal
treatment decision based on the estimated survival benefit.

IDM-PhyChm-Ens: intelligent decision-making ensemble methodology for
classification of human breast cancer using physicochemical properties of amino
acids.

Development of an accurate and reliable intelligent decision-making method for
the construction of cancer diagnosis system is one of the fast growing research
areas of health sciences. Such decision-making system can provide adequate
information for cancer diagnosis and drug discovery. Descriptors derived from
physicochemical properties of protein sequences are very useful for classifying
cancerous proteins. Recently, several interesting research studies have been
reported on breast cancer classification. To this end, we propose the
exploitation of the physicochemical properties of amino acids in protein primary 
sequences such as hydrophobicity (Hd) and hydrophilicity (Hb) for breast cancer
classification. Hd and Hb properties of amino acids, in recent literature, are
reported to be quite effective in characterizing the constituent amino acids and 
are used to study protein foldings, interactions, structures, and sequence-order 
effects. Especially, using these physicochemical properties, we observed that
proline, serine, tyrosine, cysteine, arginine, and asparagine amino acids offer
high discrimination between cancerous and healthy proteins. In addition, unlike
traditional ensemble classification approaches, the proposed 'IDM-PhyChm-Ens'
method was developed by combining the decision spaces of a specific classifier
trained on different feature spaces. The different feature spaces used were amino
acid composition, split amino acid composition, and pseudo amino acid
composition. Consequently, we have exploited different feature spaces using Hd
and Hb properties of amino acids to develop an accurate method for classification
of cancerous protein sequences. We developed ensemble classifiers using diverse
learning algorithms such as random forest (RF), support vector machines (SVM),
and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) trained on different feature spaces. We observed
that ensemble-RF, in case of cancer classification, performed better than
ensemble-SVM and ensemble-KNN. Our analysis demonstrates that ensemble-RF,
ensemble-SVM and ensemble-KNN are more effective than their individual
counterparts. The proposed 'IDM-PhyChm-Ens' method has shown improved performance
compared to existing techniques.

In this paper, we present a system based on feature extraction techniques and
image segmentation techniques for detecting and diagnosing abnormal patterns in
breast thermograms. The proposed system consists of three major steps: feature
extraction, classification into normal and abnormal pattern and segmentation of
abnormal pattern. Computed features based on gray-level co-occurrence matrices
are used to evaluate the effectiveness of textural information possessed by mass 
regions. A total of 20 GLCM features are extracted from thermograms. The ability 
of feature set in differentiating abnormal from normal tissue is investigated
using a Support Vector Machine classifier, Naive Bayes classifier and K-Nearest
Neighbor classifier. To evaluate the classification performance, five-fold cross 
validation method and Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed.
The verification results show that the proposed algorithm gives the best
classification results using K-Nearest Neighbor classifier and a accuracy of
92.5%. Image segmentation techniques can play an important role to segment and
extract suspected hot regions of interests in the breast infrared images. Three
image segmentation techniques: minimum variance quantization, dilation of image
and erosion of image are discussed. The hottest regions of thermal breast images 
are extracted and compared to the original images. According to the results, the 
proposed method has potential to extract almost exact shape of tumors.

Ovarian cancer is the fifth highest cause of cancer in women and the leading
cause of death from gynecological cancers. Accurate diagnosis of ovarian cancer
from acquired images is dependent on the expertise and experience of
ultrasonographers or physicians, and is therefore, associated with inter observer
variabilities. Computer Aided Diagnostic (CAD) techniques use a number of
different data mining techniques to automatically predict the presence or absence
of cancer, and therefore, are more reliable and accurate. A review of published
literature in the field of CAD based ovarian cancer detection indicates that many
studies use ultrasound images as the base for analysis. The key objective of this
work is to propose an effective adjunct CAD technique called GyneScan for ovarian
tumor detection in ultrasound images. In our proposed data mining framework, we
extract several texture features based on first order statistics, Gray Level
Co-occurrence Matrix and run length matrix. The significant features selected
using t-test are then used to train and test several supervised learning based
classifiers such as Probabilistic Neural Networks (PNN), Support Vector Machine
(SVM), Decision Tree (DT), k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Naive Bayes (NB). We
evaluated the developed framework using 1300 benign and 1300 malignant images.
Using 11 significant features in KNN/PNN classifiers, we were able to achieve
100% classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive
value in detecting ovarian tumor. Even though more validation using larger
databases would better establish the robustness of our technique, the preliminary
results are promising. This technique could be used as a reliable adjunct method 
to existing imaging modalities to provide a more confident second opinion on the 
presence/absence of ovarian tumor.

Introduction. The microarray datasets from the MicroArray Quality Control (MAQC) 
project have enabled the assessment of the precision, comparability of
microarrays, and other various microarray analysis methods. However, to date no
studies that we are aware of have reported the performance of missing value
imputation schemes on the MAQC datasets. In this study, we use the MAQC
Affymetrix datasets to evaluate several imputation procedures in Affymetrix
microarrays. Results. We evaluated several cutting edge imputation procedures and
compared them using different error measures. We randomly deleted 5% and 10% of
the data and imputed the missing values using imputation tests. We performed 1000
simulations and averaged the results. The results for both 5% and 10% deletion
are similar. Among the imputation methods, we observe the local least squares
method with k = 4 is most accurate under the error measures considered. The
k-nearest neighbor method with k = 1 has the highest error rate among imputation 
methods and error measures. Conclusions. We conclude for imputing missing values 
in Affymetrix microarray datasets, using the MAS 5.0 preprocessing scheme, the
local least squares method with k = 4 has the best overall performance and
k-nearest neighbor method with k = 1 has the worst overall performance. These
results hold true for both 5% and 10% missing values.

The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) has an important role in cell growth,
proliferation, and survival. mTOR is frequently hyperactivated in cancer, and
therefore, it is a clinically validated target for cancer therapy. In this study,
we combined exhaustive pharmacophore modeling and quantitative structure-activity
relationship (QSAR) analysis to explore the structural requirements for potent
mTOR inhibitors employing 210 known mTOR ligands. Genetic function algorithm
(GFA) coupled with k nearest neighbor (kNN) and multiple linear regression (MLR) 
analyses were employed to build self-consistent and predictive QSAR models based 
on optimal combinations of pharmacophores and physicochemical descriptors.
Successful pharmacophores were complemented with exclusion spheres to optimize
their receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) profiles. Optimal QSAR models
and their associated pharmacophore hypotheses were validated by identification
and experimental evaluation of several new promising mTOR inhibitory leads
retrieved from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) structural database. The most 
potent hit illustrated an IC50 value of 48 nM.

A novel method to classify multi-class biomedical objects is presented. The
method is based on a hybrid approach which combines pairwise comparison, Bayesian
regression and the k-nearest neighbor technique. It can be applied in a fully
automatic way or in a relevance feedback framework. In the latter case, the
information obtained from both an expert and the automatic classification is
iteratively used to improve the results until a certain accuracy level is
achieved, then, the learning process is finished and new classifications can be
automatically performed. The method has been applied in two biomedical contexts
by following the same cross-validation schemes as in the original studies. The
first one refers to cancer diagnosis, leading to an accuracy of 77.35% versus
66.37%, originally obtained. The second one considers the diagnosis of
pathologies of the vertebral column. The original method achieves accuracies
ranging from 76.5% to 96.7%, and from 82.3% to 97.1% in two different
cross-validation schemes. Even with no supervision, the proposed method reaches
96.71% and 97.32% in these two cases. By using a supervised framework the
achieved accuracy is 97.74%. Furthermore, all abnormal cases were correctly
classified.

Classifier-free, integrated genomic predictions of prostate cancer recurrence.

Shivade C(1), Chen JL.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Computer Science Engineering, The Ohio State University,
Columbus, OH.

Genomic predictions of clinical outcome are a core promise of the Human Genome
Project. Yet actionable biomarkers in clinical medicine are confounded by patient
heterogeneity as patient phenotypes are rarely well characterized and often
poorly understood. Furthermore, standard predictive algorithms rely on a priori
knowledge of discrete phenotypes for feature selection and training. To address
this limitation, we develop a classifier-free algorithm that matches individual
patients to other patient outcomes based on optimized clinicopathologic feature
integration and molecular pathway similarity using the K-nearest neighbor. By
identifying the best matches within the collection of patient data, we are able
to return the desired prediction. In prostate cancer, we demonstrate the
algorithm's ability to predict cancer recurrence without the need for supervised 
learning techniques in independent datasets with a recall and precision of 78%.
Importantly, the predictor is microarray platform independent, scalable and
simple to implement. Taken together, this method provides an exciting foundation 
from data-driven, clinical decision-making may arise.

PURPOSE: To determine the feasibility of texture analysis for the classification 
of gastric adenocarcinoma, lymphoma, and gastrointestinal stromal tumors on
contrast-enhanced hydrodynamic-MDCT images.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The arterial phase scans of 47 patients with
adenocarcinoma (AC) and a histologic tumor grade of [AC-G1, n=4, G1, n=4; AC-G2, 
n=7; AC-G3, n=16]; GIST, n=15; and lymphoma, n=5, and the venous phase scans of
48 patients with AC-G1, n=3; AC-G2, n=6; AC-G3, n=14; GIST, n=17; lymphoma, n=8, 
were retrospectively reviewed. Based on regions of interest, texture analysis was
performed, and features derived from the gray-level histogram, run-length and
co-occurrence matrix, absolute gradient, autoregressive model, and wavelet
transform were calculated. Fisher coefficients, probability of classification
error, average correlation coefficients, and mutual information coefficients were
used to create combinations of texture features that were optimized for tumor
differentiation. Linear discriminant analysis in combination with a k-nearest
neighbor classifier was used for tumor classification.
RESULTS: On arterial-phase scans, texture-based lesion classification was highly 
successful in differentiating between AC and lymphoma, and GIST and lymphoma,
with misclassification rates of 3.1% and 0%, respectively. On venous-phase scans,
texture-based classification was slightly less successful for AC vs. lymphoma
(9.7% misclassification) and GIST vs. lymphoma (8% misclassification), but
enabled the differentiation between AC and GIST (10% misclassification), and
between the different grades of AC (4.4% misclassification). No texture feature
combination was able to adequately distinguish between all three tumor types.
CONCLUSION: Classification of different gastric tumors based on textural
information may aid radiologists in establishing the correct diagnosis, at least 
in cases where the differential diagnosis can be narrowed down to two
histological subtypes.

Predict drug-protein interaction in cellular networking.

Involved with many diseases such as cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative,
inflammatory and respiratory disorders, GPCRs (G-protein-coupled receptors) are
the most frequent targets for drug development: over 50% of all prescription
drugs currently on the market are actually acting by targeting GPCRs directly or 
indirectly. Found in every living thing and nearly all cells, ion channels play
crucial roles for many vital functions in life, such as heartbeat, sensory
transduction, and central nervous system response. Their dysfunction may have
significant impact to human health, and hence ion channels are deemed as "the
next GPCRs". To develop GPCR-targeting or ion-channel-targeting drugs, the first 
important step is to identify the interactions between potential drug compounds
with the two kinds of protein receptors in the cellular networking. In this
minireview, we are to introduce two predictors. One is called iGPCR-Drug
accessible at http://www.jci-bioinfo.cn/iGPCR-Drug/; the other called iCDI-PseFpt
at http://www.jci-bioinfo.cn/iCDI-PseFpt. The former is for identifying the
interactions of drug compounds with GPCRs; while the latter for that with ion
channels. In both predictors, the drug compound was formulated by the
two-dimensional molecular fingerprint, and the protein receptor by the pseudo
amino acid composition generated with the grey model theory, while the operation 
engine was the fuzzy K-nearest neighbor algorithm. For the convenience of most
experimental pharmaceutical and medical scientists, a step-bystep guide is
provided on how to use each of the two web-servers to get the desired results
without the need to follow the complicated mathematics involved originally for
their establishment.

The purpose was to investigate the contribution of machine learning algorithms
using diffusion and perfusion techniques in the differentiation of atypical
meningiomas from glioblastomas and metastases. Apparent diffusion coefficient,
fractional anisotropy, and relative cerebral blood volume were measured in
different tumor regions. Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbor, and Support Vector
Machine classifiers were used in the classification procedure. The application of
classification methods adds incremental differential diagnostic value.
Differentiation is mainly achieved using diffusion metrics, while perfusion
measurements may provide significant information for the peritumoral regions.

Classification of cancer based on gene expression has provided insight into
possible treatment strategies. Thus, developing machine learning methods that can
successfully distinguish among cancer subtypes or normal versus cancer samples is
important. This work discusses supervised learning techniques that have been
employed to classify cancers. Furthermore, a two-step feature selection method
based on an attribute estimation method (e.g., ReliefF) and a genetic algorithm
was employed to find a set of genes that can best differentiate between cancer
subtypes or normal versus cancer samples. The application of different
classification methods (e.g., decision tree, k-nearest neighbor, support vector
machine (SVM), bagging, and random forest) on 5 cancer datasets shows that no
classification method universally outperforms all the others. However, k-nearest 
neighbor and linear SVM generally improve the classification performance over
other classifiers. Finally, incorporating diverse types of genomic data (e.g.,
protein-protein interaction data and gene expression) increase the prediction
accuracy as compared to using gene expression alone.

Block-diagonal discriminant analysis and its bias-corrected rules.

Pang H(1), Tong T, Ng M.

Medicine, Durham, NC 27710, USA.

High-throughput expression profiling allows simultaneous measure of tens of
thousands of genes at once. These data have motivated the development of reliable
biomarkers for disease subtypes identification and diagnosis. Many methods have
been developed in the literature for analyzing these data, such as diagonal
discriminant analysis, support vector machines, and k-nearest neighbor methods.
The diagonal discriminant methods have been shown to perform well for
high-dimensional data with small sample sizes. Despite its popularity, the
independence assumption is unlikely to be true in practice. Recently, a gene
module based linear discriminant analysis strategy has been proposed by utilizing
the correlation among genes in discriminant analysis. However, the approach can
be underpowered when the samples of the two classes are unbalanced. In this
paper, we propose to correct the biases in the discriminant scores of
block-diagonal discriminant analysis. In simulation studies, our proposed method 
outperforms other approaches in various settings. We also illustrate our proposed
discriminant analysis method for analyzing microarray data studies.

Lung cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer resulting in over a million
deaths per year worldwide. In this paper, the usage of support vector machine
(SVM) classification for lung cancer is investigated, presenting a systematic
quantitative evaluation against Boosting, Decision trees, k-nearest neighbor,
LASSO regressions, neural networks and random forests. A large database of 5984
regions of interest (ROIs) and 488 input features (including textural features,
patient characteristics, and morphological features) were used to train the
classifiers and evaluate for their performance. The evaluation for classifiers'
performance was based on a tenfold cross validation framework, receiver operating
characteristic curve (ROC), and Matthews correlation coefficient. Area under
curve (AUC) of SVM, Boosting, Decision trees, k-nearest neighbor, LASSO, neural
networks, random forests were 0.94, 0.86, 0.73, 0.72, 0.91, 0.92, and 0.85,
respectively. It was proved that SVM classification offered significantly
increased classification performance compared to the reference methods. This
scheme may be used as an auxiliary tool to differentiate between benign and
malignant SPNs of CT images in future.

Neuroradiology and Musculoskeletal Radiology, Vienna, Austria.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether texture-based analysis of
standard MRI sequences and diffusion-weighted imaging can help in the
discrimination of parotid gland masses. The MR images of 38 patients with a
biopsy- or surgery-proven parotid gland mass were retrospectively analyzed. All
patients were examined on the same 3.0 Tesla MR unit, with one standard protocol.
The ADC (apparent diffusion coefficient) values of the tumors were measured with 
three regions of interest (ROIs) covering the entire tumor. Texture-based
analysis was performed with the texture analysis software MaZda (version 4.7),
with ROI measurements covering the entire tumor in three slices. COC
(co-occurrence matrix), RUN (run-length matrix), GRA (gradient), ARM
(auto-regressive model), and WAV (wavelet transform) features were calculated for
all ROIs. Three subsets of 10 texture features each were used for a linear
discriminant analysis (LDA) in combination with k nearest neighbor classification
(k-NN). Using histology as a standard of reference, benign tumors, including
subtypes, and malignant tumors were compared with regard to ADC and texture-based
values, with a one-way analysis of variance with post-hoc t-tests. Significant
differences were found in the mean ADC values between Warthin tumors and
pleomorphic adenomas, as well as between Warthin tumors and benign lesions.
Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images contained the most relevant textural
information for the discrimination between benign and malignant parotid masses,
and also for the discrimination between pleomorphic adenomas and Warthin tumors. 
STIR images contained the least relevant texture features, particularly for the
discrimination between pleomorphic adenomas and Warthin tumors. Texture analysis 
proved to differentiate benign from malignant lesions, as well as pleomorphic
adenomas from Warthin tumors, based on standard T(1w) sequences (without and with
contrast). Of all benign parotid masses, Warthin tumors had significantly lower
ADC values than the other entities.

Computer-aided diagnosis system for classifying benign and malignant thyroid
nodules in multi-stained FNAB cytological images.

Engineering, Coimbatore, India. gopiphd@yahoo.com

An automated computer-aided diagnosis system is developed to classify benign and 
malignant thyroid nodules using multi-stained fine needle aspiration biopsy
(FNAB) cytological images. In the first phase, the image segmentation is
performed to remove the background staining information and retain the
appropriate foreground cell objects in cytological images using mathematical
morphology and watershed transform segmentation methods. Subsequently,
statistical features are extracted using two-level discrete wavelet transform
(DWT) decomposition, gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) and Gabor filter
based methods. The classifiers k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), Elman neural network
(ENN) and support vector machine (SVM) are tested for classifying benign and
malignant thyroid nodules. The combination of watershed segmentation, GLCM
features and k-NN classifier results a lowest diagnostic accuracy of 60 %. The
highest diagnostic accuracy of 93.33 % is achieved by ENN classifier trained with
the statistical features extracted by Gabor filter bank from the images segmented
by morphology and watershed transform segmentation methods. It is also observed
that SVM classifier results its highest diagnostic accuracy of 90 % for DWT and
Gabor filter based features along with morphology and watershed transform
segmentation methods. The experimental results suggest that the developed system 
with multi-stained thyroid FNAB images would be useful for identifying thyroid
cancer irrespective of staining protocol used.

Improving the classification accuracy for IR spectroscopic diagnosis of stomach
and colon malignancy using non-linear spectral feature extraction methods.

Non-linear feature extraction methods, neighborhood preserving embedding (NPE)
and supervised NPE (SNPE), were employed to effectively represent the IR spectral
features of stomach and colon biopsy tissues for classification, and improve the 
classification accuracy for diagnosis of malignancy. The motivation was to
utilize the NPE and SNPE's capability of capturing non-linear spectral behaviors 
by simultaneously preserving local relationships in order that minute spectral
differences among classes would be effectively recognized. NPE and SNPE derive an
optimal embedding feature such that the local neighborhood structure can be
preserved in reduced spaces (variables). The IR spectra collected from stomach
and colon tissues were represented by several new variables through NPE and SNPE,
and also by using the principal component analysis (PCA). Then, the
feature-extracted variables were subsequently classified into normal, adenoma and
cancer tissues by using both k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) and support vector machine
(SVM), and the resulting accuracies were compared with each other. In both cases,
the combination of SNPE-SVM provided the best classification performance, and the
accuracy was substantially improved compared to when PCA-SVM was used. Overall
results demonstrate that NPE and SNPE could be potential feature-representation
strategies useful in biomedical diagnosis based on vibrational spectroscopy where
effective recognition of minute spectral differences is critical.

profiles.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a cancer of antibody-making plasma cells. It frequently 
harbors alterations in DNA and chromosome copy numbers, and can be divided into
two major subtypes, hyperdiploid (HMM) and non-hyperdiploid multiple myeloma
(NHMM). The two subtypes have different survival prognosis, possibly due to
different but converging paths to oncogenesis. Existing methods for identifying
the two subtypes are fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and copy number
microarrays, with increased cost and sample requirements. We hypothesize that
chromosome alterations have their imprint in gene expression through dosage
effect. Using five MM expression datasets that have HMM status measured by FISH
and copy number microarrays, we have developed and validated a K-nearest-neighbor
method to classify MM into HMM and NHMM based on gene expression profiles.
Classification accuracy for test datasets ranges from 0.83 to 0.88. This
classification will enable researchers to study differences and commonalities of 
the two MM subtypes in disease biology and prognosis using expression datasets
without need for additional subtype measurements. Our study also supports the
advantages of using cancer specific characteristics in feature design and pooling
multiple rounds of classification results to improve accuracy. We provide R
source code and processed datasets at www.ChengLiLab.org/software.

The aim of this work was a comprehensive analysis of metabolite profiles of
nucleosides from biological samples obtained from patients with urogenital cancer
disease as well as an interpretation of cancer-related patterns of the analyzed
profiles. In our study we proposed a targeted approach that was focused on the
simultaneous determination of twelve nucleosides from over a hundred urine
samples. For analytes' quantification high performance liquid chromatography
technique hyphenated with tripple quadrupole mass spectrometer was applied. The
developed method was validated in terms of linearity, precision, accuracy as well
as in terms of limit of quantification and limit of detection. The obtained,
normalized data set was analyzed using univariate statistical analysis. The
achieved results revealed statistically significant (p<0.05) differences between 
levels of five nucleosides determined in urine samples from cancer patients and
healthy volunteers, namely: 6-methyladenosine, inosine, N-2-methylguanosine,
3-methyluridine and N,N-dimethylguanosine. Basing on the putative markers we
built the discrimination models using partial least squares discriminant analysis
as well as K-nearest neighbor method. The sensitivity and specificity of the
markers calculated from the obtained models were in the range of 61.9-88.89% and 
27.78-50%, respectively. The proposed procedure can be considered as a holistic
approach for metabolites' analysis and includes clinical, analytical and
bioinformatics sections.

in 3D contrast-enhanced ultrasound.

In this work, we present a Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) based technique for
automatic classification of benign and malignant thyroid lesions in 3D
contrast-enhanced ultrasound images. The images were obtained from 20 patients.
Fine needle aspiration biopsy and histology confirmed malignancy. Discrete
Wavelet Transform (DWT) and texture based features were extracted from the
thyroid images. The resulting feature vectors were used to train and test three
different classifiers: K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN), Probabilistic Neural Network
(PNN), and Decision Tree (DeTr) using ten-fold cross validation technique. Our
results show that combination of DWT and texture features in the K-NN classifier 
resulted in a classification accuracy of 98.9%, a sensitivity of 98%, and a
specificity of 99.8%. Thus, the preliminary results of the proposed technique
show that it could be adapted as an adjunct tool that can give valuable second
opinions to the doctors regarding the nature of the thyroid nodule. The technique
is cost-effective, non-invasive, fast, completely automated and gives more
objective and reproducible results compared to manual analysis of the ultrasound 
images. We however intend to establish the clinical applicability of this
technique by evaluating it with more data in the future.

Accurate tumor, node, and metastasis (TNM) staging, especially N staging in
gastric cancer or the metastasis on lymph node diagnosis, is a popular issue in
clinical medical image analysis in which gemstone spectral imaging (GSI) can
provide more information to doctors than conventional computed tomography (CT)
does. In this paper, we apply machine learning methods on the GSI analysis of
lymph node metastasis in gastric cancer. First, we use some feature selection or 
metric learning methods to reduce data dimension and feature space. We then
employ the K-nearest neighbor classifier to distinguish lymph node metastasis
from nonlymph node metastasis. The experiment involved 38 lymph node samples in
gastric cancer, showing an overall accuracy of 96.33%. Compared with that of
traditional diagnostic methods, such as helical CT (sensitivity 75.2% and
specificity 41.8%) and multidetector computed tomography (82.09%), the diagnostic
accuracy of lymph node metastasis is high. GSI-CT can then be the optimal choice 
for the preoperative diagnosis of patients with gastric cancer in the N staging.

AIM: To support probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE) diagnosis by
designing software for the automated classification of colonic polyps.
METHODS: Intravenous fluorescein pCLE imaging of colorectal lesions was performed
on patients undergoing screening and surveillance colonoscopies, followed by
polypectomies. All resected specimens were reviewed by a reference
gastrointestinal pathologist blinded to pCLE information. Histopathology was used
as the criterion standard for the differentiation between neoplastic and
non-neoplastic lesions. The pCLE video sequences, recorded for each polyp, were
analyzed off-line by 2 expert endoscopists who were blinded to the endoscopic
characteristics and histopathology. These pCLE videos, along with their
histopathology diagnosis, were used to train the automated classification
software which is a content-based image retrieval technique followed by k-nearest
neighbor classification. The performance of the off-line diagnosis of pCLE videos
established by the 2 expert endoscopists was compared with that of automated pCLE
software classification. All evaluations were performed using
leave-one-patient-out cross-validation to avoid bias.
RESULTS: Colorectal lesions (135) were imaged in 71 patients. Based on
histopathology, 93 of these 135 lesions were neoplastic and 42 were
non-neoplastic. The study found no statistical significance for the difference
between the performance of automated pCLE software classification (accuracy
89.6%, sensitivity 92.5%, specificity 83.3%, using leave-one-patient-out
cross-validation) and the performance of the off-line diagnosis of pCLE videos
established by the 2 expert endoscopists (accuracy 89.6%, sensitivity 91.4%,
specificity 85.7%). There was very low power (< 6%) to detect the observed
differences. The 95% confidence intervals for equivalence testing were: -0.073 to
0.073 for accuracy, -0.068 to 0.089 for sensitivity and -0.18 to 0.13 for
specificity. The classification software proposed in this study is not a "black
box" but an informative tool based on the query by example model that produces,
as intermediate results, visually similar annotated videos that are directly
interpretable by the endoscopist.
CONCLUSION: The proposed software for automated classification of pCLE videos of 
colonic polyps achieves high performance, comparable to that of off-line
diagnosis of pCLE videos established by expert endoscopists.

The top-scoring 'N' algorithm: a generalized relative expression classification
method from small numbers of biomolecules.

Magis AT(1), Price ND.

Author information: 
(1)Institute for Systems Biology, Seattle, WA 98109, USA.

BACKGROUND: Relative expression algorithms such as the top-scoring pair (TSP) and
the top-scoring triplet (TST) have several strengths that distinguish them from
other classification methods, including resistance to overfitting, invariance to 
most data normalization methods, and biological interpretability. The top-scoring
'N' (TSN) algorithm is a generalized form of other relative expression algorithms
which uses generic permutations and a dynamic classifier size to control both the
permutation and combination space available for classification.
RESULTS: TSN was tested on nine cancer datasets, showing statistically
significant differences in classification accuracy between different classifier
sizes (choices of N). TSN also performed competitively against a wide variety of 
different classification methods, including artificial neural networks,
classification trees, discriminant analysis, k-Nearest neighbor, naïve Bayes, and
support vector machines, when tested on the Microarray Quality Control II
datasets. Furthermore, TSN exhibits low levels of overfitting on training data
compared to other methods, giving confidence that results obtained during cross
validation will be more generally applicable to external validation sets.
CONCLUSIONS: TSN preserves the strengths of other relative expression algorithms 
while allowing a much larger permutation and combination space to be explored,
potentially improving classification accuracies when fewer numbers of measured
features are available.

False positive (FP) marks represent an obstacle for effective use of
computer-aided detection (CADe) of breast masses in mammography. Typically, the
problem can be approached either by developing more discriminative features or by
employing different classifier designs. In this paper, the usage of support
vector machine (SVM) classification for FP reduction in CADe is investigated,
presenting a systematic quantitative evaluation against neural networks,
k-nearest neighbor classification, linear discriminant analysis and random
forests. A large database of 2516 film mammography examinations and 73 input
features was used to train the classifiers and evaluate for their performance on 
correctly diagnosed exams as well as false negatives. Further, classifier
robustness was investigated using varying training data and feature sets as
input. The evaluation was based on the mean exam sensitivity in 0.05-1 FPs on
normals on the free-response receiver operating characteristic curve (FROC),
incorporated into a tenfold cross validation framework. It was found that SVM
classification using a Gaussian kernel offered significantly increased detection 
performance (P = 0.0002) compared to the reference methods. Varying training data
and input features, SVMs showed improved exploitation of large feature sets. It
is concluded that with the SVM-based CADe a significant reduction of FPs is
possible outperforming other state-of-the-art approaches for breast mass CADe.

Microcalcifications are an early mammographic sign of breast cancer and a target 
for stereotactic breast needle biopsy. Here, we develop and compare different
approaches for developing Raman classification algorithms to diagnose invasive
and in situ breast cancer, fibrocystic change and fibroadenoma that can be
associated with microcalcifications. In this study, Raman spectra were acquired
from tissue cores obtained from fresh breast biopsies and analyzed using a
constituent-based breast model. Diagnostic algorithms based on the breast model
fit coefficients were devised using logistic regression, C4.5 decision tree
classification, k-nearest neighbor (k -NN) and support vector machine (SVM)
analysis, and subjected to leave-one-out cross validation. The best performing
algorithm was based on SVM analysis (with radial basis function), which yielded a
positive predictive value of 100% and negative predictive value of 96% for cancer
diagnosis. Importantly, these results demonstrate that Raman spectroscopy
provides adequate diagnostic information for lesion discrimination even in the
presence of microcalcifications, which to the best of our knowledge has not been 
previously reported.

BACKGROUND: Cancers of unknown primary origin (CUP) constitute 3%-5% (50,000 to
70,000 cases) of all newly diagnosed cancers per year in the United States.
Including cancers of uncertain primary origin, the total number increases to
12%-15% (180,000 to 220,000 cases) of all newly diagnosed cancers per year in the
United States. Cancers of unknown/uncertain primary origins present major
diagnostic and clinical challenges because the tumor tissue of origin is crucial 
for selecting optimal treatment. MicroRNAs are a family of noncoding, regulatory 
RNA genes involved in carcinogenesis. MicroRNAs that are highly stable in
clinical samples and tissue specific serve as ideal biomarkers for cancer
diagnosis. Our first-generation assay identified the tumor of origin based on 48 
microRNAs measured on a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction platform
and differentiated 25 tumor types.
METHODS: We present here the development and validation of a second-generation
assay that identifies 42 tumor types using a custom microarray. A combination of 
a binary decision-tree and a k-nearest-neighbor classifier was developed to
identify the tumor of origin based on the expression of 64 microRNAs.
RESULTS: Overall assay sensitivity (positive agreement), measured blindly on a
validation set of 509 independent samples, was 85%. The sensitivity reached 90%
for cases in which the assay reported a single answer (>80% of cases). A clinical
validation study on 52 true CUP patients showed 88% concordance with the
clinicopathological evaluation of the patients.
CONCLUSION: The abilities of the assay to identify 42 tumor types with high

Efficient feature selection and multiclass classification with integrated
instance and model based learning.

Multiclass classification and feature (variable) selections are commonly
encountered in many biological and medical applications. However, extending
binary classification approaches to multiclass problems is not trivial.
Instance-based methods such as the K nearest neighbor (KNN) can naturally extend 
to multiclass problems and usually perform well with unbalanced data, but suffer 
from the curse of dimensionality. Their performance is degraded when applied to
high dimensional data. On the other hand, model-based methods such as logistic
regression require the decomposition of the multiclass problem into several
binary problems with one-vs.-one or one-vs.-rest schemes. Even though they can be
applied to high dimensional data with L(1) or L(p) penalized methods, such
approaches can only select independent features and the features selected with
different binary problems are usually different. They also produce unbalanced
classification problems with one vs. the rest scheme even if the original
multiclass problem is balanced.By combining instance-based and model-based
learning, we propose an efficient learning method with integrated KNN and
constrained logistic regression (KNNLog) for simultaneous multiclass
classification and feature selection. Our proposed method simultaneously
minimizes the intra-class distance and maximizes the interclass distance with
fewer estimated parameters. It is very efficient for problems with small sample
size and unbalanced classes, a case common in many real applications. In
addition, our model-based feature selection methods can identify highly
correlated features simultaneously avoiding the multiplicity problem due to
multiple tests. The proposed method is evaluated with simulation and real data
including one unbalanced microRNA dataset for leukemia and one multiclass
metagenomic dataset from the Human Microbiome Project (HMP). It performs well
with limited computational experiments.

An important application of microarray data in functional genomics is to classify
samples according to their gene expression profiles such as to classify cancer
versus normal samples or to classify different types or subtypes of cancer. One
of the major tasks with gene expression data is to find co-regulated gene groups 
whose collective expression is strongly associated with sample categories. In
this regard, a gene clustering algorithm is proposed to group genes from
microarray data. It directly incorporates the information of sample categories in
the grouping process for finding groups of co-regulated genes with strong
association to the sample categories, yielding a supervised gene clustering
algorithm. The average expression of the genes from each cluster acts as its
representative. Some significant representatives are taken to form the reduced
feature set to build the classifiers for cancer classification. The mutual
information is used to compute both gene-gene redundancy and gene-class
relevance. The performance of the proposed method, along with a comparison with
existing methods, is studied on six cancer microarray data sets using the
predictive accuracy of naive Bayes classifier, K-nearest neighbor rule, and
support vector machine. An important finding is that the proposed algorithm is
shown to be effective for identifying biologically significant gene clusters with
excellent predictive capability.

The Jacquez k nearest neighbor test, originally developed to improve upon
shortcomings of existing tests for space-time interaction, has been shown to be a
robust and powerful method of detecting interaction. Despite its flexibility and 
power, however, the test has three main shortcomings: (i) it discards important
information regarding the spatial and temporal scales at which the detected
interaction takes place; (ii) the results of the test have not been visualized;
and (iii) recent research demonstrates the test to be susceptible to population
shift bias. This study presents enhancements to the Jacquez k nearest neighbors
test with the goal of addressing each of these three shortcomings and of
improving the utility of the test. Data on Burkitt's lymphoma cases in Uganda
between 1961 and 1975 are used to illustrate the modifications and enhanced
visual output of the test. Output from the enhanced test is compared with that
provided by alternative tests of space-time interaction. Results show the
enhancements presented in this study transform the Jacquez test into a complete, 
descriptive, and informative metric that can be used as a stand-alone measure of 
global space-time interaction.

Evaluating feature selection strategies for high dimensional, small sample size
datasets.

Golugula A(1), Lee G, Madabhushi A.

(1)Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rutgers University,
Piscataway, New Jersey 08854, USA.

In this work, we analyze and evaluate different strategies for comparing Feature 
Selection (FS) schemes on High Dimensional (HD) biomedical datasets (e.g. gene
and protein expression studies) with a small sample size (SSS). Additionally, we 
define a new feature, Robustness, specifically for comparing the ability of an FS
scheme to be invariant to changes in its training data. While classifier accuracy
has been the de facto method for evaluating FS schemes, on account of the curse
of dimensionality problem, it might not always be the appropriate measure for
HD/SSS datasets. SSS lends the dataset a higher probability of containing data
that is not representative of the true distribution of the whole population.
However, an ideal FS scheme must be robust enough to produce the same results
each time there are changes to the training data. In this study, we employed the 
robustness performance measure in conjunction with classifier accuracy (measured 
via the K-Nearest Neighbor and Random Forest classifiers) to quantitatively
compare five different FS schemes (T-test, F-test, Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test, Wilks
Lambda Test and Wilcoxon Rand Sum Test) on 5 HD/SSS gene and protein expression
datasets corresponding to ovarian cancer, lung cancer, bone lesions, celiac
disease, and coronary heart disease. Of the five FS schemes compared, the
Wilcoxon Rand Sum Test was found to outperform other FS schemes in terms of
classification accuracy and robustness. Our results suggest that both classifier 
accuracy and robustness should be considered when deciding on the appropriate FS 
scheme for HD/SSS datasets.

Peripheral blood genes expressions profiling (GeXP) have been convinced to be
more specific for the diagnosis of cancer and other diseases, and the GeXP system
provides an ideal method to analyze multiple genes expression in one normalized
and equable system. We aim to differentiate hepatocellular carcinoma from other
hepatic diseases based on peripheral blood and the GeXP system. Fifteen selected 
hepatic diseases related genes with two house-keeping genes for normalization
were detected by the GeXP system. The diagnosis model was based on K nearest
neighbor classifier and cross validation, and software based on MATLAB software
was built for differential diagnosis of hepatic diseases. Eight hepatic related
genes were demonstrated to show an obvious statistic difference in expressions
while the K nearest neighbors classifier showed that the accuracy for normal
controls, hepatitis B, liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and the Other
group was separately 80.57 %, 78.17 %, 84.48 %, 73.24 % and 85.85 %. The set of
validation has been carried out to assess the accuracy of Model Two and the
accuracy was even higher than the set of building for the model, except for the
hepatitis B (HBV) group. A sensitive and specific GeXP system of eight genes has 
been developed for the accurate differential diagnosis of hepatic disease.

Ultrasound-based thyroid nodule characterization into benign and malignant types 
is limited by subjective interpretations. This paper presents a Computer Aided
Diagnostic (CAD) technique that would present more objective and accurate
classification and further would offer the physician a valuable second opinion.
In this paradigm, we first extracted the features that quantify the local changes
in the texture characteristics of the ultrasound off-line training images from
both benign and malignant nodules. These features include: Fractal Dimension
(FD), Local Binary Pattern (LBP), Fourier Spectrum Descriptor (FS), and Laws
Texture Energy (LTE). The resulting feature vectors were used to build seven
different classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Sugeno
Fuzzy, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Radial Basis
Probabilistic Neural Network (RBPNN), and Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC).
Subsequently, the feature vector-classifier combination that results in the
maximum classification accuracy was used to predict the class of a new on-line
test thyroid ultrasound image. Two data sets with 3D Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound
(CEUS) and 3D High Resolution Ultrasound (HRUS) images of 20 nodules (10 benign
and 10 malignant) were used. Fine needle aspiration biopsy and histology results 
were used to confirm malignancy. Our results show that a combination of texture
features coupled with SVM or Fuzzy classifiers resulted in 100% accuracy for the 
HRUS dataset, while GMM classifier resulted in 98.1% accuracy for the CEUS
dataset. Finally, for each dataset, we have proposed a novel integrated index
called Thyroid Malignancy Index (TMI) using the combination of FD, LBP, LTE
texture features, to diagnose benign or malignant nodules. This index can help
clinicians to make a more objective differentiation of benign/malignant thyroid
lesions. We have compared and benchmarked the system with existing methods.

Health, Rockville, MD 20852, USA. xiaosheng.wang@nih.gov

Two-gene classifiers have attracted a broad interest for their simplicity and
practicality. Most existing two-gene classification algorithms were involved in
exhaustive search that led to their low time-efficiencies. In this study, we
proposed two new two-gene classification algorithms which used simple univariate 
gene selection strategy and constructed simple classification rules based on
optimal cut-points for two genes selected. We detected the optimal cut-point with
the information entropy principle. We applied the two-gene classification models 
to eleven cancer gene expression datasets and compared their classification
performance to that of some established two-gene classification models like the
top-scoring pairs model and the greedy pairs model, as well as standard methods
including Diagonal Linear Discriminant Analysis, k-Nearest Neighbor, Support
Vector Machine and Random Forest. These comparisons indicated that the
performance of our two-gene classifiers was comparable to or better than that of 
compared models.

Random KNN feature selection - a fast and stable alternative to Random Forests.

Li S(1), Harner EJ, Adjeroh DA.

Author information: 
(1)The Department of Statistics, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV 26506, 
USA.

BACKGROUND: Successfully modeling high-dimensional data involving thousands of
variables is challenging. This is especially true for gene expression profiling
experiments, given the large number of genes involved and the small number of
samples available. Random Forests (RF) is a popular and widely used approach to
feature selection for such "small n, large p problems." However, Random Forests
suffers from instability, especially in the presence of noisy and/or unbalanced
inputs.
RESULTS: We present RKNN-FS, an innovative feature selection procedure for "small
n, large p problems." RKNN-FS is based on Random KNN (RKNN), a novel
generalization of traditional nearest-neighbor modeling. RKNN consists of an
ensemble of base k-nearest neighbor models, each constructed from a random subset
of the input variables. To rank the importance of the variables, we define a
criterion on the RKNN framework, using the notion of support. A two-stage
backward model selection method is then developed based on this criterion.
Empirical results on microarray data sets with thousands of variables and
relatively few samples show that RKNN-FS is an effective feature selection
approach for high-dimensional data. RKNN is similar to Random Forests in terms of
classification accuracy without feature selection. However, RKNN provides much
better classification accuracy than RF when each method incorporates a
feature-selection step. Our results show that RKNN is significantly more stable
and more robust than Random Forests for feature selection when the input data are
noisy and/or unbalanced. Further, RKNN-FS is much faster than the Random Forests 
feature selection method (RF-FS), especially for large scale problems, involving 
thousands of variables and multiple classes.
CONCLUSIONS: Given the superiority of Random KNN in classification performance
when compared with Random Forests, RKNN-FS's simplicity and ease of
implementation, and its superiority in speed and stability, we propose RKNN-FS as
a faster and more stable alternative to Random Forests in classification problems
involving feature selection for high-dimensional datasets.

mammographic mass using ensemble classifier.

RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Accurate classification is critical in mammography
computer-aided diagnosis using content-based image retrieval approaches (CBIR
CAD). The objectives of this study were to: 1) develop an accurate ensemble
classifier based on domain knowledge and a robust feature selection method for
CBIR CAD; 2) propose three new features; and 3) assess the performance of the
proposed method and new features by using a relatively large imaging data set.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The data set used in this study consisted of 2114 regions 
of interest (ROI) extracted from a publicly available image database. The
proposed ensemble classifier method we called E-DGA-KNN included four steps. In
the first step, 804 ROIs depict masses were divided into five classes according
to their boundary types. Then, each class of ROI with an equal number of negative
ROIs were put together to create a sub-database. Second, a dual-stage genetic
algorithm, which was called DGA, was applied on those five sub-databases for
feature selection and weights determination respectively. In the third step, five
base K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifiers were created by using the results of
the second step on 2114 ROIs, and five detection scores for a given queried ROI
were obtained. Finally, these classifiers are combined to yield a final
classification. The performances of the proposed methods were evaluated by using 
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. A comparison with eight
different methods on the data set was provided which include the stepwise linear 
discriminative analysis algorithm (SLDA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO)
algorithm with KNN classifier.
RESULTS: When four hybrid feature selection methods were applied with single KNN 
classifier (ie, DGA-KNN, SLDA-WGA-KNN, SLDA-PSO-KNN, GA-PSO-KNN) and the proposed
E-DGA-KNN method to the data set, the computed areas under the ROC curve (Az)
were 0.8782 ± 0.0080, 0.8675 ± 0.0081, 0.8623 ± 0.0083, 0.8725 ± 0.0079, and
0.8927 ± 0.0073, respectively. If all features and single KNN classifier were
used, the Az value was 0.8478 ± 0.0088. Az values were 0.8592 ± 0.0083 and 0.8632
± 0.0081 when SLDA or GA algorithm used alone.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, an ensemble classifier based on domain knowledge and 
a dual-stage feature selection method was proposed. Evaluation results indicated 
that the proposed method achieved largest value of ROC compared to other
algorithms. The proposed method shows better performance and has the potential to
improve the performance of CBIR CAD in interpreting and analyzing mammograms.

Oral cancer (OC) is the sixth most common cancer in the world. In India it is the
most common malignant neoplasm. Histopathological images have widely been used in
the differential diagnosis of normal, oral precancerous (oral sub-mucous fibrosis
(OSF)) and cancer lesions. However, this technique is limited by subjective
interpretations and less accurate diagnosis. The objective of this work is to
improve the classification accuracy based on textural features in the development
of a computer assisted screening of OSF. The approach introduced here is to grade
the histopathological tissue sections into normal, OSF without Dysplasia (OSFWD) 
and OSF with Dysplasia (OSFD), which would help the oral onco-pathologists to
screen the subjects rapidly. The biopsy sections are stained with H&E. The
optical density of the pixels in the light microscopic images is recorded and
represented as matrix quantized as integers from 0 to 255 for each fundamental
color (Red, Green, Blue), resulting in a M×N×3 matrix of integers. Depending on
either normal or OSF condition, the image has various granular structures which
are self similar patterns at different scales termed "texture". We have extracted
these textural changes using Higher Order Spectra (HOS), Local Binary Pattern
(LBP), and Laws Texture Energy (LTE) from the histopathological images (normal,
OSFWD and OSFD). These feature vectors were fed to five different classifiers:
Decision Tree (DT), Sugeno Fuzzy, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), K-Nearest
Neighbor (K-NN), Radial Basis Probabilistic Neural Network (RBPNN) to select the 
best classifier. Our results show that combination of texture and HOS features
coupled with Fuzzy classifier resulted in 95.7% accuracy, sensitivity and
specificity of 94.5% and 98.8% respectively. Finally, we have proposed a novel
integrated index called Oral Malignancy Index (OMI) using the HOS, LBP, LTE
features, to diagnose benign or malignant tissues using just one number. We hope 
that this OMI can help the clinicians in making a faster and more objective
detection of benign/malignant oral lesions.

Replication timing: a fingerprint for cell identity and pluripotency.

Many types of epigenetic profiling have been used to classify stem cells, stages 
of cellular differentiation, and cancer subtypes. Existing methods focus on local
chromatin features such as DNA methylation and histone modifications that require
extensive analysis for genome-wide coverage. Replication timing has emerged as a 
highly stable cell type-specific epigenetic feature that is regulated at the
megabase-level and is easily and comprehensively analyzed genome-wide. Here, we
describe a cell classification method using 67 individual replication profiles
from 34 mouse and human cell lines and stem cell-derived tissues, including new
data for mesendoderm, definitive endoderm, mesoderm and smooth muscle. Using a
Monte-Carlo approach for selecting features of replication profiles conserved in 
each cell type, we identify "replication timing fingerprints" unique to each cell
type and apply a k nearest neighbor approach to predict known and unknown cell
types. Our method correctly classifies 67/67 independent replication-timing
profiles, including those derived from closely related intermediate stages. We
also apply this method to derive fingerprints for pluripotency in human and mouse
cells. Interestingly, the mouse pluripotency fingerprint overlaps almost
completely with previously identified genomic segments that switch from early to 
late replication as pluripotency is lost. Thereafter, replication timing and
transcription within these regions become difficult to reprogram back to
pluripotency, suggesting these regions highlight an epigenetic barrier to
reprogramming. In addition, the major histone cluster Hist1 consistently becomes 
later replicating in committed cell types, and several histone H1 genes in this
cluster are downregulated during differentiation, suggesting a possible
instrument for the chromatin compaction observed during differentiation. Finally,
we demonstrate that unknown samples can be classified independently using
site-specific PCR against fingerprint regions. In sum, replication fingerprints
provide a comprehensive means for cell characterization and are a promising tool 
for identifying regions with cell type-specific organization.

Microarray-based cancer prediction using single genes.

Author information: 
(1)Biometric Research Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of
Health, Rockville, MD 20852, USA.

BACKGROUND: Although numerous methods of using microarray data analysis for
cancer classification have been proposed, most utilize many genes to achieve
accurate classification. This can hamper interpretability of the models and ease 
of translation to other assay platforms. We explored the use of single genes to
construct classification models. We first identified the genes with the most
powerful univariate class discrimination ability and then constructed simple
classification rules for class prediction using the single genes.
RESULTS: We applied our model development algorithm to eleven cancer gene
expression datasets and compared classification accuracy to that for standard
methods including Diagonal Linear Discriminant Analysis, k-Nearest Neighbor,
Support Vector Machine and Random Forest. The single gene classifiers provided
classification accuracy comparable to or better than those obtained by existing
methods in most cases. We analyzed the factors that determined when simple single
gene classification is effective and when more complex modeling is warranted.
CONCLUSIONS: For most of the datasets examined, the single-gene classification
methods appear to work as well as more standard methods, suggesting that simple
models could perform well in microarray-based cancer prediction.

OBJECTIVE: To assist diagnosis of thyroid malignancy, implementing a decision
support system (DSS) using fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) data.
STUDY DESIGN: The set of 2,035 thyroid smears contained 1,886 smears of
nonmalignancy (class 1) and 150 smears of malignancy (class 2) verified
histologically. For each smear, 67 medical features were considered by the
expert, forming 2,036 feature vectors, which were fed into a DSS for
discriminating between malignant and nonmalignant smears. The DSS comprised a
feature selection and classification module using a combination of three
classifiers, the artificial neural network, the support vector machines, and the 
k-nearest neighbor, under the majority vote procedure.
RESULTS: The overall classification accuracy of the DSS was 98.6%, marginally
better than the FNAB (97.3%). The DSS had lower sensitivity (89.1%) and better
specificity (99.4%) compared to the FNAB. Regarding the smears characterized as
"suspicious" by FNAB, a significant improvement of overall accuracy was obtained 
by the proposed DSS system (84.6%) compared to the FNAB (50.0%).
CONCLUSION: The proposed DSS provides significant improvement compared to FNAB
regarding discrimination of smears characterized by an expert as "suspicious,"
reducing the number of patients undergoing surgical procedures.

This study presents a fully automatic, data-driven approach for texture-based
quantitative analysis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in
pulmonary computed tomography (CT) images. The approach uses supervised learning 
where the class labels are, in contrast to previous work, based on measured lung 
function instead of on manually annotated regions of interest (ROIs). A
quantitative measure of COPD is obtained by fusing COPD probabilities computed in
ROIs within the lung fields where the individual ROI probabilities are computed
using a k nearest neighbor (kNN ) classifier. The distance between two ROIs in
the kNN classifier is computed as the textural dissimilarity between the ROIs,
where the ROI texture is described by histograms of filter responses from a
multi-scale, rotation invariant Gaussian filter bank. The method was trained on
400 images from a lung cancer screening trial and subsequently applied to
classify 200 independent images from the same screening trial. The texture-based 
measure was significantly better at discriminating between subjects with and
without COPD than were the two most common quantitative measures of COPD in the
literature, which are based on density. The proposed measure achieved an area
under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.713 whereas the best
performing density measure achieved an AUC of 0.598. Further, the proposed
measure is as reproducible as the density measures, and there were indications
that it correlates better with lung function and is less influenced by
inspiration level.

In this paper, we classify the breast cancer of medical diagnostic data.
Information gain has been adapted for feature selections. Neural fuzzy (NF),
k-nearest neighbor (KNN), quadratic classifier (QC), each single model scheme as 
well as their associated, ensemble ones have been developed for classifications. 
In addition, a combined ensemble model with these three schemes has been
constructed for further validations. The experimental results indicate that the
ensemble learning performs better than individual single ones. Moreover, the
combined ensemble model illustrates the highest accuracy of classifications for
the breast cancer among all models.

Ultrasound has great potential to aid in the differential diagnosis of malignant 
and benign thyroid lesions, but interpretative pitfalls exist and the accuracy is
still poor. To overcome these difficulties, we developed and analyzed a range of 
knowledge representation techniques, which are a class of ThyroScan™ algorithms
from Global Biomedical Technologies Inc., California, USA, for automatic
classification of benign and malignant thyroid lesions. The analysis is based on 
data obtained from twenty nodules (ten benign and ten malignant) taken from 3D
contrast-enhanced ultrasound images. Fine needle aspiration biopsy and histology 
confirmed malignancy. Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and texture algorithms are
used to extract relevant features from the thyroid images. The resulting feature 
vectors are fed to three different classifiers: K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN),
Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN), and Decision Tree (DeTr). The performance of 
these classifiers is compared using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)
curves. Our results show that combination of DWT and texture features coupled
with K-NN resulted in good performance measures with the area of under the ROC
curve of 0.987, a classification accuracy of 98.9%, a sensitivity of 98%, and a
specificity of 99.8%. Finally, we have proposed a novel integrated index called
Thyroid Malignancy Index (TMI), which is made up of texture features, to diagnose
benign or malignant nodules using just one index. We hope that this TMI will help
clinicians in a more objective detection of benign and malignant thyroid lesions.

Photoacoustic spectroscopy of ovarian normal, benign, and malignant tissues: a
pilot study.

Kamath SD(1), Ray S, Mahato KK.

Author information: 
(1)Manipal University, Manipal Life Sciences Centre, Biophysics Unit, Manipal,
India.

Photoacoustic spectra of normal, benign, and malignant ovarian tissues are
recorded using 325-nm pulsed laser excitation in vitro. A total of 102 (34
normal, 38 benign, and 30 malignant) spectra are obtained from 22 samples
belonging to normal, benign, and malignant subjects. Applying multi-algorithm
approach, comprised of methods such as, principal component analysis (PCA) based 
k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) analysis, artificial neural network (ANN) analysis, and
support vector machine (SVM) analysis, classification of the data has been
carried out. For PCA, first the calibration set is formed by pooling 45 spectra, 
15 belonging to each of pathologically certified normal, benign, and malignant
samples. PCA is then performed on the data matrix, comprised of the six spectral 
features extracted from each of 45 calibration samples, and three principal
components (PCs) containing maximum diagnostic information are selected. The
scores of the selected PCs are used to train the k-NN, ANN, and SVM classifiers. 
The ANN used is a classical multilayer feed forward network with back propagation
algorithm for its training. For k-NN, the Euclidean distance based algorithm is
used and for SVM, one-versus-rest multiclass kernel-radial basis function is
used. The performance evaluation of the classification results are obtained by
calculating statistical parameters like specificity and sensitivity. ANN and k-NN
techniques showed identical performance with specificity and sensitivity values
of 100 and 86.76%, whereas SVM had these values at 100 and 80.18%, respectively. 
In order to determine the relative diagnostic performance of the techniques,
receiver operating characteristics analysis is also performed.

Combining PubMed knowledge and EHR data to develop a weighted bayesian network
for pancreatic cancer prediction.

Zhao D(1), Weng C.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032,
USA.

In this paper, we propose a novel method that combines PubMed knowledge and
Electronic Health Records to develop a weighted Bayesian Network Inference (BNI) 
model for pancreatic cancer prediction. We selected 20 common risk factors
associated with pancreatic cancer and used PubMed knowledge to weigh the risk
factors. A keyword-based algorithm was developed to extract and classify PubMed
abstracts into three categories that represented positive, negative, or neutral
associations between each risk factor and pancreatic cancer. Then we designed a
weighted BNI model by adding the normalized weights into a conventional BNI
model. We used this model to extract the EHR values for patients with or without 
pancreatic cancer, which then enabled us to calculate the prior probabilities for
the 20 risk factors in the BNI. The software iDiagnosis was designed to use this 
weighted BNI model for predicting pancreatic cancer. In an evaluation using a
case-control dataset, the weighted BNI model significantly outperformed the
conventional BNI and two other classifiers (k-Nearest Neighbor and Support Vector
Machine). We conclude that the weighted BNI using PubMed knowledge and EHR data
shows remarkable accuracy improvement over existing representative methods for
pancreatic cancer prediction.

Similarity evaluation in a content-based image retrieval (CBIR) CADx system for
characterization of breast masses on ultrasound images.

PURPOSE: The authors are developing a content-based image retrieval (CBIR) CADx
system to assist radiologists in characterization of breast masses on ultrasound 
images. In this study, the authors compared seven similarity measures to be
considered for the CBIR system. The similarity between the query and the
retrieved masses was evaluated based on radiologists' visual similarity
assessments.
METHODS: The CADx system retrieves masses that are similar to a query mass from a
reference library based on computer-extracted features using a k-nearest neighbor
(k-NN) approach. Among seven similarity measures evaluated for the CBIR system,
four similarity measures including linear discriminant analysis (LDA), Bayesian
neural network (BNN), cosine similarity measure (Cos), and Euclidean distance
(ED) similarity measure were compared by radiologists' visual assessment. For LDA
and BNN, the features of a query mass were combined first into a malignancy score
and then masses with similar scores were retrieved. For Cos and ED, similar
masses were retrieved based on the normalized dot product and the Euclidean
distance, respectively, between two feature vectors. For the observer study,
three most similar masses were retrieved for a given query mass with each method.
All query-retrieved mass pairs were mixed and presented to the radiologists in
random order. Three Mammography Quality Standards Act (MQSA) radiologists rated
the similarity between each pair using a nine-point similarity scale (1 = very
dissimilar, 9 = very similar). The accuracy of the CBIR CADx system using the
different similarity measures to characterize malignant and benign masses was
evaluated by ROC analysis.
RESULTS: The BNN measure used with the k-NN classifier provided slightly higher
performance for classification of malignant and benign masses (A(z) values of
0.87) than those with the LDA, Cos, and ED measures (A(z) of 0.86, 0.84, and
0.81, respectively). The average similarity ratings of all radiologists for LDA, 
BNN, Cos, and ED were 4.71, 4.95, 5.18, and 5.32, respectively. The k-NN with the
ED measures retrieved masses of significantly higher similarity (p < 0.008) than 
LDA and BNN.
CONCLUSIONS: Similarity measures using the resemblance of individual features in 
the multidimensional feature space can retrieve visually more similar masses than
similarity measures using the resemblance of the classifier scores. A CBIR system
that can most effectively retrieve similar masses to the query may not have the
best A(z).

A modified artificial immune system based pattern recognition approach--an
application to clinical diagnostics.

Zhao W(1), Davis CE.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, One Shields Avenue,
University of California, Davis, CA 95616, United States.

OBJECTIVE: This paper introduces a modified artificial immune system (AIS)-based 
pattern recognition method to enhance the recognition ability of the existing
conventional AIS-based classification approach and demonstrates the superiority
of the proposed new AIS-based method via two case studies of breast cancer
diagnosis.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Conventionally, the AIS approach is often coupled with the
k nearest neighbor (k-NN) algorithm to form a classification method called
AIS-kNN. In this paper we discuss the basic principle and possible problems of
this conventional approach, and propose a new approach where AIS is integrated
with the radial basis function--partial least square regression (AIS-RBFPLS).
Additionally, both the two AIS-based approaches are compared with two classical
and powerful machine learning methods, back-propagation neural network (BPNN) and
orthogonal radial basis function network (Ortho-RBF network).
RESULTS: The diagnosis results show that: (1) both the AIS-kNN and the AIS-RBFPLS
proved to be a good machine leaning method for clinical diagnosis, but the
proposed AIS-RBFPLS generated an even lower misclassification ratio, especially
in the cases where the conventional AIS-kNN approach generated poor
classification results because of possible improper AIS parameters. For example, 
based upon the AIS memory cells of "replacement threshold=0.3", the average
misclassification ratios of two approaches for study 1 are 3.36% (AIS-RBFPLS) and
9.07% (AIS-kNN), and the misclassification ratios for study 2 are 19.18%
(AIS-RBFPLS) and 28.36% (AIS-kNN); (2) the proposed AIS-RBFPLS presented its
robustness in terms of the AIS-created memory cells, showing a smaller standard
deviation of the results from the multiple trials than AIS-kNN. For example,
using the result from the first set of AIS memory cells as an example, the
standard deviations of the misclassification ratios for study 1 are 0.45%
(AIS-RBFPLS) and 8.71% (AIS-kNN) and those for study 2 are 0.49% (AIS-RBFPLS) and
6.61% (AIS-kNN); and (3) the proposed AIS-RBFPLS classification approaches also
yielded better diagnosis results than two classical neural network approaches of 
BPNN and Ortho-RBF network.
CONCLUSION: In summary, this paper proposed a new machine learning method for
complex systems by integrating the AIS system with RBFPLS. This new method
demonstrates its satisfactory effect on classification accuracy for clinical
diagnosis, and also indicates its wide potential applications to other diagnosis 
and detection problems.

A hybrid feature selection method for DNA microarray data.

Taiwan.

Gene expression profiles, which represent the state of a cell at a molecular
level, have great potential as a medical diagnosis tool. In cancer
classification, available training data sets are generally of a fairly small
sample size compared to the number of genes involved. Along with training data
limitations, this constitutes a challenge to certain classification methods.
Feature (gene) selection can be used to successfully extract those genes that
directly influence classification accuracy and to eliminate genes which have no
influence on it. This significantly improves calculation performance and
classification accuracy. In this paper, correlation-based feature selection (CFS)
and the Taguchi-genetic algorithm (TGA) method were combined into a hybrid
method, and the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) with the leave-one-out cross-validation 
(LOOCV) method served as a classifier for eleven classification profiles to
calculate the classification accuracy. Experimental results show that the
proposed method reduced redundant features effectively and achieved superior
classification accuracy. The classification accuracy obtained by the proposed
method was higher in ten out of the eleven gene expression data set test problems
when compared to other classification methods from the literature.

OBJECTIVE: Capsule endoscopy is useful in the diagnosis of small bowel diseases. 
However, the large number of images produced in each test is a tedious task for
physicians. To relieve burden of physicians, a new computer-aided detection
scheme is developed in this study, which aims to detect small bowel tumors for
capsule endoscopy.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: A novel textural feature based on multi-scale local binary
pattern is proposed to discriminate tumor images from normal images. Since tumor 
in small bowel exhibit great diversities in appearance, multiple classifiers are 
employed to improve detection accuracy. 1200 capsule endoscopy images chosen from
10 patients' data constitute test data in our experiment.
RESULTS: Multiple classifiers based on k-nearest neighbor, multilayer perceptron 
neural network and support vector machine, which are built from six different
ensemble rules, are experimented in three different color spaces. The results
demonstrate an encouraging detection accuracy of 90.50%, together with a
sensitivity of 92.33% and a specificity of 88.67%.
CONCLUSION: The proposed scheme using color texture features and classifier
ensemble is promising for small bowel tumor detection in capsule endoscopy
images.

5-fluorouracil in a human xenograft model of gastric cancer.

University, Shanghai, China.

The prediction of chemosensitivity is a challenging problem in the management of 
cancer. In the present study, a metabonomic approach was proposed to assess the
feasibility of chemosensitivity prediction in a human xenograft model of gastric 
cancer. BALB/c-nu/nu mice were transplanted with MKN-45 cell line to establish
the xenograft model. The mice were then randomized into treatment group
(cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil) and control group (0.9% sodium chloride), and
their plasma were collected before treatment. Metabolic profiles of all plasma
samples were acquired by using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled
with a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (HPLC/Q-TOF-MS). Based on the 
data of metabolic profiles and k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm, a prediction model
for chemosensitivity was developed and an average accuracy of 90.4% was achieved.
In addition, a series of endogenous metabolites, including
1-acyl-lysophosphatidycholines, polyunsaturated fatty acids and their
derivatives, were determined as potential indicators of chemosensitivity. In
conclusion, our results suggest that the proposed metabonomic approach allows
effective chemosensitivity prediction in human xenograft model of gastric cancer.
The approach presents a new concept in the chemosensitivtiy prediction of cancer 
and is expected to be developed as a powerful tool in the personalized cancer
therapy.

Improving cancer classification accuracy using gene pairs.

Chopra P(1), Lee J, Kang J, Lee S.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Human Genetics, School of Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta,
Georgia, United States of America.

Recent studies suggest that the deregulation of pathways, rather than individual 
genes, may be critical in triggering carcinogenesis. The pathway deregulation is 
often caused by the simultaneous deregulation of more than one gene in the
pathway. This suggests that robust gene pair combinations may exploit the
underlying bio-molecular reactions that are relevant to the pathway deregulation 
and thus they could provide better biomarkers for cancer, as compared to
individual genes. In order to validate this hypothesis, in this paper, we used
gene pair combinations, called doublets, as input to the cancer classification
algorithms, instead of the original expression values, and we showed that the
classification accuracy was consistently improved across different datasets and
classification algorithms. We validated the proposed approach using nine cancer
datasets and five classification algorithms including Prediction Analysis for
Microarrays (PAM), C4.5 Decision Trees (DT), Naive Bayesian (NB), Support Vector 
Machine (SVM), and k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN).

We demonstrate that morphological features pertinent to a tissue's pathology may 
be ascertained from localized measures of broadband reflectance, with a
mesoscopic resolution (100-μm lateral spot size) that permits scanning of an
entire margin for residual disease. The technical aspects and optimization of a
k-nearest neighbor classifier for automated diagnosis of pathologies are
presented, and its efficacy is validated in 29 breast tissue specimens. When
discriminating between benign and malignant pathologies, a sensitivity and
specificity of 91 and 77% was achieved. Furthermore, detailed subtissue-type
analysis was performed to consider how diverse pathologies influence scattering
response and overall classification efficacy. The increased sensitivity of this
technique may render it useful to guide the surgeon or pathologist where to
sample pathology for microscopic assessment.

classifiers in the context of medical decision support.

When constructing a pattern classifier, it is important to make best use of the
instances (a.k.a. cases, examples, patterns or prototypes) available for its
development. In this paper we present an extensive comparative analysis of
algorithms that, given a pool of previously acquired instances, attempt to select
those that will be the most effective to construct an instance-based classifier
in terms of classification performance, time efficiency and storage requirements.
We evaluate seven previously proposed instance selection algorithms and compare
their performance to simple random selection of instances. We perform the
evaluation using k-nearest neighbor classifier and three classification problems:
one with simulated Gaussian data and two based on clinical databases for breast
cancer detection and diagnosis, respectively. Finally, we evaluate the impact of 
the number of instances available for selection on the performance of the
selection algorithms and conduct initial analysis of the selected instances. The 
experiments show that for all investigated classification problems, it was
possible to reduce the size of the original development dataset to less than 3%
of its initial size while maintaining or improving the classification
performance. Random mutation hill climbing emerges as the superior selection
algorithm. Furthermore, we show that some previously proposed algorithms perform 
worse than random selection. Regarding the impact of the number of instances
available for the classifier development on the performance of the selection
algorithms, we confirm that the selection algorithms are generally more effective
as the pool of available instances increases. In conclusion, instance selection
is generally beneficial for instance-based classifiers as it can improve their
performance, reduce their storage requirements and improve their response time.
However, choosing the right selection algorithm is crucial.

In order to assist doctors in making the diagnosis of mammographic masses, a
method is proposed in this paper. Twenty-two features are extracted from each
queried region of interest (ROI). A k-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm is used to
retrieve similar images from database, and further calculate the mutual
information (MI) between the queried image and the images which are in the
retrieval results, so as to improve the retrieval performance. Finally, the
scheme takes the first nine images with the highest MI scores as the final
retrieval results. With the purpose of providing available decision-making
information of diagnostic aids, we compare and analyze three calculating methods 
of decision index. The experiment results show that this method is better than
the method using KNN only, and this method improves the accuracy of diagnosis
effectively.

Predicting enzyme targets for cancer drugs by profiling human metabolic reactions
in NCI-60 cell lines.

Institute and Department of Radiology, The Methodist Hospital, Weill Cornell
Medical College, Houston, TX 77030, USA.

BACKGROUND: Drugs can influence the whole metabolic system by targeting enzymes
which catalyze metabolic reactions. The existence of interactions between drugs
and metabolic reactions suggests a potential way to discover drug targets.
RESULTS: In this paper, we present a computational method to predict new targets 
for approved anti-cancer drugs by exploring drug-reaction interactions. We
construct a Drug-Reaction Network to provide a global view of drug-reaction
interactions and drug-pathway interactions. The recent reconstruction of the
human metabolic network and development of flux analysis approaches make it
possible to predict each metabolic reaction's cell line-specific flux state based
on the cell line-specific gene expressions. We first profile each reaction by its
flux states in NCI-60 cancer cell lines, and then propose a kernel k-nearest
neighbor model to predict related metabolic reactions and enzyme targets for
approved cancer drugs. We also integrate the target structure data with reaction 
flux profiles to predict drug targets and the area under curves can reach 0.92.
CONCLUSIONS: The cross validations using the methods with and without metabolic
network indicate that the former method is significantly better than the latter. 
Further experiments show the synergism of reaction flux profiles and target
structure for drug target prediction. It also implies the significant
contribution of metabolic network to predict drug targets. Finally, we apply our 
method to predict new reactions and possible enzyme targets for cancer drugs.

Metabolic profiles of nucleosides studied on the level of urine are closely
related to the pathophysiological status of the organism. Posttranscriptional
modifications of RNA (mostly tRNA) in cell nucleus are responsible for change of 
nucleoside levels during malignant disease. In this paper, 256 metabolite
profiles from 160 urogenital tract cancer patients and 96 healthy controls,
composed of 19 nucleosides were collected and studied with the application of
such an approach. This approach comprised of the analysis of urine extracts and
the investigation of collected nucleoside and modified nucleoside profiles by
advanced statistical data processing tools such as principal component analysis
(PCA), hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), K-Nearest Neighbor method (kNN) and
partial least squares-discriminant analysis with probabilistic function
(p-PLS-DA). It has been shown that alterations of metabolite profiles in cancer
diseases are mainly expressed by the fold change of the urine levels of most
nucleosides. In addition, observed metabolite-to-metabolite ratios differ in
urogenital cancer patients compared to healthy controls. The obtained
relationships between urinary nucleoside profiles and the presence of cancer
diseases have been evaluated. Discrimination of the cancer patients and the
non-cancer healthy subjects is with 76.5% sensitivity and 80.2% specificity. The 
presented results prove the usefulness of the metabolomic approach in studying
urinary nucleoside profiles with high diagnostic potency in urogenital cancer
diseases. Profiles of urinary nucleosides might be employed as a reliable and
convenient tool in the diagnostics of urogenital tract cancer diseases.

PURPOSE: To determine the feasibility of texture analysis for the classification 
of liver cysts and hemangiomas, on nonenhanced, zero-fill interpolated T1- and
T2-weighted MR images.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-five patients (26 women and 19 men; mean age, 58.1
+/- 16.9 years) with liver cysts or hemangiomas were enrolled in the study. After
exclusion of images with artifacts, T1-weighted images of 42 patients, and
T2-weighted images of 39 patients, obtained at 3.0 Tesla (T), were available for 
further analysis. Texture features derived from the gray-level histogram,
co-occurrence and run-length matrix, gradient, autoregressive model, and wavelet 
transform were calculated. Fisher, probability of classification error and
average correlation (POE+ACC), and mutual information coefficients were used to
extract subsets of optimized texture features. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA)
in combination with k nearest neighbor (k-NN) classification, and k-means
clustering, were used for lesion classification.
RESULTS: LDA/k-NN produced misclassification rates of 16-18% on T1-weighted, and 
12-18% on T2-weighted images. K-means clustering yielded misclassification rates 
of 15-23% on T1-weighted, and 15-25% on T2-weighted images.
CONCLUSION: Texture-based classification of liver cysts and hemangiomas is
feasible on zero-fill interpolated MR images obtained at 3.0T. Further studies
are warranted to investigate the value of texture-based classification of other
liver lesions, such as hepatocellular and cholangiocellular carcinoma, on MRI.

In the clinical application of genomic data analysis and modeling, a number of
factors contribute to the performance of disease classification and clinical
outcome prediction. This study focuses on the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) modeling
strategy and its clinical use. Although KNN is simple and clinically appealing,
large performance variations were found among experienced data analysis teams in 
the MicroArray Quality Control Phase II (MAQC-II) project. For clinical end
points and controls from breast cancer, neuroblastoma and multiple myeloma, we
systematically generated 463,320 KNN models by varying feature ranking method,
number of features, distance metric, number of neighbors, vote weighting and
decision threshold. We identified factors that contribute to the MAQC-II project 
performance variation, and validated a KNN data analysis protocol using a newly
generated clinical data set with 478 neuroblastoma patients. We interpreted the
biological and practical significance of the derived KNN models, and compared
their performance with existing clinical factors.

breast masses.

RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Lesion conspicuity is typically highly correlated with 
visual difficulty for lesion detection, and computer-aided detection (CAD) has
been widely used as a "second reader" in mammography. Hence, increasing CAD
sensitivity in detecting subtle cancers without increasing false-positive rates
is important. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of training
database case selection on CAD performance in detecting low-conspicuity breast
masses.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A full-field digital mammographic image database that
included 525 cases depicting malignant masses was randomly partitioned into three
subsets. A CAD scheme was applied to detect all initially suspected mass regions 
and compute region conspicuity. Training samples were iteratively selected from
two of the subsets. Four types of training data sets-(1) one including all
available true-positive mass regions in the two subsets ("all"), (2) one
including 350 randomly selected mass regions ("diverse"), (3) one including 350
high-conspicuity mass regions ("easy"), and (4) one including 350 low-conspicuity
mass regions ("difficult")-were assembled. In each training data set, the same
number of randomly selected false-positive regions as the true-positives were
also included. Two classifiers, an artificial neural network (ANN) and a
k-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm, were trained using each of the four training 
data sets and tested on all suspected regions in the remaining data set. Using a 
threefold cross-validation method, the performance changes of the CAD schemes
trained using one of the four training data sets were computed and compared.
RESULTS: CAD initially detected 1025 true-positive mass regions depicted on 507
cases (97% case-based sensitivity) and 9569 false-positive regions (3.5 per
image) in the entire database. Using the all training data set, CAD achieved the 
highest overall performance on the entire testing database. However, CAD detected
the highest number of low-conspicuity masses when the difficult training data set
was used for training. Results did agree for both ANN-based and KNN-based
classifiers in all tests. Compared to the use of the all training data set, the
sensitivity of the schemes trained using the difficult data set decreased by 8.6%
and 8.4% for the ANN and KNN algorithm on the entire database, respectively, but 
the detection of low-conspicuity masses increased by 7.1% and 15.1% for the ANN
and KNN algorithm at a false-positive rate of 0.3 per image.
CONCLUSIONS: CAD performance depends on the size, diversity, and difficulty level
of the training database. To increase CAD sensitivity in detecting subtle cancer,
one should increase the fraction of difficult cases in the training database
rather than simply increasing the training data set size.

Fuzzy-rough supervised attribute clustering algorithm and classification of
microarray data.

India. pmaji@isical.ac.in

One of the major tasks with gene expression data is to find groups of coregulated
genes whose collective expression is strongly associated with sample categories. 
In this regard, a new clustering algorithm, termed as fuzzy-rough supervised
attribute clustering (FRSAC), is proposed to find such groups of genes. The
proposed algorithm is based on the theory of fuzzy-rough sets, which directly
incorporates the information of sample categories into the gene clustering
process. A new quantitative measure is introduced based on fuzzy-rough sets that 
incorporates the information of sample categories to measure the similarity among
genes. The proposed algorithm is based on measuring the similarity between genes 
using the new quantitative measure, whereby redundancy among the genes is
removed. The clusters are refined incrementally based on sample categories. The
effectiveness of the proposed FRSAC algorithm, along with a comparison with
existing supervised and unsupervised gene selection and clustering algorithms, is
demonstrated on six cancer and two arthritis data sets based on the class
separability index and predictive accuracy of the naive Bayes' classifier, the
K-nearest neighbor rule, and the support vector machine.

3d QSAR studies on a series of quinazoline derrivatives as tyrosine kinase (egfr)
inhibitor: the k-nearest neighbor molecular field analysis approach.

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) are known
for its role in cancer. Quinazoline have been reported to be the molecules of
interest, with potent anticancer activity and they act by binding to ATP site of 
protein kinases. ATP binding site of protein kinases provides an extensive
opportunity to design newer analogs. With this background, we report an attempt
to discern the structural and physicochemical requirements for inhibition of EGFR
tyrosine kinase. The k-Nearest Neighbor Molecular Field Analysis (kNN-MFA), a
three dimensional quantitative structure activity relationship (3D- QSAR) method 
has been used in the present case to study the correlation between the molecular 
properties and the tyrosine kinase (EGFR) inhibitory activities on a series of
quinazoline derivatives. kNNMFA calculations for both electrostatic and steric
field were carried out. The master grid maps derived from the best model has been
used to display the contribution of electrostatic potential and steric field. The
statistical results showed significant correlation coefficient r(2) (q(2)) of
0.846, r(2) for external test set (pred_r2) 0.8029, coefficient of correlation of
predicted data set (pred_r(2)se) of 0.6658, degree of freedom 89 and k nearest
neighbor of 2. Therefore, this study not only casts light on binding mechanism
between EGFR and its inhibitors, but also provides hints for the design of new
EGFR inhibitors with observable structural diversity.

Individualized computer-aided education in mammography based on user modeling:
concept and preliminary experiments.

Mazurowski MA(1), Baker JA, Barnhart HX, Tourassi GD.

Author information:

University, Durham, North Carolina 27705, USA. maciej.mazurowski@duke.edu

PURPOSE: The authors propose the framework for an individualized adaptive
computer-aided educational system in mammography that is based on user modeling. 
The underlying hypothesis is that user models can be developed to capture the
individual error making patterns of radiologists-in-training. In this pilot
study, the authors test the above hypothesis for the task of breast cancer
diagnosis in mammograms.
METHODS: The concept of a user model was formalized as the function that relates 
image features to the likelihood/extent of the diagnostic error made by a
radiologist-in-training and therefore to the level of difficulty that a case will
pose to the radiologist-in-training (or "user"). Then, machine learning
algorithms were implemented to build such user models. Specifically, the authors 
explored k-nearest neighbor, artificial neural networks, and multiple regression 
for the task of building the model using observer data collected from ten
Radiology residents at Duke University Medical Center for the problem of breast
mass diagnosis in mammograms. For each resident, a user-specific model was
constructed that predicts the user's expected level of difficulty for each
presented case based on two BI-RADS image features. In the experiments,
leave-one-out data handling scheme was applied to assign each case to a
low-predicted-difficulty or a high-predicted-difficulty group for each resident
based on each of the three user models. To evaluate whether the user model is
useful in predicting difficulty, the authors performed statistical tests using
the generalized estimating equations approach to determine whether the mean
actual error is the same or not between the low-predicted-difficulty group and
the high-predicted-difficulty group.
RESULTS: When the results for all observers were pulled together, the actual
errors made by residents were statistically significantly higher for cases in the
high-predicted-difficulty group than for cases in the low-predicted-difficulty
group for all modeling algorithms (p < or = 0.002 for all methods). This
indicates that the user models were able to accurately predict difficulty level
of the analyzed cases. Furthermore, the authors determined that among the two
BI-RADS features that were used in this study, mass margin was the most useful in
predicting individual user errors.
CONCLUSIONS: The pilot study shows promise for developing individual user models 
that can accurately predict the level of difficulty that each case will pose to
the radiologist-in-training. These models could allow for constructing adaptive
computer-aided educational systems in mammography.

Exploring the within- and between-class correlation distributions for tumor
classification.

To many biomedical researchers, effective tumor classification methods such as
the support vector machine often appear like a black box not only because the
procedures are complex but also because the required specifications, such as the 
choice of a kernel function, suffer from a clear guidance either mathematically
or biologically. As commonly observed, samples within the same tumor class tend
to be more similar in gene expression than samples from different tumor classes. 
But can this well-received observation lead to a useful procedure of
classification and prediction? To address this issue, we first conceived a
statistical framework and derived general conditions to serve as the theoretical 
foundation that supported the aforementioned empirical observation. Then we
constructed a classification procedure that fully utilized the information
obtained by comparing the distributions of within-class correlations with
between-class correlations via Kullback-Leibler divergence. We compared our
approach with many machine-learning techniques by applying to 22 binary- and
multiclass gene-expression datasets involving human cancers. The results showed
that our method performed as efficiently as support vector machine and Naïve
Bayesian and outperformed other learning methods (decision trees, linear
discriminate analysis, and k-nearest neighbor). In addition, we conducted a
simulation study and showed that our method would be more effective if the
arriving new samples are subject to the often-encountered baseline shift or
increased noise level problems. Our method can be extended for general
classification problems when only the similarity scores between samples are
available.

Automated aortic calcium scoring on low-dose chest computed tomography.

Ginneken B.

PURPOSE: Thoracic computed tomography (CT) scans provide information about
cardiovascular risk status. These scans are non-ECG synchronized, thus precise
quantification of coronary calcifications is difficult. Aortic calcium scoring is
less sensitive to cardiac motion, so it is an alternative to coronary calcium
scoring as an indicator of cardiovascular risk. The authors developed and
evaluated a computer-aided system for automatic detection and quantification of
aortic calcifications in low-dose noncontrast-enhanced chest CT.
METHODS: The system was trained and tested on scans from participants of a lung
cancer screening trial. A total of 433 low-dose, non-ECG-synchronized,
noncontrast-enhanced 16 detector row examinations of the chest was randomly
divided into 340 training and 93 test data sets. A first observer manually
identified aortic calcifications on training and test scans. A second observer
did the same on the test scans only. First, a multiatlas-based segmentation
method was developed to delineate the aorta. Segmented volume was thresholded and
potential calcifications (candidate objects) were extracted by three-dimensional 
connected component labeling. Due to image resolution and noise, in rare cases
extracted candidate objects were connected to the spine. They were separated into
a part outside and parts inside the aorta, and only the latter was further
analyzed. All candidate objects were represented by 63 features describing their 
size, position, and texture. Subsequently, a two-stage classification with a
selection of features and k-nearest neighbor classifiers was performed. Based on 
the detected aortic calcifications, total calcium volume score was determined for
each subject.
RESULTS: The computer system correctly detected, on the average, 945 mm3 out of
965 mm3 (97.9%) calcified plaque volume in the aorta with an average of 64 mm3 of
false positive volume per scan. Spearman rank correlation coefficient was p =
0.960 between the system and the first observer compared to p = 0.961 between the
two observers.
CONCLUSIONS: Automatic calcium scoring in the aorta thus appears feasible with
good correlation between manual and automatic scoring.

Learning curves in classification with microarray data.

The performance of many repeated tasks improves with experience and practice.
This improvement tends to be rapid initially and then decreases. The term
"learning curve" is often used to describe the phenomenon. In supervised machine 
learning, the performance of classification algorithms often increases with the
number of observations used to train the algorithm. We use progressively larger
samples of observations to train the algorithm and then plot performance against 
the number of training observations. This yields the familiar negatively
accelerating learning curve. To quantify the learning curve, we fit inverse power
law models to the progressively sampled data. We fit such learning curves to four
large clinical cancer genomic datasets, using three classifiers (diagonal linear 
discriminant analysis, K-nearest-neighbor with three neighbors, and support
vector machines) and four values for the number of top genes included (5, 50,
500, 5,000). The inverse power law models fit the progressively sampled data
reasonably well and showed considerable diversity when multiple classifiers are
applied to the same data. Some classifiers showed rapid and continued increase in
performance as the number of training samples increased, while others showed
little if any improvement. Assessing classifier efficiency is particularly
important in genomic studies since samples are so expensive to obtain. It is
important to employ an algorithm that uses the predictive information
efficiently, but with a modest number of training samples (>50), learning curves 
can be used to assess the predictive efficiency of classification algorithms.

Computer-aided Prognosis of Neuroblastoma on Whole-slide Images: Classification
of Stromal Development.

We are developing a computer-aided prognosis system for neuroblastoma (NB), a
cancer of the nervous system and one of the most malignant tumors affecting
children. Histopathological examination is an important stage for further
treatment planning in routine clinical diagnosis of NB. According to the
International Neuroblastoma Pathology Classification (the Shimada system), NB
patients are classified into favorable and unfavorable histology based on the
tissue morphology. In this study, we propose an image analysis system that
operates on digitized H&E stained whole-slide NB tissue samples and classifies
each slide as either stroma-rich or stroma-poor based on the degree of Schwannian
stromal development. Our statistical framework performs the classification based 
on texture features extracted using co-occurrence statistics and local binary
patterns. Due to the high resolution of digitized whole-slide images, we propose 
a multi-resolution approach that mimics the evaluation of a pathologist such that
the image analysis starts from the lowest resolution and switches to higher
resolutions when necessary. We employ an offine feature selection step, which
determines the most discriminative features at each resolution level during the
training step. A modified k-nearest neighbor classifier is used to determine the 
confidence level of the classification to make the decision at a particular
resolution level. The proposed approach was independently tested on 43
whole-slide samples and provided an overall classification accuracy of 88.4%.

Tabu search and binary particle swarm optimization for feature selection using
microarray data.

Chuang LY(1), Yang CH, Yang CH.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Chemical Engineering, I-Shou University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.

Gene expression profiles have great potential as a medical diagnosis tool because
they represent the state of a cell at the molecular level. In the classification 
of cancer type research, available training datasets generally have a fairly
small sample size compared to the number of genes involved. This fact poses an
unprecedented challenge to some classification methodologies due to training data
limitations. Therefore, a good selection method for genes relevant for sample
classification is needed to improve the predictive accuracy, and to avoid
incomprehensibility due to the large number of genes investigated. In this
article, we propose to combine tabu search (TS) and binary particle swarm
optimization (BPSO) for feature selection. BPSO acts as a local optimizer each
time the TS has been run for a single generation. The K-nearest neighbor method
with leave-one-out cross-validation and support vector machine with
one-versus-rest serve as evaluators of the TS and BPSO. The proposed method is
applied and compared to the 11 classification problems taken from the literature.
Experimental results show that our method simplifies features effectively and
either obtains higher classification accuracy or uses fewer features compared to 
other feature selection methods.

(1)Computer Engineering and Informatics Department, University of Patras, Patras,
Greece.

The objective of this study is the classification of the breast ductal tree
structures appearing in galactograms in order to investigate the relation between
topological properties of the tree-like parenchymal networks and radiological
findings regarding breast cancer. We present two different methods to
characterize the spatial distribution of branching points; a variation of Sholl's
analysis and a sectoring technique. Similarity searches and k-nearest neighbor
classification of the trees are performed using the cosine similarity metric. We 
applied our approach to clinical x-ray galactograms to distinguish between cases 
with reported radiological findings and cases with no reported findings.
Experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods,
indicating that our analysis can potentially aid in early breast cancer
diagnosis.

Computational modeling continues to play an important role in novel therapeutics 
discovery and development. In this study, we have investigated the use of in
silico approaches to develop inhibitors of the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of
AKT (protein kinase B). Various docking/scoring schemes have been evaluated, and 
the best combination was selected to study the system. Using this strategy, two
hits were identified and their binding behaviors were investigated. Robust and
predictive QSAR models were built using the k nearest neighbor (kNN) method to
study their cellular permeability. Based on our in silico results, long flexible 
aliphatic tails were proposed to improve the Caco-2 penetration without affecting
the binding mode. The modifications enhanced the AKT inhibitory activity of the
compounds in cell-based assays, and increased their activity as in vivo antitumor
testing.

Tumor proteomic profiling predicts the susceptibility of breast cancer to
chemotherapy.

Chemotherapy is often used for breast cancer treatment, but individual outcome
varies widely. We hypothesized that tumor proteomic profiles obtained prior to
chemotherapy may predict the individual tumor response to treatment. The goal of 
our study was to explore feasibility of using proteomic profiling to preselect
patients for an effective chemotherapeutic regimen. Tumors from 52 patients with 
T2-T4 breast cancer were prospectively collected before neoadjuvant chemotherapy,
and were analyzed using surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization/time of
flight (SELDI) mass spectrometry. Mass spectral profiles were obtained from
tumors with various sensitivities to chemotherapy. Both non-supervised
hierarchical clustering and supervised neural network-based classification
approaches were employed to compare the profiles. The first two thirds of the
enrolled cases (35) were allocated to a training set to select peaks
characteristic of resistant tumors. The candidate peaks were used to develop a
predicting rule to evaluate the remaining 17 specimens in the validation set. In 
the training set, the most prominent differences were found between drug
resistant and drug susceptible tumors by non-supervised hierarchical clustering. 
In the validation set, the supervised classification with the K nearest neighbor 
(KNN) model correctly classified most tumor responses with an accuracy rate of
92.3% [100% of resistant tumors (4/4), and 84.6% of the tumors with favorable
response (11/13)]. In the entire group, a single peak at m/z 16,906 correctly
separated 88.9% of the tumors with pathologically complete response, and 91.7% of
the resistant tumors. The data suggest that breast cancer protein biomarkers may 
be used to pre-select patients for optimal chemotherapeutic treatment.

Automated radiation targeting in head-and-neck cancer using region-based texture 
analysis of PET and CT images.

Yu H(1), Caldwell C, Mah K, Poon I, Balogh J, MacKenzie R, Khaouam N, Tirona R.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.

PURPOSE: A co-registered multimodality pattern analysis segmentation system
(COMPASS) was developed to automatically delineate the radiation targets in
head-and-neck cancer (HNC) using both (18)F-fluoro-deoxy glucose-positron
emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) images. The performance of
the COMPASS was compared with the results of existing threshold-based methods and
radiation oncologist-drawn contours.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: The COMPASS extracted texture features from corresponding 
PET and CT voxels. Using these texture features, a decision-tree-based
K-nearest-neighbor classifier labeled each voxel as either "normal" or
"abnormal." The COMPASS was applied to the PET/CT images of 10 HNC patients.
Automated segmentation results were validated against the manual segmentations of
three radiation oncologists using the volume, sensitivity, and specificity. The
performance of the COMPASS was compared with three PET-based threshold methods:
standard uptake value of 2.5, 50% maximal intensity, and signal/background ratio.
RESULTS: The tumor delineations of the COMPASS were both quantitatively and
qualitatively more similar to those of the radiation oncologists than the
delineations from the other methods. The specificity was 95% +/- 2%, 84% +/- 9%, 
98% +/- 3%, and 96% +/- 4%, and the sensitivity was 90% +/- 12%, 93% +/- 10%, 48%
+/- 20%, and 68% +/- 25% for the COMPASS, for a standard uptake value of 2.5, 50%
maximal intensity, and signal/background ratio, respectively. The COMPASS
distinguished HNC from adjacent normal tissues with high physiologic uptake and
consistently defined tumors with large variability in (18)F-fluoro-deoxy glucose 
uptake, which are often problematic with the threshold-based methods.
CONCLUSION: Automated segmentation using texture analysis of PET/CT images has
the potential to provide accurate delineation of HNC. This could lead to reduced 
interobserver variability, reduced uncertainty in target delineation, and
improved treatment planning accuracy.

Pattern recognition techniques suffer from a well-known curse, the dimensionality
problem. The microarray data classification problem is a classical complex
pattern recognition problem. Selecting relevant genes from microarray data poses 
a formidable challenge to researchers due to the high-dimensionality of features,
multiclass categories being involved, and the usually small sample size. The goal
of feature (gene) selection is to select those subsets of differentially
expressed genes that are potentially relevant for distinguishing the sample
classes. In this paper, information gain and chaotic genetic algorithm are
proposed for the selection of relevant genes, and a K-nearest neighbor with the
leave-one-out crossvalidation method serves as a classifier. The chaotic genetic 
algorithm is modified by using the chaotic mutation operator to increase the
population diversity. The enhanced population diversity expands the GA's search
ability. The proposed approach is tested on 10 microarray data sets from the
literature. The experimental results show that the proposed method not only
effectively reduced the number of gene expression levels, but also achieved lower
classification error rates than other methods.

An automated algorithm and methodology is presented to identify tumor-tissue
morphologies based on broadband scatter data measured by raster scan imaging of
the samples. A quasi-confocal reflectance imaging system was used to directly
measure the tissue scatter reflectance in situ, and the spectrum was used to
identify the scattering power, amplitude, and total wavelength-integrated
intensity. Pancreatic tumor and normal samples were characterized using the
instrument, and subtle changes in the scatter signal were encountered within
regions of each sample. Discrimination between normal versus tumor tissue was
readily performed using a K-nearest neighbor classifier algorithm. A similar
approach worked for regions of tumor morphology when statistical preprocessing of
the scattering parameters was included to create additional data features. This
type of automated interpretation methodology can provide a tool for guiding
surgical resection in areas where microscopy imaging cannot be realized
efficiently by the surgeon. In addition, the results indicate important design
changes for future systems.

Patients with carcinoma of unknown primary (CUP) present with metastatic disease 
for which the primary site cannot be found, despite extensive standard
investigation. Here, we describe the development and implementation of the first 
clinically available microarray-based test for this cancer type (CUPPrint), based
on 633 individual tumors representing 30 carcinoma and 17 noncarcinoma classes.
Tissue of origin prediction for either fresh frozen or paraffin-embedded tumor
samples is achieved with the use of a custom 8-pack 1.9k microarray and robust
classification algorithm. An expression profile of 495 genes was used to predict 
tumor origin by applying a k-nearest neighbor algorithm. Internal
cross-validation and analysis of an independent, previously published, 229-sample
dataset revealed that clinically informative predictions were made for up to 94% 
of samples analyzed. Analysis of 13 previously published CUP specimens yielded
predicted tumor origins that supported the clinical suspicion in 12 cases (92%). 
Microarray profiling presents a promising tool to assist in the identification of
the primary tumor and might direct a more tailored treatment for CUP patients.

Assessment of performance improvement in content-based medical image retrieval
schemes using fractal dimension.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Radiology, University of Pittsburgh, 3362 Fifth Avenue,
Pittsburgh, PA 15213, USA. parks@upmc.edu

RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate whether using 
a fractal dimension as an objective index (quantitative measure) to assess and
control the "visual" or "texture" similarity of reference-image regions selected 
by a content-based image retrieval (CBIR) scheme would (or would not) affect the 
performance of the scheme in classification between image regions depicting
suspicious breast masses.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: An image data set depicting 1500 verified mass regions and
1500 false-positive mass regions was used. Fourteen morphologic and intensity
distribution features and a fractal dimension were computed. A CBIR scheme using 
a k-nearest neighbor classifier was applied, and two experiments were conducted. 
In the first experiment, the CBIR scheme was evaluated using all 15 features. In 
the second experiment, the fractal dimension was used as a prescreening feature
to guide the CBIR scheme to search for the most similar reference images that had
similar measures in the fractal dimension.
RESULTS: The CBIR scheme achieved classification performance with areas under the
receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.857 (95% confidence interval [CI],
0.844-0.870) using 14 features and 0.866 (95% CI, 0.853-0.879) after adding the
fractal dimension (P = .005 for both results). After using the fractal dimension 
as a prescreening feature, the CBIR scheme achieved an area under the
receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.851 (95% CI, 0.837-0.864), without a
significant difference from the previous result using the original 14 features (P
= .120). The difference of fractal dimension values between the selected similar 
reference images was reduced by 56.7%, indicating improvement in image texture
similarity. In addition, more than half of references were discarded early,
without similarity comparisons, indicating improvement in searching efficiency.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the feasibility of applying a fractal
dimension as an objective (quantitative) and efficient search index to assess and
maintain the texture similarity of reference mass regions selected by a CBIR
scheme without reducing the scheme's performance in classifying suspicious breast
masses.

Principal component analysis (PCA)-based k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) analysis of
colonic mucosal tissue fluorescence spectra.

Kamath SD(1), Mahato KK.

Author information:

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to verify the suitability of principal
component analysis (PCA)-based k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) analysis for
discriminating normal and malignant autofluorescence spectra of colonic mucosal
tissues.
BACKGROUND DATA: Autofluorescence spectroscopy, a noninvasive technique, has high
specificity and sensitivity for discrimination of diseased and nondiseased
colonic tissues. Previously, we assessed the efficacy of the technique on colonic
data using PCA Match/No match and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) analyses. To 
improve the classification reliability, the present work was conducted using
PCA-based k-NN analysis and was compared with previously obtained results.
METHODS: A total of 115 fluorescence spectra (69 normal and 46 malignant) were
recorded from 13 normal and 10 malignant colonic tissues with 325 nm pulsed laser
excitation in the spectral region 350-600 nm in vitro. We applied PCA to extract 
the relevant information from the spectra and used a nonparametric k-NN analysis 
for classification.
RESULTS: The normal and malignant spectra showed large variations in shape and
intensity. Statistically significant differences were found between normal and
malignant classes. The performance of the analysis was evaluated by calculating
the statistical parameters specificity and sensitivity, which were found to be
100% and 91.3%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The results obtained in this study showed good discrimination between
normal and malignant conditions using PCA-based k-NN analysis.

BACKGROUND: Currently no standardized blood test exists for breast cancer
screening or staging purposes. The goals of this study were to use proteomic mass
spectrometry approaches for profiling, fractionation, and identification of serum
proteins from breast cancer patients for discovery of new biomarkers of stage and
nodal status.
STUDY DESIGN: Samples from 150 patients were collected preoperatively for
patients undergoing breast biopsy. Serum was processed using weak cation exchange
(WCX) fractionation and analyzed with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization
time of flight mass spectrometry. Spectra were processed and group profiles, peak
statistics, and cross-validation scores were determined using a k-nearest
neighbor genetic algorithm. Pools of subgroups based on stage, race, and obesity 
were processed with WCX fractionation followed by trypsin digestion.
Differentially expressed proteins and peptides were identified by tandem mass
spectrometry.
RESULTS: Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight proteomic
profiling using WCX capture of serum proteins resulted in correct cancer stage
classifications ranging from 72% to 84%. Nodal status was classified correctly
with 88% cross-validation scores. Levels of endogenous low mass peptide fragments
derived from kininogen, fibrinogen, plasminogen, and inter-alpha-trypsin
inhibitor heavy chain 4 protein were increased in cancer stage III and stage IV
samples. Adding trypsin digestions with WCX capture indicated increased levels of
alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein, prothrombin, and serum amyloid A in stage IV samples.
Obesity, but not race, was a factor in the relative levels of detected
proteins/peptides.
CONCLUSIONS: WCX fractionation alone or with trypsin digestion of serum suggest
it can be possible to use a panel of proteins to predict breast cancer stage and 
nodal status. Additional study is required on the role of inflammatory molecules 
in breast cancer development.

A computer-aided system for malignancy risk assessment of nodules in thyroid US
images based on boundary features.

Author information:

Greece. msavel@di.uoa.gr

In this paper, a novel computer-based approach is proposed for malignancy risk
assessment of thyroid nodules in ultrasound images. The proposed approach is
based on boundary features and is motivated by the correlation which has been
addressed in medical literature between nodule boundary irregularity and
malignancy risk. In addition, local echogenicity variance is utilized so as to
incorporate information associated with local echogenicity distribution within
nodule boundary neighborhood. Such information is valuable for the discrimination
of high-risk nodules with blurred boundaries from medium-risk nodules with
regular boundaries. Analysis of variance is performed, indicating that each
boundary feature under study provides statistically significant information for
the discrimination of thyroid nodules in ultrasound images, in terms of
malignancy risk. k-nearest neighbor and support vector machine classifiers are
employed for the classification tasks, utilizing feature vectors derived from all
combinations of features under study. The classification results are evaluated
with the use of the receiver operating characteristic. It is derived that the
proposed approach is capable of discriminating between medium-risk and high-risk 
nodules, obtaining an area under curve, which reaches 0.95.

Medicine, Durham, North Carolina 27705, USA. herbert.pang@duke.edu

High-dimensional data such as microarrays have brought us new statistical
challenges. For example, using a large number of genes to classify samples based 
on a small number of microarrays remains a difficult problem. Diagonal
discriminant analysis, support vector machines, and k-nearest neighbor have been 
suggested as among the best methods for small sample size situations, but none
was found to be superior to others. In this article, we propose an improved
diagonal discriminant approach through shrinkage and regularization of the
variances. The performance of our new approach along with the existing methods is
studied through simulations and applications to real data. These studies show
that the proposed shrinkage-based and regularization diagonal discriminant
methods have lower misclassification rates than existing methods in many cases.

India. pmaji@isical.ac.in

Among the great amount of genes presented in microarray gene expression data,
only a small fraction is effective for performing a certain diagnostic test. In
this regard, mutual information has been shown to be successful for selecting a
set of relevant and nonredundant genes from microarray data. However, information
theory offers many more measures such as the f-information measures that may be
suitable for selection of genes from microarray gene expression data. This paper 
presents different f-information measures as the evaluation criteria for gene
selection problem. To compute the gene-gene redundancy (respectively, gene-class 
relevance), these information measures calculate the divergence of the joint
distribution of two genes' expression values (respectively, the expression values
of a gene and the class labels of samples) from the joint distribution when two
genes (respectively, the gene and class label) are considered to be completely
independent. The performance of different f-information measures is compared with
that of the mutual information based on the predictive accuracy of naive Bayes
classifier, K -nearest neighbor rule, and support vector machine. An important
finding is that some f-information measures are shown to be effective for
selecting relevant and nonredundant genes from microarray data. The effectiveness
of different f-information measures, along with a comparison with mutual
information, is demonstrated on breast cancer, leukemia, and colon cancer
datasets. While some f -information measures provide 100% prediction accuracy for
all three microarray datasets, mutual information attains this accuracy only for 
breast cancer dataset, and 98.6% and 93.6% for leukemia and colon cancer
datasets, respectively.

Classification of ultraviolet irradiated mouse skin histological stages by
bimodal spectroscopy: multiple excitation autofluorescence and diffuse
reflectance.

Histopathological analysis and in vivo optical spectroscopy were used to
discriminate several histological stages of UV-irradiated mouse skin. At
different times throughout the 30-week irradiation, autofluorescence (AF) and
diffuse reflectance (DR) spectra were acquired in a bimodal approach. Then skin
was sampled and processed to be classified, according to morphological criteria, 
into four histological categories: normal, and three types of hyperplasia
(compensatory, atypical, and dysplastic). After extracting spectral
characteristics, principal component analysis (data reduction) and the k-nearest 
neighbor classifying method were applied to compare diagnostic performances of
monoexcitation AF (based on each of the seven excitation wavelengths: 360, 368,
390, 400, 410, 420, and 430 nm), multiexcitation AF (combining the seven
excitation wavelengths), DR, and bimodal spectroscopies. Visible wavelengths are 
the most sensitive ones to discriminate compensatory from precancerous (atypical 
and dysplastic) states. Multiexcitation AF provides an average 6-percentage-point
increased sensitivity compared to the best scores obtained with monoexcitation AF
for all pairs of tissue categories. Bimodality results in a 4-percentage-point
increase of specificity when discriminating the three types of hyperplasia. Thus,
bimodal spectroscopy appears to be a promising tool to discriminate benign from
precancerous stages; clinical investigations should be carried out to confirm
these results.

Improving performance of computer-aided detection scheme by combining results
from two machine learning classifiers.

Pittsburgh, PA 15213, USA. parks@upmc.edu

RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Global data-based and local instance-based
machine-learning methods and classifiers have been widely used to optimize
computer-aided detection and diagnosis (CAD) schemes to classify between
true-positive and false-positive detections. In this study, the correlation
between these two types of classifiers was investigated using a new independent
testing data set, and the potential improvement of a CAD scheme's performance by 
combining the results of the two classifiers in detecting breast masses was
assessed.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The CAD scheme first used image filtering and a multilayer
topographic region growth algorithm to detect and segment suspicious mass
regions. The scheme then used an image feature-based classifier to classify these
regions into true-positive and false-positive regions. Two classifiers were used 
in this study. One was a global data-based machine-learning classifier, an
artificial neural network (ANN), and the other was a local instance-based
machine-learning classifier, a k-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm. An independent
image database including 400 mammographic examinations was used in this study. Of
these, 200 were cancer cases and 200 were negative cases. The preoptimized CAD
scheme was applied twice to the database using the two different classifiers. The
correlation between the two sets of classification results was analyzed. Three
sets of CAD performance results using the ANN, KNN, and average detection scores 
from both classifiers were assessed and compared using the free-response
receiver-operating characteristic method.
RESULTS: The results showed that the ANN achieved higher performance than the KNN
algorithm, with a normalized area under the performance curve (AUC) of 0.891
versus 0.845. The correlation coefficients between the detection scores generated
by the two classifiers were 0.436 and 0.161 for the true-positive and
false-positive detections, respectively. The average detection scores of the two 
classifiers improved CAD performance and reliability by increasing the AUC to
0.912 and reducing the standard error of the estimated AUC by 14.4%. The
detection sensitivity was also increased from 75.8% (ANN) and 65.9% (KNN) to
80.3% at a false-positive detection rate of 0.3 per image.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that two global data-based and local
data-based machine-learning classifiers (ANN and KNN) generated low correlated
detection results and that combining the detection scores of these two
classifiers significantly improved overall CAD performance (P < .01) and reduced 
standard error in CAD performance assessment.

outcome prediction: preliminary evaluation.

Ave., Columbus, OH 43210, USA.

In this paper, we present a method of quantifying the heterogeneity of cervical
cancer tumors for use in radiation treatment outcome prediction. Features based
on the distribution of masked wavelet decomposition coefficients in the tumor
region of interest (ROI) of temporal dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance
imaging (DCE-MRI) studies were used along with the imaged tumor volume to assess 
the response of the tumors to treatment. The wavelet decomposition combined with 
ROI masking was used to extract local intensity variations in the tumor. The
developed method was tested on a data set consisting of 23 patients with advanced
cervical cancer who underwent radiation therapy; 18 of these patients had local
control of the tumor, and five had local recurrence. Each patient participated in
two DCE-MRI studies: one prior to treatment and another early into treatment (2-4
weeks). An outcome of local control or local recurrence of the tumor was assigned
to each patient based on a posttherapy follow-up at least 2 years after the end
of treatment. Three different supervised classifiers were trained on
combinational subsets of the full wavelet and volume feature set. The
best-performing linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machine
(SVM) classifiers each had mean prediction accuracies of 95.7%, with the LDA
classifier being more sensitive (100% vs. 80%) and the SVM classifier being more 
specific (100% vs. 94.4%) in those cases. The K-nearest neighbor classifier
performed the best out of all three classifiers, having multiple feature sets
that were used to achieve 100% prediction accuracy. The use of distribution
measures of the masked wavelet coefficients as features resulted in much better
predictive performance than those of previous approaches based on tumor intensity
values and their distributions or tumor volume alone.

This study aims to assess three methods commonly used in content-based image
retrieval (CBIR) schemes and investigate the approaches to improve scheme
performance. A reference database involving 3000 regions of interest (ROIs) was
established. Among them, 400 ROIs were randomly selected to form a testing
dataset. Three methods, namely mutual information, Pearson's correlation and a
multi-feature-based k-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm, were applied to search
for the 15 'the most similar' reference ROIs to each testing ROI. The clinical
relevance and visual similarity of searching results were evaluated using the
areas under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (A(Z)) and average
mean square difference (MSD) of the mass boundary spiculation level ratings
between testing and selected ROIs, respectively. The results showed that the A(Z)
values were 0.893 +/- 0.009, 0.606 +/- 0.021 and 0.699 +/- 0.026 for the use of
KNN, mutual information and Pearson's correlation, respectively. The A(Z) values 
increased to 0.724 +/- 0.017 and 0.787 +/- 0.016 for mutual information and
Pearson's correlation when using ROIs with the size adaptively adjusted based on 
actual mass size. The corresponding MSD values were 2.107 +/- 0.718, 2.301 +/-
0.733 and 2.298 +/- 0.743. The study demonstrates that due to the diversity of
medical images, CBIR schemes using multiple image features and mass size-based
ROIs can achieve significantly improved performance.

Henares, Madrid 28805, Spain. roberto.gil@uah.es

The k-nearest neighbor method is a classifier based on the evaluation of the
distances to each pattern in the training set. The edited version of this method 
consists of the application of this classifier with a subset of the complete
training set in which some of the training patterns are excluded, in order to
reduce the classification error rate. In recent works, genetic algorithms have
been successfully applied to determine which patterns must be included in the
edited subset. In this paper we propose a novel implementation of a genetic
algorithm for designing edited k-nearest neighbor classifiers. It includes the
definition of a novel mean square error based fitness function, a novel clustered
crossover technique, and the proposal of a fast smart mutation scheme. In order
to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, results using the breast
cancer database, the diabetes database and the letter recognition database from
the UCI machine learning benchmark repository have been included. Both error rate
and computational cost have been considered in the analysis. Obtained results
show the improvement achieved by the proposed editing method.

Cancer DNA microarray analysis considering multi-subclass with graph-based
clustering method.

It is well known that various genes related to cell cycle, cell-cell adhesion,
and transcriptional regulation cause the onset of cancer. Moreover, environmental
factors including age, sex, and lifestyle can also contribute to the onset of
cancer. Therefore, it is difficult to ascertain which factors influence the
onset. Thus, patients suffering from same disease can be divided into several
distinct groups. In the present study, we applied graph-based clustering to
several DNA microarray datasets before the classification analysis. Several
clusters formed by the graph-based clustering were used for the construction of
multi-class classification model with the k-nearest neighbor and for finding
genes, which are specific to a certain cluster, by One vs. Others classification.
Using this approach, the classification model was constructed for four microarray
datasets, leukemia, breast cancer, prostate cancer, and colon cancer, and the
accuracies of classification with k-nearest neighbor were all more than 80%. And 
in the breast cancer dataset, we succeeded in finding genes that are specific in 
a cluster consisting of 38 control group samples. These results indicate the
importance of sample clustering before classification model construction.

Machine learning-based receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for crisp
and fuzzy classification of DNA microarrays in cancer research.

Peterson LE(1), Coleman MA.

Author information: 
(1)Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030 USA.

Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to obtain
classification area under the curve (AUC) as a function of feature
standardization, fuzzification, and sample size from nine large sets of
cancer-related DNA microarrays. Classifiers used included k nearest neighbor
(kNN), näive Bayes classifier (NBC), linear discriminant analysis (LDA),
quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), learning vector quantization (LVQ1),
logistic regression (LOG), polytomous logistic regression (PLOG), artificial
neural networks (ANN), particle swarm optimization (PSO), constricted particle
swarm optimization (CPSO), kernel regression (RBF), radial basis function
networks (RBFN), gradient descent support vector machines (SVMGD), and least
squares support vector machines (SVMLS). For each data set, AUC was determined
for a number of combinations of sample size, total sum[-log(p)] of feature
t-tests, with and without feature standardization and with (fuzzy) and without
(crisp) fuzzification of features. Altogether, a total of 2,123,530
classification runs were made. At the greatest level of sample size, ANN resulted
in a fitted AUC of 90%, while PSO resulted in the lowest fitted AUC of 72.1%. AUC
values derived from 4NN were the most dependent on sample size, while PSO was the
least. ANN depended the most on total statistical significance of features used
based on sum[-log(p)], whereas PSO was the least dependent. Standardization of
features increased AUC by 8.1% for PSO and -0.2% for QDA, while fuzzification
increased AUC by 9.4% for PSO and reduced AUC by 3.8% for QDA. AUC determination 
in planned microarray experiments without standardization and fuzzification of
features will benefit the most if CPSO is used for lower levels of feature
significance (i.e., sum[-log(p)] ~ 50) and ANN is used for greater levels of
significance (i.e., sum[-log(p)] ~ 500). When only standardization of features is
performed, studies are likely to benefit most by using CPSO for low levels of
feature statistical significance and LVQ1 for greater levels of significance.
Studies involving only fuzzification of features should employ LVQ1 because of
the substantial gain in AUC observed and low expense of LVQ1. Lastly, PSO
resulted in significantly greater levels of AUC (89.5% average) when feature
standardization and fuzzification were performed. In consideration of the data
sets used and factors influencing AUC which were investigated, if low-expense
computation is desired then LVQ1 is recommended. However, if computational
expense is of less concern, then PSO or CPSO is recommended.

performance.

Disease prediction through mass spectrometry (MS) data is gaining importance in
medical diagnosis. Particularly in cancerous diseases, early prediction is one of
the most life saving stages. High dimension and the noisy nature of MS data
requires a two-phase study for successful disease prediction; first, MS data must
be pre- processed with stages such as baseline correction, normalizing,
de-noising and peak detection. Second, a dimension reduction based classifier
design is the main objective. Having the data pre-processed, the prediction
accuracy of the classifier algorithm becomes the most significant factor in the
medical diagnosis phase. As health is the main concern, the accuracy of the
classifier is clearly very important. In this study, the effects of the pre-
processing stages of MS data on classifier performances are addressed. Three
pre-processing stages--baseline correction, normalization and de-noising--are
applied to three MS data samples, namely, high-resolution ovarian cancer,
low-resolution prostate cancer and a low-resolution ovarian cancer. To measure
the effects of the pre-processing stages quantitatively, four diverse
classifiers, genetic algorithm wrapped K-nearest neighbor (GA-KNN), principal
component analysis-based least discriminant analysis (PCA-LDA), a neural network 
(NN) and a support vector machine (SVM) are applied to the data sets. Calculated 
classifier performances have demonstrated the effects of pre-processing stages
quantitatively and the importance of pre-processing stages on the prediction
accuracy of classifiers. Results of computations have been shown clearly.

BACKGROUND: Dimension reduction is a critical issue in the analysis of microarray
data, because the high dimensionality of gene expression microarray data set
hurts generalization performance of classifiers. It consists of two types of
methods, i.e. feature selection and feature extraction. Principle component
analysis (PCA) and partial least squares (PLS) are two frequently used feature
extraction methods, and in the previous works, the top several components of PCA 
or PLS are selected for modeling according to the descending order of
eigenvalues. While in this paper, we prove that not all the top features are
useful, but features should be selected from all the components by feature
selection methods.
RESULTS: We demonstrate a framework for selecting feature subsets from all the
newly extracted components, leading to reduced classification error rates on the 
gene expression microarray data. Here we have considered both an unsupervised
method PCA and a supervised method PLS for extracting new components, genetic
algorithms for feature selection, and support vector machines and k nearest
neighbor for classification. Experimental results illustrate that our proposed
framework is effective to select feature subsets and to reduce classification
error rates.
CONCLUSION: Not only the top features newly extracted by PCA or PLS are
important, therefore, feature selection should be performed to select subsets
from new features to improve generalization performance of classifiers.

(1)Division of Laser Spectroscopy, Manipal Life Sciences Centre, Kasturba Medical
College, Manipal University, Manipal, India.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of
laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) data obtained at 325-nm pulsed laser excitation 
for the discrimination of normal, benign, and malignant ovarian tissues.
BACKGROUND DATA: Several studies have reported that the autofluorescence
technique has a high specificity and sensitivity for discrimination between
diseased and non-diseased tissues of various cancers, and also has the advantages
of being non-invasive and producing a real-time diagnosis. When using this
technique on ovarian tissues in most of the previously reported studies,
multivariate statistical tools were used and classification analyses were carried
out.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Autofluorescence spectra of normal, benign, and malignant 
ovarian tissues were recorded with 325-nm pulsed laser excitation in the spectral
region from 350-600 nm in vitro. The spectral analysis for discrimination between
the different types of tissues was carried out using principal component analysis
(PCA)-based non-parametric k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 97 (34 normal, 33 benign, and 30 malignant) spectra were
obtained from 22 subjects with normal, benign, and malignant tissues. The
discrimination analysis of data using a PCA-based k-NN algorithm showed very good
discrimination. The performance of the analysis was evaluated by calculating
statistical parameters, specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy and were found to 
be 100%, 90.90%, and 94.2%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The results show that the discrimination of normal, benign, and
malignant ovarian conditions can be achieved quite successfully using LIF.

of k-nearest neighbors.

Box 4500, Oulu 90014, Finland. oleg@ee.oulu.fi

OBJECTIVE: We explore the link between dataset complexity, determining how
difficult a dataset is for classification, and classification performance defined
by low-variance and low-biased bolstered resubstitution error made by k-nearest
neighbor classifiers.
METHODS AND MATERIAL: Gene expression based cancer classification is used as the 
task in this study. Six gene expression datasets containing different types of
cancer constitute test data.
RESULTS: Through extensive simulation coupled with the copula method for analysis
of association in bivariate data, we show that dataset complexity and bolstered
resubstitution error are associated in terms of dependence. As a result, we
propose a new scheme for generating ensembles of classifiers that selects subsets
of features of low complexity for ensemble members, which constitutes the
accurate members according to the found dependence relation.
CONCLUSION: Experiments with six gene expression datasets demonstrate that our
ensemble generating scheme based on the dependence of dataset complexity and
classification error is superior to a single best classifier in the ensemble and 
to the traditional ensemble construction scheme that is ignorant of dataset
complexity.

The efficacy of fluorescence spectroscopy to detect squamous cell carcinoma is
evaluated in an animal model following laser excitation at 442 and 532 nm.
Lesions are chemically induced with a topical DMBA application at the left
lateral tongue of Golden Syrian hamsters. The animals are investigated every 2
weeks after the 4th week of induction until a total of 26 weeks. The right
lateral tongue of each animal is considered as a control site (normal
contralateral tissue) and the induced lesions are analyzed as a set of points
covering the entire clinically detectable area. Based on fluorescence spectral
differences, four indices are determined to discriminate normal and carcinoma
tissues, based on intraspectral analysis. The spectral data are also analyzed
using a multivariate data analysis and the results are compared with histology as
the diagnostic gold standard. The best result achieved is for blue excitation
using the KNN (K-nearest neighbor, a interspectral analysis) algorithm with a
sensitivity of 95.7% and a specificity of 91.6%. These high indices indicate that
fluorescence spectroscopy may constitute a fast noninvasive auxiliary tool for
diagnostic of cancer within the oral cavity.

Medical data mining by fuzzy modeling with selected features.

Ghazavi SN(1), Liao TW.

Author information: 
(1)Industrial Engineering Department, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA
70803, USA.

OBJECTIVE: Medical data is often very high dimensional. Depending upon the use,
some data dimensions might be more relevant than others. In processing medical
data, choosing the optimal subset of features is such important, not only to
reduce the processing cost but also to improve the usefulness of the model built 
from the selected data. This paper presents a data mining study of medical data
with fuzzy modeling methods that use feature subsets selected by some
indices/methods.
METHODS: Specifically, three fuzzy modeling methods including the fuzzy k-nearest
neighbor algorithm, a fuzzy clustering-based modeling, and the adaptive
network-based fuzzy inference system are employed. For feature selection, a total
of 11 indices/methods are used. Medical data mined include the Wisconsin breast
cancer dataset and the Pima Indians diabetes dataset. The classification accuracy
and computational time are reported. To show how good the best performer is, the 
globally optimal was also found by carrying out an exhaustive testing of all
possible combinations of feature subsets with three features.
RESULTS: For the Wisconsin breast cancer dataset, the best accuracy of 97.17% was
obtained, which is only 0.25% lower than that was obtained by exhaustive testing.
For the Pima Indians diabetes dataset, the best accuracy of 77.65% was obtained, 
which is only 0.13% lower than that obtained by exhaustive testing.
CONCLUSION: This paper has shown that feature selection is important to mining
medical data for reducing processing time and for increasing classification
accuracy. However, not all combinations of feature selection and modeling methods
are equally effective and the best combination is often data-dependent, as
supported by the breast cancer and diabetes data analyzed in this paper.

Germany.

It is known that patients suffering from cancer diseases excrete increased
amounts of modified nucleosides with their urine. Especially methylated
nucleosides have been proposed to be potential tumor markers for early diagnosis 
of cancer. For determination of nucleosides in randomly collected urine samples, 
the nucleosides were extracted using affinity chromatography and then analyzed
via reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with
UV-detection. Eleven nucleosides were quantified in urine samples from 51 breast 
cancer patients and 65 healthy women. The measured concentrations were used to
train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a k-nearest-neighbor classifier (k-NN)
to discriminate between healthy control subjects and patients suffering from
breast cancer. Evaluations of the learned models by computing the leave-one-out
error and the prediction error on an independent test set of 29 subjects (15
healthy, 14 breast cancer patients) showed that by using the eleven nucleosides, 
the occurrence of breast cancer could be forecasted with 86% specificity and 94% 
sensitivity when using an SVM and 86% for both specificity and sensitivity with
the k-NN model.

The confocal microendoscope is an instrument for imaging the surface of the human
ovary. Images taken with this instrument from normal and diseased tissue show
significant differences in cellular distribution. A real-time computer-aided
system to facilitate the identification of ovarian cancer is introduced. The
cellular-level structure present in ex vivo confocal microendoscope images is
modeled as texture. Features are extracted based on first-order statistics,
spatial gray-level-dependence matrices, and spatial-frequency content. Selection 
of the features is performed using stepwise discriminant analysis, forward
sequential search, a nonparametric method, principal component analysis, and a
heuristic technique that combines the results of these other methods. The
selected features are used for classification, and the performance of various
machine classifiers is compared by analyzing areas under their receiver operating
characteristic curves. The machine classifiers studied included linear
discriminant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis, and the
k-nearest-neighbor algorithm. The results suggest it is possible to automatically
identify pathology based on texture features extracted from confocal
microendoscope images and that the machine performance is superior to that of a
human observer.

OBJECTIVES: To objectively identify possible differences in the signal
characteristics of benign and malignant soft tissue masses (STM) on magnetic
resonance (MR) images by means of texture analysis and to determine the value of 
these differences for computer-assisted lesion classification.
METHOD: Fifty-eight patients with histologically proven STM (benign, n=30;
malignant, n=28) were included. STM texture was analyzed on routine T1-weighted, 
T2-weighted and short tau inversion recovery (STIR) images obtained with
heterogeneous acquisition protocols. Fisher coefficients (F) and the probability 
of classification error and average correlation coefficients (POE+ACC) were
calculated to identify the most discriminative texture features for separation of
benign and malignant STM. F>1 indicated adequate discriminative power of texture 
features. Based on the texture features, computer-assisted classification of the 
STM by means of k-nearest-neighbor (k-NN) and artificial neural network (ANN)
classification was performed, and accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were
calculated.
RESULTS: Discriminative power was only adequate for two texture features, derived
from the gray-level histogram of the STIR images (first and 10th gray-level
percentiles). Accordingly, the best results of STM classification were achieved
using texture information from STIR images, with an accuracy of 75.0%
(sensitivity, 71.4%; specificity, 78.3%) for the k-NN classifier, and an accuracy
of 90.5% (sensitivity, 91.1%; specificity, 90.0%) for the ANN classifier.
CONCLUSION: Texture analysis revealed only small differences in the signal
characteristics of benign and malignant STM on routine MR images.
Computer-assisted pattern recognition algorithms may aid in the characterization 
of STM, but more data is necessary to confirm their clinical value.

Use of cell viability assay data improves the prediction accuracy of conventional
quantitative structure-activity relationship models of animal carcinogenicity.

Zhu H(1), Rusyn I, Richard A, Tropsha A.

Author information: 
(1)Carolina Environmental Bioinformatics Research Center, University of North
Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-7360, USA.

BACKGROUND: To develop efficient approaches for rapid evaluation of chemical
toxicity and human health risk of environmental compounds, the National
Toxicology Program (NTP) in collaboration with the National Center for Chemical
Genomics has initiated a project on high-throughput screening (HTS) of
environmental chemicals. The first HTS results for a set of 1,408 compounds
tested for their effects on cell viability in six different cell lines have
recently become available via PubChem.
OBJECTIVES: We have explored these data in terms of their utility for predicting 
adverse health effects of the environmental agents.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Initially, the classification k nearest neighbor (kNN)
quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling method was applied
to the HTS data only, for a curated data set of 384 compounds. The resulting
models had prediction accuracies for training, test (containing 275 compounds
together), and external validation (109 compounds) sets as high as 89%, 71%, and 
74%, respectively. We then asked if HTS results could be of value in predicting
rodent carcinogenicity. We identified 383 compounds for which data were available
from both the Berkeley Carcinogenic Potency Database and NTP-HTS studies. We
found that compounds classified by HTS as "actives" in at least one cell line
were likely to be rodent carcinogens (sensitivity 77%); however, HTS "inactives" 
were far less informative (specificity 46%). Using chemical descriptors only, kNN
QSAR modeling resulted in 62.3% prediction accuracy for rodent carcinogenicity
applied to this data set. Importantly, the prediction accuracy of the model was
significantly improved (72.7%) when chemical descriptors were augmented by HTS
data, which were regarded as biological descriptors.
CONCLUSIONS: Our studies suggest that combining NTP-HTS profiles with
conventional chemical descriptors could considerably improve the predictive power
of computational approaches in toxicology.

Application of wavelet-based neural network on DNA microarray data.

(1)Centre for Clinical Trials, School of Public Health, Department of Clinical
Oncology, the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR.

The advantage of using DNA microarray data when investigating human cancer gene
expressions is its ability to generate enormous amount of information from a
single assay in order to speed up the scientific evaluation process. The number
of variables from the gene expression data coupled with comparably much less
number of samples creates new challenges to scientists and statisticians. In
particular, the problems include enormous degree of collinearity among genes
expressions, likely violation of model assumptions as well as high level of noise
with potential outliers. To deal with these problems, we propose a block wavelet 
shrinkage principal component (BWSPCA) analysis method to optimize the
information during the noise reduction process. This paper firstly uses the
National Cancer Institute database (NC160) as an illustration and shows a
significant improvement in dimension reduction. Secondly we combine BWSPCA with
an artificial neural network-based gene minimization strategy to establish a
Block Wavelet-based Neural Network model in a robust and accurate cancer
classification process (BWNN). Our extensive experiments on six public cancer
datasets have shown that the method of BWNN for tumor classification performed
well, especially on some difficult instances with large-class (more than two)
expression data. This proposed method is extremely useful for data denoising and 
is competitiveness with respect to other methods such as BagBoost, RandomForest
(RanFor), Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Artificial 
Neural Network (ANN).

INTRODUCTION: A long-term goal of our group is to develop proteomic-based
approaches to the detection and use of protein biomarkers for improvement in
diagnosis, prognosis, and tailoring of treatment for head and neck squamous cell 
cancer (HNSCC). We have previously demonstrated that protein expression profiling
of serum can identify multiple protein biomarker events that can serve as
molecular fingerprints for the assessment of HNSCC disease state and prognosis.
METHODS: An automated Bruker Daltonics (Billerica, MA) ClinProt matrix-assisted
laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer was
used. Magnetic chemical affinity beads were used to differentially capture serum 
proteins prior to MALDI-TOF analysis. The resulting spectra were analyzed using
postprocessing software and a pattern recognition genetic algorithm (ClinProt
2.0). An HNSCC cohort of 48 sera samples from 24 patients consisting of matched
pretreatment and 6 to 12 month posttreatment samples was used for further
analysis. Low-mass differentially expressed peptides were identified using
MALDI-TOF/TOF.
RESULTS: In the working mass range of 1,000 to 10,000 m/z, approximately 200
peaks were resolved for ionic bead capture approaches. For spectra generated from
weak cation bead capture, a k-nearest neighbor genetic algorithm was able to
correctly classify 94% normal from pretreatment HNSCC samples, 80% of
pretreatment from posttreatment samples, and 87% of normal from posttreatment
samples. These peptides were then analyzed by MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectometry for 
sequence identification directly from serum processed with the same magnetic bead
chemistry or alternatively after gel electrophoresis separation of the captured
proteins. We were able to compare this with similar studies using
surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization (SELDI)-TOF to show this method as a
valid tool for this process with some improvement in the identification of our
groups.
CONCLUSIONS: This initial study using new high-resolution MALDI-TOF mass
spectrometry coupled with bead fractionation is suitable for automated protein
profiling and has the capability to simultaneously identify potential biomarker
proteins for HNSCC. In addition, we were able to show improvement with the
MALDI-TOF in identifying groups with HNSCC when compared with our prior data
using SELDI-TOF. Using this MALDI-TOF technology as a discovery platform, we
anticipate generating biomarker panels for use in more accurate prediction of
prognosis and treatment efficacies for HNSCC.

Gene expression profiles, which represent the state of a cell at a molecular
level, have great potential as a medical diagnosis tool. Compared to the number
of genes involved, available training data sets generally have a fairly small
sample size in cancer type classification. These training data limitations
constitute a challenge to certain classification methodologies. A reliable
selection method for genes relevant for sample classification is needed in order 
to speed up the processing rate, decrease the predictive error rate, and to avoid
incomprehensibility due to the large number of genes investigated. Improved
binary particle swarm optimization (IBPSO) is used in this study to implement
feature selection, and the K-nearest neighbor (K-NN) method serves as an
evaluator of the IBPSO for gene expression data classification problems.
Experimental results show that this method effectively simplifies feature
selection and reduces the total number of features needed. The classification
accuracy obtained by the proposed method has the highest classification accuracy 
in nine of the 11 gene expression data test problems, and is comparative to the
classification accuracy of the two other test problems, as compared to the best
results previously published.

Hormone receptors have been used in prognosis of breast carcinomas and their
positive status is of clinical value in hormonal therapy. Determination of this
status is based on the subjective visual inspection of the stained nuclei in the 
specimens. The aim of this study was the assessment of the estrogen receptor's
(ER) positive status of breast carcinomas, by means of colour-texture based image
analysis methodology. Twenty two cases of immunohistochemically (IHC) stained
breast biopsies were initially assessed by a histopathologist for ER positive
status, following a clinical scoring protocol. Custom-designed image analysis
software was developed for automatically assessing the ER positive status,
employing colour textural features and the k-Nearest Neighbor weighted votes
classification algorithm. Computer-based image analysis system resulted in 86.4% 
overall accuracy and in 0.875 Kendall's coefficient of concordance (p<0.001),
ranking correctly 19/22 cases. Colour-texture analysis of IHC stained specimens
might have an impact in the quantitative assessment of ER status.

Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66045, USA. hlxiong@ittc.ku.edu

One important application of gene expression analysis is to classify tissue
samples according to their gene expression levels. Gene expression data are
typically characterized by high dimensionality and small sample size, which makes
the classification task quite challenging. In this paper, we present a
data-dependent kernel for microarray data classification. This kernel function is
engineered so that the class separability of the training data is maximized. A
bootstrapping-based resampling scheme is introduced to reduce the possible
training bias. The effectiveness of this adaptive kernel for microarray data
classification is illustrated with a k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifier. Our
experimental study shows that the data-dependent kernel leads to a significant
improvement in the accuracy of KNN classifiers. Furthermore, this kernel-based
KNN scheme has been demonstrated to be competitive to, if not better than, more
sophisticated classifiers such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and the
Uncorrelated Linear Discriminant Analysis (ULDA) for classifying gene expression 
data.

We present a study of image features for cancer diagnosis and Gleason grading of 
the histological images of prostate. In diagnosis, the tissue image is classified
into the tumor and nontumor classes. In Gleason grading, which characterizes
tumor aggressiveness, the image is classified as containing a low- or high-grade 
tumor. The image sets used in this paper consisted of 367 and 268 color images
for the diagnosis and Gleason grading problems, respectively, and were captured
from representative areas of hematoxylin and eosin-stained tissue retrieved from 
tissue microarray cores or whole sections. The primary contribution of this paper
is to aggregate color, texture, and morphometric cues at the global and
histological object levels for classification. Features representing different
visual cues were combined in a supervised learning framework. We compared the
performance of Gaussian, k-nearest neighbor, and support vector machine
classifiers together with the sequential forward feature selection algorithm. On 
diagnosis, using a five-fold cross-validation estimate, an accuracy of 96.7% was 
obtained. On Gleason grading, the achieved accuracy of classification into low-
and high-grade classes was 81.0%.

Ground glass opacity (GGO) is defined as hazy increased attenuation within a lung
that is not associated with obscured underlying vessels. Since pure (non-solid)
or mixed (partially solid) GGO at the thin-section CT are more likely to be
malignant than those with solid opacity, early detection and treatment of GGO can
improve a prognosis of lung cancer. However, due to indistinct boundaries and
inter-or intra-observer variation, consistent manual detection and segmentation
of GGO have proved to be problematic. In this paper, we propose a novel method
for automatic detection and segmentation of GGO from chest CT images. For GGO
detection, we develop a classifier by boosting k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), whose
distance measure is the Euclidean distance between the nonparametric density
estimates of two regions. The detected GGO region is then automatically segmented
by analyzing the 3D texture likelihood map of the region. We applied our method
to clinical chest CT volumes containing 10 GGO nodules. The proposed method
detected all of the 10 nodules with only one false positive nodule. We also
present the statistical validation of the proposed classifier for automatic GGO
detection as well as very promising results for automatic GGO segmentation. The
proposed method provides a new powerful tool for automatic detection as well as
accurate and reproducible segmentation of GGO.

Support vector machine (SVM) has shown its excellent learning and generalization 
ability for the binary classification of real problems and has been extensively
employed in many areas. In this paper, SVM, K-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree
C4.5 and Artificial Neural Network were applied to identify cancer patients and
normal individuals using the concentrations of 6 elements including macroelements
(Ca, Mg) and microelements (Ba, Cu, Se, Zn) in human blood. It was demonstrated, 
by using the normalized features instead of the original features, the
classification performances can be improved from 91.89% to 95.95%, from 83.78% to
93.24%, and from 90.54% to 94.59% for SVM, K-NN and ANN respectively, whereas
that of C4.5 keeps unchangeable. The best average accuracy of SVM with linear dot
kernel by using 5-fold cross validation reaches 95.95%, and is superior to those 
of other classifiers based on K-NN (93.24%), C4.5 (79.73%), and ANN (94.59%). The
study suggests that support vector machine is capable of being used as a
potential application methodology for SVM-aided clinical cancer diagnosis.

Interactive computer-aided diagnosis of breast masses: computerized selection of 
visually similar image sets from a reference library.

RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The clinical utility of interactive computer-aided
diagnosis (ICAD) systems depends on clinical relevance and visual similarity
between the queried breast lesions and the ICAD-selected reference regions. The
objective of this study is to develop and test a new ICAD scheme that aims
improve visual similarity of ICAD-selected reference regions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A large and diverse reference library involving 3,000
regions of interests was established. For each queried breast mass lesion by the 
observer, the ICAD scheme segments the lesion, classifies its boundary
spiculation level, and computes 14 image features representing the segmented
lesion and its surrounding tissue background. A conditioned k-nearest neighbor
algorithm is applied to select a set of the 25 most "similar" lesions from the
reference library. After computing the mutual information between the queried
lesion and each of these initially selected 25 lesions, the scheme displays the
six reference lesions with the highest mutual information scores. To evaluate the
automated selection process of the six "visually similar" lesions to the queried 
lesion, we conducted a two-alternative forced-choice observer preference study
using 85 queried mass lesions. Two sets of reference lesions selected by one new 
automated ICAD scheme and the other previously reported scheme using a subjective
rating method were randomly displayed on the left and right side of the queried
lesion. Nine observers were asked to decide for each of the 85 queried lesions
which one of the two reference sets was "more visually similar" to the queried
lesion.
RESULTS: In classification of mass boundary spiculation levels, the overall
agreement rate between the automated scheme and an observer is 58.8% (Kappa =
0.31). In observer preference study, the nine observers preferred on average the 
reference lesion sets selected by the automated scheme as being more visually
similar than the set selected by the subjective rating approach in 53.2% of the
queried lesions. The results were not significantly different for the two methods
(P = .128).
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that using the new automated ICAD scheme, the
interobserver variability related issues can thus be avoided. Furthermore, the
new scheme maintains the similar performance level as the previous scheme using
the subjective rating method that can select reference sets that are
significantly more visually similar (P < .05) than when using traditional ICAD
schemes in which the mass boundary spiculation levels are not accurately detected
and quantified.

Non-linear dimensionality reduction of signaling networks.

BACKGROUND: Systems wide modeling and analysis of signaling networks is essential
for understanding complex cellular behaviors, such as the biphasic responses to
different combinations of cytokines and growth factors. For example, tumor
necrosis factor (TNF) can act as a proapoptotic or prosurvival factor depending
on its concentration, the current state of signaling network and the presence of 
other cytokines. To understand combinatorial regulation in such systems, new
computational approaches are required that can take into account non-linear
interactions in signaling networks and provide tools for clustering,
visualization and predictive modeling.
RESULTS: Here we extended and applied an unsupervised non-linear dimensionality
reduction approach, Isomap, to find clusters of similar treatment conditions in
two cell signaling networks: (I) apoptosis signaling network in human epithelial 
cancer cells treated with different combinations of TNF, epidermal growth factor 
(EGF) and insulin and (II) combination of signal transduction pathways stimulated
by 21 different ligands based on AfCS double ligand screen data. For the analysis
of the apoptosis signaling network we used the Cytokine compendium dataset where 
activity and concentration of 19 intracellular signaling molecules were measured 
to characterise apoptotic response to TNF, EGF and insulin. By projecting the
original 19-dimensional space of intracellular signals into a low-dimensional
space, Isomap was able to reconstruct clusters corresponding to different
cytokine treatments that were identified with graph-based clustering. In
comparison, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Partial Least Squares -
Discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) were unable to find biologically meaningful
clusters. We also showed that by using Isomap components for supervised
classification with k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) and quadratic discriminant analysis
(QDA), apoptosis intensity can be predicted for different combinations of TNF,
EGF and insulin. Prediction accuracy was highest when early activation time
points in the apoptosis signaling network were used to predict apoptosis rates at
later time points. Extended Isomap also outperformed PCA on the AfCS double
ligand screen data. Isomap identified more functionally coherent clusters than
PCA and captured more information in the first two-components. The Isomap
projection performs slightly worse when more signaling networks are analyzed;
suggesting that the mapping function between cues and responses becomes
increasingly non-linear when large signaling pathways are considered.
CONCLUSION: We developed and applied extended Isomap approach for the analysis of
cell signaling networks. Potential biological applications of this method include
characterization, visualization and clustering of different treatment conditions 
(i.e. low and high doses of TNF) in terms of changes in intracellular signaling
they induce.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory arthritis. Currently,
diagnosis of RA may take several weeks, and factors used to predict a poor
prognosis are not always reliable. Gene expression in RA may consist of a unique 
signature. Gene expression analysis has been applied to synovial tissue to define
molecularly distinct forms of RA; however, expression analysis of tissue taken
from a synovial joint is invasive and clinically impractical. Recent studies have
demonstrated that unique gene expression changes can be identified in peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with cancer, multiple sclerosis,
and lupus. To identify RA disease-related genes, we performed a global gene
expression analysis. RNA from PBMCs of 9 RA patients and 13 normal volunteers was
analyzed on an oligonucleotide array. Compared with normal PBMCs, 330 transcripts
were differentially expressed in RA. The differentially regulated genes belong to
diverse functional classes and include genes involved in calcium binding,
chaperones, cytokines, transcription, translation, signal transduction,
extracellular matrix, integral to plasma membrane, integral to intracellular
membrane, mitochondrial, ribosomal, structural, enzymes, and proteases. A
k-nearest neighbor analysis identified 29 transcripts that were preferentially
expressed in RA. Ten genes with increased expression in RA PBMCs compared with
controls mapped to a RA susceptibility locus, 6p21.3. These results suggest that 
analysis of RA PBMCs at the molecular level may provide a set of candidate genes 
that could yield an easily accessible gene signature to aid in early diagnosis
and treatment.

Gene expression analyses were performed on 121 consecutive childhood leukemias
(87 B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALLs), 11 T-cell ALLs and 23 acute
myeloid leukemias (AMLs)), investigated during an 8-year period at a single
center. The supervised learning algorithm k-nearest neighbor was utilized to
build gene expression predictors that could classify the ALLs/AMLs according to
clinically important subtypes with high accuracy. Validation experiments in an
independent data set verified the high prediction accuracies of our classifiers. 
B-lineage ALLs with uncharacteristic cytogenetic aberrations or with a normal
karyotype displayed heterogeneous gene expression profiles, resulting in low
prediction accuracies. Minimal residual disease status (MRD) in T-cell ALLs with 
a high (>0.1%) MRD at day 29 could be classified with 100% accuracy already at
the time of diagnosis. In pediatric leukemias with uncharacteristic cytogenetic
aberrations or with a normal karyotype, unsupervised analysis identified two
novel subgroups: one consisting mainly of cases remaining in complete remission
(CR) and one containing a few patients in CR and all but one of the patients who 
relapsed. This study of a consecutive series of childhood leukemias confirms and 
extends further previous reports demonstrating that global gene expression
profiling provides a valuable tool for genetic and clinical classification of
childhood leukemias.

BACKGROUND: Automated identification of cell cycle phases of individual live
cells in a large population captured via automated fluorescence microscopy
technique is important for cancer drug discovery and cell cycle studies.
Time-lapse fluorescence microscopy images provide an important method to study
the cell cycle process under different conditions of perturbation. Existing
methods are limited in dealing with such time-lapse data sets while manual
analysis is not feasible. This paper presents statistical data analysis and
statistical pattern recognition to perform this task.
RESULTS: The data is generated from Hela H2B GFP cells imaged during a 2-day
period with images acquired 15 minutes apart using an automated time-lapse
fluorescence microscopy. The patterns are described with four kinds of features, 
including twelve general features, Haralick texture features, Zernike moment
features, and wavelet features. To generate a new set of features with more
discriminate power, the commonly used feature reduction techniques are used,
which include Principle Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis
(LDA), Maximum Margin Criterion (MMC), Stepwise Discriminate Analysis based
Feature Selection (SDAFS), and Genetic Algorithm based Feature Selection (GAFS). 
Then, we propose a Context Based Mixture Model (CBMM) for dealing with the
time-series cell sequence information and compare it to other traditional
classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Network (NN), and K-Nearest
Neighbor (KNN). Being a standard practice in machine learning, we systematically 
compare the performance of a number of common feature reduction techniques and
classifiers to select an optimal combination of a feature reduction technique and
a classifier. A cellular database containing 100 manually labelled subsequence is
built for evaluating the performance of the classifiers. The generalization error
is estimated using the cross validation technique. The experimental results show 
that CBMM outperforms all other classifies in identifying prophase and has the
best overall performance.
CONCLUSION: The application of feature reduction techniques can improve the
prediction accuracy significantly. CBMM can effectively utilize the contextual
information and has the best overall performance when combined with any of the
previously mentioned feature reduction techniques.

PURPOSE: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is associated with a high risk of colorectal
cancer. To identify genes that could predict the development of cancer in UC, we 
conducted a DNA microarray analysis using nonneoplastic rectal mucosa of UC
patients.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Gene expression in nonneoplastic mucosa of 53 UC patients
were examined. Gene expression profiles were examined using human Genome U133
Plus 2.0 gene chip array (Affymetrix). Among 53 UC patients, 10 had UC-associated
cancer (UC-Ca group) whereas 43 did not (UC-NonCa group).
RESULTS: By comparing gene expression profiles of nonneoplastic rectal mucosae
between the UC-Ca and UC-NonCa groups, we could identify 40 genes that were
differentially expressed between two groups. The list of discriminating genes
included low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP5 and LRP6).
Previous studies suggested that LRP5 and LRP6 expression promotes cancer cell
proliferation and tumorigenesis and are considered as candidate oncogenes. In the
present study, both LRP5 and LRP6 showed significantly higher expression in the
UC-Ca group, which suggests the importance of these genes in the development of
UC-associated colorectal cancers. With the 40 selected discriminating genes, we
did class prediction of the development of colorectal neoplasms in UC patients.
Using the k-nearest neighbor method and the support vector machine, we could
predict the development of UC-associated neoplasms with an accuracy of 86.8% and 
98.1%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings have important implications for the early detection
of malignant lesions in UC and may provide directions for future research into
the molecular mechanisms of UC-associated cancer.

A gene expression profile for vascular invasion can predict the recurrence after 
resection of hepatocellular carcinoma: a microarray approach.

Road, Taipei, 100, Taiwan.

BACKGROUND: Recurrence after hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) resection is the
major obstacle to improved survival. The presence of vascular invasion (VI) in
pathology specimens is a well-known unfavorable prognostic factor for HCC
recurrence. Though some VI-related genes have been reported, their association
with recurrence-free survival is not known. We hypothesized that a gene
expression profile for VI can predict the recurrence of HCC after liver
resection.
METHODS: Eighteen patients receiving complete HCC resection were included as a
"training group". Genome-wide gene expression profile was obtained for each tumor
using a microarray technique. Datasets were subjected to clustering analysis
supervised by the presence or absence of VI to obtain 14 discriminative genes. We
then applied those genes to execute pattern recognition using the k-Nearest
Neighbor (KNN) classification method, and the best model for this VI gene
signature to predict recurrence-free survival in the training group was obtained.
The resulting model was then tested in an independent "test group" of 35
patients.
RESULTS: A 14-gene profile was extracted which could accurately separate ten
patients with VI and eight patients without VI in the "training group". In the
"test group", significant difference in disease-free survival was found between
patients predicted to have and not to have recurrence (P = .02823). In patients
with stage_I disease, this model can also predict outcomes (P = .000205).
CONCLUSIONS: Using the 14-gene expression profile extracted from microarrays
based on the presence of VI can effectively predict recurrence after HCC
resection. This approach might facilitate "personalized medicine" for HCC
patients after surgical resection.

Centre, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.

We analysed 148 primary breast cancers using BAC-arrays containing 287 clones
representing cancer-related gene/loci to obtain genomic molecular portraits.
Gains were detected in 136 tumors (91.9%) and losses in 123 tumors (83.1%). Eight
tumors (5.4%) did not have any genomic aberrations in the 281 clones analysed.
Common (more than 15% of the samples) gains were observed at 8q11-qtel,
1q21-qtel, 17q11-q12 and 11q13, whereas common losses were observed at
16q12-qtel, 11ptel-p15.5, 1p36-ptel, 17p11.2-p12 and 8ptel-p22. Patients with
tumors registering either less than 5% (median value) or less than 11% (third
quartile) total copy number changes had a better overall survival (log-rank test:
P=0.0417 and P=0.0375, respectively). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering based 
on copy number changes identified four clusters. Women with tumors from the
cluster with amplification of three regions containing known breast oncogenes
(11q13, 17q12 and 20q13) had a worse prognosis. The good prognosis group
(Nottingham Prognostic Index (NPI) <or=3.4) tumors had frequent loss of
16q24-qtel. Genes significantly associated with estrogen receptor (ER), Grade and
NPI were used to build k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifiers that predicted ER,
Grade and NPI status in the test set with an average misclassification rate of
24.7, 25.7 and 35.7%, respectively. These data raise the prospect of generating a
molecular taxonomy of breast cancer based on copy number profiling using tumor
DNA, which may be more generally applicable than expression microarray analysis.

cancer from gene expression based on boosting and projective adaptive resonance
theory.

Esophageal cancer is a well-known cancer with poorer prognosis than other
cancers. An optimal and individualized treatment protocol based on accurate
diagnosis is urgently needed to improve the treatment of cancer patients. For
this purpose, it is important to develop a sophisticated algorithm that can
manage a large amount of data, such as gene expression data from DNA microarrays,
for optimal and individualized diagnosis. Marker gene selection is essential in
the analysis of gene expression data. We have already developed a combination
method of the use of the projective adaptive resonance theory and that of a
boosted fuzzy classifier with the SWEEP operator denoted PART-BFCS. This method
is superior to other methods, and has four features, namely fast calculation,
accurate prediction, reliable prediction, and rule extraction. In this study, we 
applied this method to analyze microarray data obtained from esophageal cancer
patients. A combination method of PART-BFCS and the U-test was also investigated.
It was necessary to use a specific type of BFCS, namely, BFCS-1,2, because the
esophageal cancer data were very complexity. PART-BFCS and PART-BFCS with the
U-test models showed higher performances than two conventional methods, namely,
k-nearest neighbor (kNN) and weighted voting (WV). The genes including CDK6 could
be found by our methods and excellent IF-THEN rules could be extracted. The genes
selected in this study have a high potential as new diagnosis markers for
esophageal cancer. These results indicate that the new methods can be used in
marker gene selection for the diagnosis of cancer patients.

What should be expected from feature selection in small-sample settings.

Sima C(1), Dougherty ER.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A&M University,
College Station, TX 77843, USA.

MOTIVATION: High-throughput technologies for rapid measurement of vast numbers of
biological variables offer the potential for highly discriminatory diagnosis and 
prognosis; however, high dimensionality together with small samples creates the
need for feature selection, while at the same time making feature-selection
algorithms less reliable. Feature selection must typically be carried out from
among thousands of gene-expression features and in the context of a small sample 
(small number of microarrays). Two basic questions arise: (1) Can one expect
feature selection to yield a feature set whose error is close to that of an
optimal feature set? (2) If a good feature set is not found, should it be
expected that good feature sets do not exist?
RESULTS: The two questions translate quantitatively into questions concerning
conditional expectation. (1) Given the error of an optimal feature set, what is
the conditionally expected error of the selected feature set? (2) Given the error
of the selected feature set, what is the conditionally expected error of the
optimal feature set? We address these questions using three classification rules 
(linear discriminant analysis, linear support vector machine and
k-nearest-neighbor classification) and feature selection via sequential floating 
forward search and the t-test. We consider three feature-label models and patient
data from a study concerning survival prognosis for breast cancer. With regard to
the two focus questions, there is similarity across all experiments: (1) One
cannot expect to find a feature set whose error is close to optimal, and (2) the 
inability to find a good feature set should not lead to the conclusion that good 
feature sets do not exist. In practice, the latter conclusion may be more
immediately relevant, since when faced with the common occurrence that a feature 
set discovered from the data does not give satisfactory results, the experimenter
can draw no conclusions regarding the existence or nonexistence of suitable
feature sets.

Standard classification algorithms are generally designed to maximize the number 
of correct predictions (concordance). The criterion of maximizing the concordance
may not be appropriate in certain applications. In practice, some applications
may emphasize high sensitivity (e.g., clinical diagnostic tests) and others may
emphasize high specificity (e.g., epidemiology screening studies). This paper
considers effects of the decision threshold on sensitivity, specificity, and
concordance for four classification methods: logistic regression, classification 
tree, Fisher's linear discriminant analysis, and a weighted k-nearest neighbor.
We investigated the use of decision threshold adjustment to improve performance
of either sensitivity or specificity of a classifier under specific conditions.
We conducted a Monte Carlo simulation showing that as the decision threshold
increases, the sensitivity decreases and the specificity increases; but, the
concordance values in an interval around the maximum concordance are similar. For
specified sensitivity and specificity levels, an optimal decision threshold might
be determined in an interval around the maximum concordance that meets the
specified requirement. Three example data sets were analyzed for illustrations.

MOTIVATION: Microarrays datasets frequently contain a large number of missing
values (MVs), which need to be estimated and replaced for subsequent data mining.
The focus of the paper is to study the effects of different MV treatments for
cDNA microarray data on disease classification analysis.
RESULTS: By analyzing five datasets, we demonstrate that among three kinds of
classifiers evaluated in this study, support vector machine (SVM) classifiers are
robust to varied MV imputation methods [e.g. replacing MVs by zero, K
nearest-neighbor (KNN) imputation algorithm, local least square imputation and
Bayesian principal component analysis], while the classification and regression
tree classifiers are sensitive in terms of classification accuracy. The
KNNclassifiers built on differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are robust to the
varied MV treatments, but the performances of the KNN classifiers based on all
measured genes can be significantly deteriorated when imputing MVs for genes with
larger missing rate (MR) (e.g. MR > 5%). Generally, while replacing MVs by zero
performs relatively poor, the other imputation algorithms have little difference 
in affecting classification performances of the SVM or KNN classifiers. We
further demonstrate the power and feasibility of our recently proposed functional
expression profile (FEP) approach as means to handle microarray data with MVs.
The FEPs, which are derived from the functional modules that are enriched with
sets of DEGs and thus can be consistently identified under varied MV treatments, 
achieve precise disease classification with better biological interpretation. We 
conclude that the choice of MV treatments should be determined in context of the 
later approaches used for disease classification. The suggested exclusion
criterion of ignoring the genes with larger MR (e.g. >5%), while justifiable for 
some classifiers such as KNN classifiers, might not be considered as a general
rule for all classifiers.

BACKGROUND: The most fundamental task using gene expression data in clinical
oncology is to classify tissue samples according to their gene expression levels.
Compared with traditional pattern classifications, gene expression-based data
classification is typically characterized by high dimensionality and small sample
size, which make the task quite challenging.
RESULTS: In this paper, we present a modified K-nearest-neighbor (KNN) scheme,
which is based on learning an adaptive distance metric in the data space, for
cancer classification using microarray data. The distance metric, derived from
the procedure of a data-dependent kernel optimization, can substantially increase
the class separability of the data and, consequently, lead to a significant
improvement in the performance of the KNN classifier. Intensive experiments show 
that the performance of the proposed kernel-based KNN scheme is competitive to
those of some sophisticated classifiers such as support vector machines (SVMs)
and the uncorrelated linear discriminant analysis (ULDA) in classifying the gene 
expression data.
CONCLUSION: A novel distance metric is developed and incorporated into the KNN
scheme for cancer classification. This metric can substantially increase the
class separability of the data in the feature space and, hence, lead to a
significant improvement in the performance of the KNN classifier.

Maximizing sensitivity in medical diagnosis using biased minimax probability
machine.

The challenging task of medical diagnosis based on machine learning techniques
requires an inherent bias, i.e., the diagnosis should favor the "ill" class over 
the "healthy" class, since misdiagnosing a patient as a healthy person may delay 
the therapy and aggravate the illness. Therefore, the objective in this task is
not to improve the overall accuracy of the classification, but to focus on
improving the sensitivity (the accuracy of the "ill" class) while maintaining an 
acceptable specificity (the accuracy of the "healthy" class). Some current
methods adopt roundabout ways to impose a certain bias toward the important
class, i.e., they try to utilize some intermediate factors to influence the
classification. However, it remains uncertain whether these methods can improve
the classification performance systematically. In this paper, by engaging a novel
learning tool, the biased minimax probability machine (BMPM), we deal with the
issue in a more elegant way and directly achieve the objective of appropriate
medical diagnosis. More specifically, the BMPM directly controls the worst case
accuracies to incorporate a bias toward the "ill" class. Moreover, in a
distribution-free way, the BMPM derives the decision rule in such a way as to
maximize the worst case sensitivity while maintaining an acceptable worst case
specificity. By directly controlling the accuracies, the BMPM provides a more
rigorous way to handle medical diagnosis; by deriving a distribution-free
decision rule, the BMPM distinguishes itself from a large family of classifiers, 
namely, the generative classifiers, where an assumption on the data distribution 
is necessary. We evaluate the performance of the model and compare it with three 
traditional classifiers: the k-nearest neighbor, the naive Bayesian, and the
C4.5. The test results on two medical datasets, the breast-cancer dataset and the
heart disease dataset, show that the BMPM outperforms the other three models.

The Rho family of small GTPases is essential for morphological changes during
normal cell development and migration, as well as during disease states such as
cancer. Our goal is to identify novel effectors of Rho proteins using a
cell-based assay for Rho activity to perform genome-wide functional screens using
double stranded RNA (dsRNAs) interference. We aim to discover genes could cause
the cell phenotype changed dramatically. Biologists currently attempt to perform 
the genome-wide RNAi screening to identify various image phenotypes. RNAi
genome-wide screening, however, could easily generate more than a million of
images per study, manual analysis is thus prohibitive. Image analysis becomes a
bottleneck in realizing high content imaging screens. We propose a two-step
segmentation approach to solve this problem. First, we determine the center of a 
cell using the information in the DNA-channel by segmenting the DNA nuclei and
the dissimilarity function is employed to attenuate the over-segmentation
problem, then we estimate a rough boundary for each cell using a polygon. Second,
we apply fuzzy c-means based multi-threshold segmentation and sharpening
technology; for isolation of touching spots, marker-controlled watershed is
employed to remove touching cells. Furthermore, Voronoi diagrams are employed to 
correct the segmentation errors caused by overlapping cells. Image features are
extracted for each cell. K-nearest neighbor classifier (KNN) is employed to
perform cell phenotype classification. Experimental results indicate that the
proposed approach can be used to identify cell phenotypes of RNAi genome-wide
screens.

Environmental and occupational exposure to asbestos is among the established risk
factors for lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United
States. This link between exposure to asbestos and the excessive death rate from 
lung cancer was evident in a study of former workers of an asbestos pipe
insulation manufacturing plant in Tyler, TX. We performed comparative proteomic
profiling of plasma samples that were collected from nine patients within 12
months before death and their age-, race- and exposure-matched disease-free
controls on strong anion exchange chips using surface-enhanced laser desorption
ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. A distance-dependent K-nearest
neighbor (KNN) classification algorithm identified spectral features of m/z
values 7558.9 and 15103.0 that were able to distinguish lung cancer patients from
disease-free individuals with high sensitivity and specificity. The high
correlation between the intensities of these two peaks (r=0.987) strongly
suggests that they are the doubly and singly charged ions of the same protein
product. Examination of these proteomic markers in the plasma samples of subjects
from >5 years before death from lung cancer suggested that they are related to
the early development of lung cancer. Validation of these biomarkers would have
significant implications for the early detection of lung cancer and better
management of high-risk patients.

Mutual information-based feature selection in studying perturbation of dendritic 
structure caused by TSC2 inactivation.

Author information: 
(1)HCNR -- Center for Bioinformatics, Harvard Medical School, Boston,
Massachusetts 02215, USA.

In this study, the effect of protein Tuberous sclerosis 2 (TSC2) on the dendritic
spine density and length was demonstrated by using TSC2-RNAinactivation. In
addition, the role of rapamycin, an antagonist of the molecular target of
rapamycin, in the morphological changes of spine caused by TSC2 silencing was
investigated. The features were extracted from highresolution three-dimensional
image stacks collected by two-photon laser scanning microscopy of green
fluorescing pyramidal cells expressing TSC2-RNA interference (RNAi), or TSC2-RNAi
and rapamycin treatment in rat hippocampal slice cultures. We proposed to apply
the lognormal distribution method for feature extraction. The extracted features 
of three cases under investigation, namely, (1) green-fluorescent protein GFP vs 
TSC2-RNAi, (2) GFP vs TSC2-RNAi and rapamycin, and (3) TSC2-RNAi vs TSC2-RNAi and
rapamycin, were analyzed by mutual information-based feature selection and
evaluated by three classifiers, K-nearest neighbor, Perceptron, and two-layer
neural networks. The results showed that both the spine density and length have
significant morphological changes after TSC2-RNAi treatment. However, rapamycin
treatment could reverse the effect of TSC2-RNAi on spine length but not on spine 
density. These results are consistent with the results reported in the scientific
literature. Finally, we explored the application of pattern recognition method in
a small sample with richer feature properties, namely bootstrap mutual
information estimation and a mutual information- based feature selection method.

CONTEXT: Correct diagnosis of the tissue origin of a metastatic cancer is the
first step in disease management, but it is frequently difficult using standard
pathologic methods. Microarray-based gene expression profiling has shown great
promise as a new tool to address this challenge.
OBJECTIVE: Adoption of microarray technologies in the clinic remains limited. We 
aimed to bridge this technological gap by developing a real-time quantitative
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay.
DESIGN: We constructed a microarray database of 466 frozen and 112
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples of both primary and metastatic
tumors, measuring expression of 22,000 genes. From the microarray database, we
used a genetic algorithm to search for gene combinations optimal for multitumor
classification. A 92-gene RT-PCR assay was then designed and used to generate a
database for 481 frozen and 119 FFPE tumor samples.
RESULTS: The microarray-based K-nearest neighbor classifier demonstrated 84%
accuracy in classifying 39 tumor types via cross-validation and 82% accuracy in
predicting 112 independent FFPE samples. We successfully translated the
microarray database to the RT-PCR platform, which allowed an overall success rate
of 87% in classifying 32 different tumor classes in the validation set of 119
FFPE tumor samples.
CONCLUSIONS: The RT-PCR-based expression assay involving 92 genes represents a
powerful tool for accurately and objectively identifying the site of origin for
metastatic tumors, especially in the cases of cancer of unknown primary. The
assay uses RT-PCR and routine FFPE samples, making it suitable for rapid clinical
adoption.

Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77230-1439, USA.

PURPOSE: The goals of this analysis were to (a) determine concordance of gene
expression results from replicate experiments, (b) examine prediction agreement
of multigene predictors on replicate data, and (c) assess the robustness of
prediction results in the face of noise.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Affymetrix U133A gene chips were used for gene expression
profiling of 97 fine-needle aspiration biopsies from breast cancer. Thirty-five
cases were profiled in replicates: 17 within the same laboratory, 11 in two
different laboratories, and 15 to assess manual and robotic labeling. We used
data from 62 cases to develop 111 distinct pharmacogenomic predictors of response
to therapy. These were tested on cases profiled in duplicates to determine
prediction agreement and accuracy. To evaluate the robustness of the
pharmacogenomic predictors, we also introduced random noise into the informative 
genes in one half of the replicates.
RESULTS: The average concordance correlation coefficient was 0.978 (range,
0.96-0.99) for intralaboratory replicates, 0.962 (range, 0.94-0.98) for
between-laboratory replicates, and 0.971 (range, 0.93-0.99) for manual versus
robotic labeling. The mean % prediction agreement on replicate data was 97% (95% 
CI, 0.96-0.98; SD, 0.006), 92% (95% CI, 0.90-0.93; SD, 0.009), and 94% (95% CI,
0.92-0.95; SD, 0.008) for support vector machines, diagonal linear discriminant
analysis, and k-nearest neighbor prediction methods, respectively. Mean accuracy 
in the test set was 77% (95% CI, 0.74-0.79; SD, 0.014), 66% (95% CI, 0.63-0.73;
SD, 0.015), and 64% (95% CI, 0.60-0.67; SD, 0.016), respectively.
CONCLUSION: Gene expression results obtained with Affymetrix U133A chips are
highly reproducible within and across two high-volume laboratories.
Pharmacogenomic predictions yielded >90% agreement in replicate data.

Specific estrogen receptor (ER) agonists have been used for hormone replacement
therapy, contraception, osteoporosis prevention, and prostate cancer treatment.
Some ER agonists and partial-agonists induce cancer and endocrine function
disruption. Methods for predicting ER agonists are useful for facilitating drug
discovery and chemical safety evaluation. Structure-activity relationships and
rule-based decision forest models have been derived for predicting ER binders at 
impressive accuracies of 87.1-97.6% for ER binders and 80.2-96.0% for ER
non-binders. However, these are not designed for identifying ER agonists and they
were developed from a subset of known ER binders. This work explored several
statistical learning methods (support vector machines, k-nearest neighbor,
probabilistic neural network and C4.5 decision tree) for predicting ER agonists
from comprehensive set of known ER agonists and other compounds. The
corresponding prediction systems were developed and tested by using 243 ER
agonists and 463 ER non-agonists, respectively, which are significantly larger in
number and structural diversity than those in previous studies. A feature
selection method was used for selecting molecular descriptors responsible for
distinguishing ER agonists from non-agonists, some of which are consistent with
those used in other studies and the findings from X-ray crystallography data. The
prediction accuracies of these methods are comparable to those of earlier studies
despite the use of significantly more diverse range of compounds. SVM gives the
best accuracy of 88.9% for ER agonists and 98.1% for non-agonists. Our study
suggests that statistical learning methods such as SVM are potentially useful for
facilitating the prediction of ER agonists and for characterizing the molecular
descriptors associated with ER agonists.

RNA secondary structure prediction from sequence alignments using a network of
k-nearest neighbor classifiers.

(1)Basic Research Program, SAIC-Frederick, Inc, National Cancer
Institute-Frederick, MD 21702, USA.

We present a machine learning method (a hierarchical network of k-nearest
neighbor classifiers) that uses an RNA sequence alignment in order to predict a
consensus RNA secondary structure. The input to the network is the mutual
information, the fraction of complementary nucleotides, and a novel consensus
RNAfold secondary structure prediction of a pair of alignment columns and its
nearest neighbors. Given this input, the network computes a prediction as to
whether a particular pair of alignment columns corresponds to a base pair. By
using a comprehensive test set of 49 RFAM alignments, the program KNetFold
achieves an average Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.81. This is a
significant improvement compared with the secondary structure prediction methods 
PFOLD and RNAalifold. By using the example of archaeal RNase P, we show that the 
program can also predict pseudoknot interactions.

University, Hsinchu, Taiwan. syho@mail.nctu.edu.tw

An accurate classifier with linguistic interpretability using a small number of
relevant genes is beneficial to microarray data analysis and development of
inexpensive diagnostic tests. Several frequently used techniques for designing
classifiers of microarray data, such as support vector machine, neural networks, 
k-nearest neighbor, and logistic regression model, suffer from low
interpretabilities. This paper proposes an interpretable gene expression
classifier (named iGEC) with an accurate and compact fuzzy rule base for
microarray data analysis. The design of iGEC has three objectives to be
simultaneously optimized: maximal classification accuracy, minimal number of
rules, and minimal number of used genes. An "intelligent" genetic algorithm IGA
is used to efficiently solve the design problem with a large number of tuning
parameters. The performance of iGEC is evaluated using eight commonly-used data
sets. It is shown that iGEC has an accurate, concise, and interpretable rule base
(1.1 rules per class) on average in terms of test classification accuracy
(87.9%), rule number (3.9), and used gene number (5.0). Moreover, iGEC not only
has better performance than the existing fuzzy rule-based classifier in terms of 
the above-mentioned objectives, but also is more accurate than some existing
non-rule-based classifiers.

The purpose of this study was to develop and test a method for selecting
"visually similar" regions of interest depicting breast masses from a reference
library to be used in an interactive computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) environment. 
A reference library including 1000 malignant mass regions and 2000 benign and
CAD-generated false-positive regions was established. When a suspicious mass
region is identified, the scheme segments the region and searches for similar
regions from the reference library using a multifeature based k-nearest neighbor 
(KNN) algorithm. To improve selection of reference images, we added an
interactive step. All actual masses in the reference library were subjectively
rated on a scale from 1 to 9 as to their "visual margins speculations". When an
observer identifies a suspected mass region during a case interpretation he/she
first rates the margins and the computerized search is then limited only to
regions rated as having similar levels of spiculation (within +/-1 scale
difference). In an observer preference study including 85 test regions, two sets 
of the six "similar" reference regions selected by the KNN with and without the
interactive step were displayed side by side with each test region. Four
radiologists and five nonclinician observers selected the more appropriate
("similar") reference set in a two alternative forced choice preference
experiment. All four radiologists and five nonclinician observers preferred the
sets of regions selected by the interactive method with an average frequency of
76.8% and 74.6%, respectively. The overall preference for the interactive method 
was highly significant (p < 0.001). The study demonstrated that a simple
interactive approach that includes subjectively perceived ratings of one feature 
alone namely, a rating of margin "spiculation," could substantially improve the
selection of "visually similar" reference images.

Actin binding LIM protein 3 (abLIM3).

Krupp M(1), Weinmann A, Galle PR, Teufel A.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Internal Medicine I, Johannes Gutenberg University, 55101 Mainz,
Germany.

LIM domain proteins were demonstrated to play key roles in various biological
processes such as embryonic development, cell lineage determination, and cancer
differentiation. Actin binding LIM protein 1 (abLIM1) was reported to be
localized in a genomic region often deleted in human cancers and suggested to be 
involved in axon guidance. Recently, existence of a second family member was
reported, actin binding LIM protein 2. By means of computational biology and
comparative genomics, we now characterized an additional, third member of the
actin binding LIM protein subgroup, actin binding LIM protein 3 (abLIM3). The
human mRNA sequence was previously annotated as differentially regulated in
hepatoblastoma compared to normal livers. Conservation of key structural features
of abLIM1 and abLIM2, four LIM domains and a VHD domain, suggested comparable
biological function of abLIM3 as a linker between actin cytoskeleton and cell
signaling pathways. AbLIM3 was found to be conserved in vertebrates, as
orthologous sequences were characterized for mouse, fish, and frog. In addition, 
we report the existence of abLIM2 orthologs in fish and frog, suggesting a
similar degree of evolutionary conservation. The intracellular localization of
the abLIM3 protein was predicted to be nuclear by means of Reinhardt's neural
network and the k-nearest neighbor algorithm. The corresponding abLIM3 gene was
localized to chromosome 5q32 and spanned 119 kb, organized in 24 exons. An RT-PCR
based expression profile available from the human unidentified gene-encoded
(HUGE) database demonstrated highest expression for abLIM3 in heart, lung, liver,
and brain/cerebellum accompanied by lower expression in multiple other tissues.
Furthermore, abLIM3 was expressed in fetal liver, CNS, and spinal cord.

Application of validated QSAR models of D1 dopaminergic antagonists for database 
mining.

Oloff S(1), Mailman RB, Tropsha A.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, University of North Carolina, 
Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27599, USA.

Rigorously validated quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models
have been developed for 48 antagonists of the dopamine D1 receptor and applied to
mining chemical datasets to discover novel potential antagonists. Several QSAR
methods have been employed, including comparative molecular field analysis
(CoMFA), simulated annealing-partial least squares (SA-PLS), k-nearest neighbor
(kNN), and support vector machines (SVM). With the exception of CoMFA, these
approaches employed 2D topological descriptors generated with the MolConnZ
software package (EduSoft, LLC. MolconnZ, version 4.05;
http://www.eslc.vabiotech.com/ [4.05], 2003). The original dataset was split into
training and test sets to allow for external validation of each training set
model. The resulting models were characterized by cross-validated R2 (q2) for the
training set and predictive R2 values for the test set of (q2/R2) 0.51/0.47 for
CoMFA, 0.7/0.76 for kNN, R2 for the training and test sets of 0.74/0.71 for SVM, 
and training set fitness and test set R2 values of 0.68/0.63 for SA-PLS.
Validated QSAR models with R2 > 0.7, (i.e., kNN and SVM) were used to mine three 
publicly available chemical databases: the National Cancer Institute (NCI)
database of ca. 250,000 compounds, the Maybridge Database of ca. 56,000
compounds, and the ChemDiv Database of ca. 450,000 compounds. These searches
resulted in only 54 consensus hits (i.e., predicted active by all models); five
of them were previously characterized as dopamine D1 ligands, but were not
present in the original dataset. A small fraction of the purported D1 ligands did
not contain a catechol ring found in all known dopamine full agonist ligands,
suggesting that they may be novel structural antagonist leads. This study
illustrates that the combined application of predictive QSAR modeling and
database mining may provide an important avenue for rational computer-aided drug 
discovery.

PURPOSE: This study assessed the possibility to build a prognosis predictor,
based on microarray gene expression measures, in Stage II and III colon cancer
patients.
METHODS: Tumor and nonneoplastic mucosa mRNA samples from 12 colon cancer
patients were profiled using the Affymetrix HGU133A GeneChip. Six of 12 patients 
experienced a metachronous metastasis, whereas the 6 others remained disease-free
for more than five years. Three datasets were constituted, including,
respectively, the gene expression measures in tumor samples (T), in adjacent
nonneoplastic mucosa samples (A), and the log-ratio of the gene expression
measures (L). The step-down procedure of Westfall and Young and the k-nearest
neighbor class prediction method were applied on T, A, and L. Leave-one-out
cross-validation was used to estimate the generalization error of predictors
based on different numbers of genes and neighbors.
RESULTS: The most frequent results were one false prediction with the A-based
predictors (95 percent) and two false predictions with the T- and L: -based
predictors (65 and 60 percent, respectively). A-based predictors were more stable
(i.e., less sensitive to changes of parameters, such as numbers of genes and
neighbors) than T- and L: -based predictors. Informative genes in A-based
predictors included genes involved in the oxidative and phosphorylative
mitochondrial metabolism and genes involved in cell-signaling pathways and their 
receptors.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that one can build a prognosis predictor for
Stage II and III colon cancer patients, based on microarray gene expression
measures, and suggests the potential usefulness of nonneoplastic mucosa for this 
purpose.

We have developed quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for 
44 non-nucleoside HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) of the
pyridinone derivative type. The k nearest neighbor (kNN) variable selection
approach was used. This method utilizes multiple descriptors such as molecular
connectivity indices, which are derived from two-dimensional molecular topology. 
The modeling process entailed extensive validation including the randomization of
the target property (Y-randomization) test and the division of the dataset into
multiple training and test sets to establish the external predictive power of the
training set models. QSAR models with high internal and external accuracy were
generated, with leave-one-out cross-validated R2 (q2) values ranging between 0.5 
and 0.8 for the training sets and R2 values exceeding 0.6 for the test sets. The 
best models with the highest internal and external predictive power were used to 
search the National Cancer Institute database. Derivatives of the
pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine and phenothiazine type were identified as promising
novel NNRTIs leads. Several candidates were docked into the binding pocket of
nevirapine with the AutoDock (version 3.0) software. Docking results suggested
that these types of compounds could be binding in the NNRTI binding site in a
similar mode to a known non-nucleoside inhibitor nevirapine.

Gefitinib (Iressa() is an orally active, selective EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor
that blocks signal transduction pathways. Skin toxicity has been reported to be
the major toxicity observed in patients treated with the EGFR-targeted tyrosine
kinase inhibitors, such as gefitinib and erlotinib. Although the mechanisms
underlying the development of the skin toxicity remain to be precisely clarified,
immunological mechanisms are considered to be involved. We examined the
correlations between the plasma levels of several cytokines and the risk of
development of adverse events, especially skin toxicity, induced by the
administration of gefitinib as first-line monotherapy in non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) patients. Paired plasma samples were obtained from a total 28
patients of non-small cell lung cancer; the first before the initiation of
gefitinib administration (250 mg/day) (24 patients) and the second 2 or 4 weeks
after the initiation of treatment (23 patients). The plasma concentrations of 17 
major cytokines were measured using a bead-based multiplex assay. The median
concentrations of eight of these cytokines before the start of treatment ranged
from 0.06 (IL-5) to 58.26 (MIP-1beta) (microg/ml). The concentrations of the
remaining nine cytokines were under the detectable limit (<0.01 microg/ml) in
more than 50% of the samples. Comparisons of the levels before and after
treatment showed no significant differences for any of the cytokines measured.
The MIP-1beta levels were significantly lower in the patients with skin toxicity 
(16/24) as compared with those in the patients not showing any skin toxicity
(59.1+/-10.5 versus 119.0+/-36.8; p=0.042 by the two-sample t-test). The
K-Nearest Neighbor Prediction (K=3) showed the classification rate to be 75% for 
the prediction sets containing MIP-1beta, IL-4 and IL-8. There were no
significant associations between the levels of any of the cytokines measured and 
any other parameters, including the tumor response to the drug. In conclusion,
the plasma MIP-1beta level may be a useful predictor of the development of skin
toxicity in patients receiving gefitinib treatment.

Recently, DNA microarray-based gene expression profiles have been used to
correlate the clinical behavior of cancers with the differential gene expression 
levels in cancerous and normal tissues. To this end, after selection of some
predictive genes based on signal-to-noise (S2N) ratio, unsupervised learning like
clustering and supervised learning like k-nearest neighbor (k NN) classifier are 
widely used. Instead of S2N ratio, adaptive searches like Probabilistic Model
Building Genetic Algorithm (PMBGA) can be applied for selection of a smaller size
gene subset that would classify patient samples more accurately. In this paper,
we propose a new PMBGA-based method for identification of informative genes from 
microarray data. By applying our proposed method to classification of three
microarray data sets of binary and multi-type tumors, we demonstrate that the
gene subsets selected with our technique yield better classification accuracy.

epirubicin/cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy: translation of microarray data
into clinically useful predictive signatures.

BACKGROUND: Our goal was to identify gene signatures predictive of response to
preoperative systemic chemotherapy (PST) with epirubicin/cyclophosphamide (EC) in
patients with primary breast cancer.
METHODS: Needle biopsies were obtained pre-treatment from 83 patients with breast
cancer and mRNA was profiled on Affymetrix HG-U133A arrays. Response ranged from 
pathologically confirmed complete remission (pCR), to partial remission (PR), to 
stable or progressive disease, "No Change" (NC). A primary analysis was performed
in breast tissue samples from 56 patients and 5 normal healthy individuals as a
training cohort for predictive marker identification. Gene signatures identifying
individuals most likely to respond completely to PST-EC were extracted by
combining several statistical methods and filtering criteria. In order to
optimize prediction of non responding tumors Student's t-test and Wilcoxon test
were also applied. An independent cohort of 27 patients was used to challenge the
predictive signatures. A k-Nearest neighbor algorithm as well as two independent 
linear partial least squares determinant analysis (PLS-DA) models based on the
training cohort were selected for classification of the test samples. The average
specificity of these predictions was greater than 74% for pCR, 100% for PR and
greater than 62% for NC. All three classification models could identify all pCR
cases.
RESULTS: The differential expression of 59 genes in the training and the test
cohort demonstrated capability to predict response to PST-EC treatment. Based on 
the training cohort a classifier was constructed following a decision tree.
First, a transcriptional profile capable to distinguish cancerous from normal
tissue was identified. Then, a "favorable outcome signature" (31 genes) and a
"poor outcome signature" (26 genes) were extracted from the cancer specific
signatures. This stepwise implementation could predict pCR and distinguish
between NC and PR in a subsequent set of patients. Both PLS-DA models were
implemented to discriminate all three response classes in one step.
CONCLUSION: In this study signatures were identified capable to predict clinical 
outcome in an independent set of primary breast cancer patients undergoing
PST-EC.

Molecular voting for glioma classification reflecting heterogeneity in the
continuum of cancer progression.

Gliomas, the most common brain tumors, are generally categorized into two
lineages (astrocytic and oligodendrocytic) and further classified as low-grade
(astrocytoma and oligodendroglioma), mid-grade (anaplastic astrocytoma and
anaplastic oligodendroglioma), and high-grade (glioblastoma multiforme) based on 
morphological features. A strict classification scheme has limitations because a 
specific glioma can be at any stage of the continuum of cancer progression and
may contain mixed features. Thus, a more comprehensive classification based on
molecular signatures may reflect the biological nature of specific tumors more
accurately. In this study, we used microarray technology to profile the gene
expression of 49 human brain tumors and applied the k-nearest neighbor algorithm 
for classification. We first trained the classification gene set with 19 of the
most typical glioma cases and selected a set of genes that provide the lowest
cross-validation classification error with k=5. We then applied this gene set to 
the 30 remaining cases, including several that do not belong to gliomas such as
atypical meningioma. The results showed that not only does the algorithm
correctly classify most of the gliomas, but the detailed voting results also
provide more subtle information regarding the molecular similarities to
neighboring classes. For atypical meningioma, the voting was equally split among 
the four classes, indicating a difficulty in placement of meningioma into the
four classes of gliomas. Thus, the actual voting results, which are typically
used only to decide the winning class label in k-nearest neighbor algorithms,
provide a useful method for gaining deeper insight into the stage of a tumor in
the continuum of cancer development.

Evaluation of normalization methods for cDNA microarray data by k-NN
classification.

BACKGROUND: Non-biological factors give rise to unwanted variations in cDNA
microarray data. There are many normalization methods designed to remove such
variations. However, to date there have been few published systematic evaluations
of these techniques for removing variations arising from dye biases in the
context of downstream, higher-order analytical tasks such as classification.
RESULTS: Ten location normalization methods that adjust spatial- and/or
intensity-dependent dye biases, and three scale methods that adjust scale
differences were applied, individually and in combination, to five distinct,
published, cancer biology-related cDNA microarray data sets. Leave-one-out
cross-validation (LOOCV) classification error was employed as the quantitative
end-point for assessing the effectiveness of a normalization method. In
particular, a known classifier, k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), was estimated from
data normalized using a given technique, and the LOOCV error rate of the ensuing 
model was computed. We found that k-NN classifiers are sensitive to dye biases in
the data. Using NONRM and GMEDIAN as baseline methods, our results show that
single-bias-removal techniques which remove either spatial-dependent dye bias
(referred later as spatial effect) or intensity-dependent dye bias (referred
later as intensity effect) moderately reduce LOOCV classification errors; whereas
double-bias-removal techniques which remove both spatial- and intensity effect
reduce LOOCV classification errors even further. Of the 41 different strategies
examined, three two-step processes, IGLOESS-SLFILTERW7, ISTSPLINE-SLLOESS and
IGLOESS-SLLOESS, all of which removed intensity effect globally and spatial
effect locally, appear to reduce LOOCV classification errors most consistently
and effectively across all data sets. We also found that the investigated scale
normalization methods do not reduce LOOCV classification error.
CONCLUSION: Using LOOCV error of k-NNs as the evaluation criterion, three
double-bias-removal normalization strategies, IGLOESS-SLFILTERW7,
ISTSPLINE-SLLOESS and IGLOESS-SLLOESS, outperform other strategies for removing
spatial effect, intensity effect and scale differences from cDNA microarray data.
The apparent sensitivity of k-NN LOOCV classification error to dye biases
suggests that this criterion provides an informative measure for evaluating
normalization methods. All the computational tools used in this study were
implemented using the R language for statistical computing and graphics.

One of the applications of cDNA microarrays is to recognize the class and
subclass of diseases such as cancers on the basis of statistical pattern
classification methods using gene expression data. In this paper, we apply 2000
genes expression dataset provided by Affymatrix Company: 40 samples of intestine 
cancer tissue and 22 samples of normal tissue. We compare the performance of four
pattern classification methods based on different feature selection methods.
These pattern classification methods include: Fisher linear discriminate, Logit
nonlinear discriminate, the least distance and K-nearest neighbor classifier. The
results show firstly that four pattern classifiers based on the feature selection
methods of t-test and classification tree all have better performance than those 
based on the stochastic feature selection methods, secondly that K-nearest
neighbor classifier has the best performance, thirdly that both the least
distance classifier and K-nearest neighbor classifier have better generalization,
fourthly that four classifiers are less sensitive to the composition of samples.

In silico characterization of LZTS3, a potential tumor suppressor.

Members of the leucine zipper tumor suppressor (LZTS) protein family are thought 
to play roles in cell growth modulation. The two currently known members were
identified by analyzing genomic and chromosomal alterations reported to be either
involved or deleted in various types of cancer, suggesting a causative
relationship. By means of computational biology, we have now identified a novel
member of the LZTS protein family named LZTS3. The corresponding gene was
localized to chromosome 20p13 and consisted of three exons. The novel LZTS3
protein demonstrated a high similarity to LAPSER1/LZTS2 and FEZ1/LZTS1, two
members of the LZTS family. The conserved FEZ1 domain contains a leucine zipper
motif similar to the cAMP-responsive activating transcription factor 5. As FEZ1
inhibits cancer cell growth through the regulation of mitosis and its alteration 
resulted in abnormal cell growth, the LZTS3 protein was expected to have similar 
functions during cancer differentiation. Furthermore, the protein was conserved
in vertebrates, as orthologs could be identified in mouse, rat, and zebrafish.
The intracellular localization of the LZTS3 protein was predicted to be nuclear
by means of Reinhardt's neural network and the k-nearest neighbor algorithm. An
RT-PCR-based expression profile available from the human unidentified
gene-encoded (HUGE) database demonstrated the highest expression in the brain and
kidney, accompanied by lower expression in multiple other tissues.

OBJECTIVE: In this work, methods utilizing supervised and unsupervised machine
learning are applied to analyze radiologically derived morphological and
calculated kinetic tumour features. The features are extracted from dynamic
contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) time-course data.
MATERIAL: The DCE-MRI data of the female breast are obtained within the UK
Multicenter Breast Screening Study. The group of patients imaged in this study is
selected on the basis of an increased genetic risk for developing breast cancer.
METHODS: The k-means clustering and self-organizing maps (SOM) are applied to
analyze the signal structure in terms of visualization. We employ k-nearest
neighbor classifiers (k-nn), support vector machines (SVM) and decision trees
(DT) to classify features using a computer aided diagnosis (CAD) approach.
RESULTS: Regarding the unsupervised techniques, clustering according to features 
indicating benign and malignant characteristics is observed to a limited extend. 
The supervised approaches classified the data with 74% accuracy (DT) and
providing an area under the receiver-operator-characteristics (ROC) curve (AUC)
of 0.88 (SVM).
CONCLUSION: It was found that contour and wash-out type (WOT) features determined
by the radiologists lead to the best SVM classification results. Although a fast 
signal uptake in early time-point measurements is an important feature for
malignant/benign classification of tumours, our results indicate that the
wash-out characteristics might be considered as important.

Accurate preoperative prediction of lymph node metastasis and degree of tumor
invasion would facilitate an appropriate decision of the extent of surgical
resection of cancers to reduce unnecessary complication or to minimize the risk
of recurrence in patients. We analyzed gene expression profiles characteristic of
the invasiveness of colorectal carcinoma in a total of 89 cases, using a cDNA
array and pattern classification algorithms. We set binary classes for a panel of
clinicopathologic parameters, each of which was divided at different levels for
categories (discrete) or values (continuous). We searched an optimal combination 
of genes to discriminate the classes by using of a feature subset selection
algorithm, which was applied to a set of genes preselected on the basis of
statistical difference in expression (two-sided t test, P < or = 0.05). We used a
sequential forward feature selection which additively searched a combination of
genes, giving a minimal leave-one-out classification error rate of a k-nearest
neighbor classifier. In the process of gene preselection, we found a remarkable
difference in the expression pattern of genes according to the anatomical
location of cancers. The difference was most prominent when the classes were set 
for cecum, ascending colon, transverse colon, and descending colon (CATD) versus 
sigmoid colon and rectum (SR). By stratifying these two locations, we were able
to extract gene expression profiles characteristic of the classes of the presence
versus absence of lymph node metastasis, lymphatic invasion, vascular invasion
and degree of mural invasion, and pathological stages, with an accuracy of more
than 90%. These results suggest that colorectal cancers harbor distinct molecular
pathophysiological statuses according to their right-to-left locations, of which 
stratification is important for pattern classification of cDNA array data.

In the search for new cancer subtypes by gene expression profiling, it is
essential to avoid misclassifying samples of unknown subtypes as known ones. In
this paper, we evaluated the false positive error rates of several classification
algorithms through a 'null test' by presenting classifiers a large collection of 
independent samples that do not belong to any of the tumor types in the training 
dataset. The benchmark dataset is available at
www2.genome.rcast.u-tokyo.ac.jp/pm/. We found that k-nearest neighbor (KNN) and
support vector machine (SVM) have very high false positive error rates when fewer
genes (<100) are used in prediction. The error rate can be partially reduced by
including more genes. On the other hand, prototype matching (PM) method has a
much lower false positive error rate. Such robustness can be achieved without
loss of sensitivity by introducing suitable measures of prediction confidence. We
also proposed a cluster-and-select technique to select genes for classification. 
The nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis H test is employed to select genes
differentially expressed in multiple tumor types. To reduce the redundancy, we
then divided these genes into clusters with similar expression patterns and
selected a given number of genes from each cluster. The reliability of the new
algorithm is tested on three public datasets.

GenSo-FDSS: a neural-fuzzy decision support system for pediatric ALL cancer
subtype identification using gene expression data.

OBJECTIVE: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common malignancy of
childhood, representing nearly one third of all pediatric cancers. Currently, the
treatment of pediatric ALL is centered on tailoring the intensity of the therapy 
applied to a patient's risk of relapse, which is linked to the type of leukemia
the patient has. Hence, accurate and correct diagnosis of the various leukemia
subtypes becomes an important first step in the treatment process. Recently, gene
expression profiling using DNA microarrays has been shown to be a viable and
accurate diagnostic tool to identify the known prognostically important ALL
subtypes. Thus, there is currently a huge interest in developing autonomous
classification systems for cancer diagnosis using gene expression data. This is
to achieve an unbiased analysis of the data and also partly to handle the large
amount of genetic information extracted from the DNA microarrays.
METHODOLOGY: Generally, existing medical decision support systems (DSS) for
cancer classification and diagnosis are based on traditional statistical methods 
such as Bayesian decision theory and machine learning models such as neural
networks (NN) and support vector machine (SVM). Though high accuracies have been 
reported for these systems, they fall short on certain critical areas. These
included (a) being able to present the extracted knowledge and explain the
computed solutions to the users; (b) having a logical deduction process that is
similar and intuitive to the human reasoning process; and (c) flexible enough to 
incorporate new knowledge without running the risk of eroding old but valid
information. On the other hand, a neural fuzzy system, which is synthesized to
emulate the human ability to learn and reason in the presence of imprecise and
incomplete information, has the ability to overcome the above-mentioned
shortcomings. However, existing neural fuzzy systems have their own limitations
when used in the design and implementation of DSS. Hence, this paper proposed the
use of a novel neural fuzzy system: the generic self-organising fuzzy neural
network (GenSoFNN) with truth-value restriction (TVR) fuzzy inference, as a fuzzy
DSS (denoted as GenSo-FDSS) for the classification of ALL subtypes using gene
expression data.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The performance of the GenSo-FDSS system is encouraging
when benchmarked against those of NN, SVM and the K-nearest neighbor (K-NN)
classifier. On average, a classification rate of above 90% has been achieved
using the GenSo-FDSS system.

OBJECTIVE: To better understand the nature of the malignancy of biliary tract
carcinoma and evaluate the feasibility of its prediction by gene expression
profiles.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We explored the gene expression profiles characteristic of
progression and invasiveness in the cDNA array data obtained from 37 biliary
tract carcinomas (15 bile duct, 11 gallbladder, 11 of ampulla of Vater). We
pre-selected 51 and 100 genes for the presence versus absence of lymph node
metastasis and perineural invasion on the basis of statistical difference. To
search optimized sets of genes for prediction, we applied a sequential forward
feature selection, minimizing leave-one-out error rates on a k-nearest neighbor
classifier. We could predict lymph node metastasis and perineural invasion with
an accuracy of 94 and 100%, respectively. When the 6-stage IA cancers without
perineural invasion were precluded, a marked difference in gene expression (147
gene), discriminable with 100% accuracy, was noted between positive versus
negative perineural invasion, suggesting that the acquisition of invasive
character is rather a later molecular pathological event in biliary tract cancer.
CONCLUSION: The present method provides a powerful means of classifying biliary
tract carcinomas. We also suggest that perineural invasion is an important target
of array databased pattern classification, which may predict patient outcomes and
facilitate the determination of the extent of surgery to minimize the risk of
recurrence.

Therapeutics, Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.

OBJECTIVE: Non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is one of the leading causes of 
death in the world. Lymph node metastasis is not only an important factor in
estimating the extent and the metastatic potential of an NSCLC but also in
prognosticating the patient outcome. Preoperative prediction of lymph node
metastasis might greatly facilitate the choice of appropriate surgical and
medical options in patients with NSCLC.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Using a cDNA array, we analyzed the expression profiles of
1,289 genes in 92 cancer tissues of NSCLC (37 squamous cell carcinomas and 55
adenocarcinomas). We divided the patients into two groups (classes) for each of
various pathological factors, such as lymph node metastasis and pT-stage. For
each pair of classes, we searched for an optimal combination of genes to classify
the cases using a sequential forward selection algorithm starting from a gene set
that showed significant difference in expression between the classes. We used the
leave-one-out error cross-validation on a k-nearest neighbor classifier to
sequentially choose the gene. Using the optimized set of genes, it was possible
to stratify the patients for lymph node metastasis (pN-stage) and pT-stage at,
respectively, 100% (23 genes) and 100% (55 genes) for cases with squamous cell
carcinomas and 94% (43 genes) and 92% (35 genes) for those with adenocarcinomas.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that expression profiling using feature selection
provides a powerful means of stratification (personalization) of NSCLC patients

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: No widespread clinical method provides specific
information about the angiogenic characteristics of gliomas. We characterized
blood volume and vascular morphologic parameters from combined gradient-echo (GE)
and spin-echo (SE) MR imaging and assessed their relationship to tumor grade, a
known correlate of glioma angiogenesis.
METHODS: Simultaneous GE and SE echo-planar imaging was performed with bolus
gadolinium administration (0.20-0.25 mmol/kg) in 73 patients with glioma. To
diminish possible T1 changes due to contrast agent extravasation, a preload
(0.05-0.10 mmol/kg) was administered before the study, and a postprocessing
correction algorithm was applied. Image maps of total (GE) and microvascular (SE)
relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) and the mean vessel diameter (mVD)
calculated from the ratio of GE and SE relaxation rate changes (DeltaR2*/DeltaR2)
were compared with tumor grade. A nonparametric K nearest-neighbor decision rule 
was applied to determine if the combined data could be used to distinguish
low-grade (I-II) from high-grade (III-IV) tumors on a per-patient basis.
RESULTS: For whole tumors, significant correlations were found between GE rCBV
and grade (P < .0001) and between mVD and grade (P = .0001) but not between SE
rCBV and grade (P = .08). For areas of highest SE rCBV (microvascular hotspots), 
SE rCBV and tumor grade were significantly correlated (P = .0007). In terms of
differentiation, 69% of low-grade tumors and 96% of high-grade tumors were
correctly classified.
CONCLUSION: Combined GE and SE MR imaging provides information consistent with
neoplastic angiogenesis, demonstrating its potential to aid in optimizing
treatments, categorizing lesions, and influencing patient care.

A probabilistic active support vector learning algorithm.

India. pabitra_r@isical.ac.in

The paper describes a probabilistic active learning strategy for support vector
machine (SVM) design in large data applications. The learning strategy is
motivated by the statistical query model. While most existing methods of active
SVM learning query for points based on their proximity to the current separating 
hyperplane, the proposed method queries for a set of points according to a
distribution as determined by the current separating hyperplane and a newly
defined concept of an adaptive confidence factor. This enables the algorithm to
have more robust and efficient learning capabilities. The confidence factor is
estimated from local information using the k nearest neighbor principle. The
effectiveness of the method is demonstrated on real-life data sets both in terms 
of generalization performance, query complexity, and training time.

Application of predictive QSAR models to database mining: identification and
experimental validation of novel anticonvulsant compounds.

We have developed a drug discovery strategy that employs variable selection
quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for chemical database 
mining. The approach starts with the development of rigorously validated QSAR
models obtained with the variable selection k nearest neighbor (kNN) method (or, 
in principle, with any other robust model-building technique). Model validation
is based on several statistical criteria, including the randomization of the
target property (Y-randomization), independent assessment of the training set
model's predictive power using external test sets, and the establishment of the
model's applicability domain. All successful models are employed in database
mining concurrently; in each case, only variables selected as a result of model
building (termed descriptor pharmacophore) are used in chemical similarity
searches comparing active compounds of the training set (queries) with those in
chemical databases. Specific biological activity (characteristic of the training 
set compounds) of external database entries found to be within a predefined
similarity threshold of the training set molecules is predicted on the basis of
the validated QSAR models using the applicability domain criteria. Compounds
judged to have high predicted activities by all or the majority of all models are
considered as consensus hits. We report on the application of this computational 
strategy for the first time for the discovery of anticonvulsant agents in the
Maybridge and National Cancer Institute (NCI) databases containing ca. 250,000
compounds combined. Forty-eight anticonvulsant agents of the functionalized amino
acid (FAA) series were used to build kNN variable selection QSAR models. The 10
best models were applied to mining chemical databases, and 22 compounds were
selected as consensus hits. Nine compounds were synthesized and tested at the NIH
Epilepsy Branch, Rockville, MD using the same biological test that was employed
to assess the anticonvulsant activity of the training set compounds; of these
nine, four were exact database hits and five were derived from the hits by minor 
chemical modifications. Seven of these nine compounds were confirmed to be
active, indicating an exceptionally high hit rate. The approach described in this
report can be used as a general rational drug discovery tool.

BACKGROUND: Differential diagnosis of melanoma from melanocytic nevi is often not
straightforward. Thus, a growing interest has developed in the last decade in the
automated analysis of digitized images obtained by epiluminescence microscopy
techniques to assist clinicians in differentiating early melanoma from benign
skin lesions.
PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate diagnostic accuracy provided by
different statistical classifiers on a large set of pigmented skin lesions
grabbed by four digital analyzers located in two different dermatological units.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Images of 391 melanomas and 449 melanocytic nevi were
included in the study. A linear classifier was built by using the method of
receiver operating characteristic curves to identify a threshold value for a
fixed sensitivity of 95%. A K-nearest-neighbor classifier, a nonparametric method
of pattern recognition, was constructed using all available image features and
trained for a sensitivity of 98% on a large exemplar set of lesions.
RESULTS: On independent test sets of lesions, the linear classifier and the
K-nearest-neighbor classifier produced a mean sensitivity of 95% and 98% and a
mean specificity of 78% and of 79%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our study suggests that computer-aided
differentiation of melanoma from benign pigmented lesions obtained with DB-Mips
is feasible and, above all, reliable. In fact, the same instrumentations used in 
different units provided similar diagnostic accuracy. Whether this would improve 
early diagnosis of melanoma and/or reducing unnecessary surgery needs to be
demonstrated by a randomized clinical trial.

This article presents a pattern-recognition approach to the soft tissue tumors
(STT) benign/malignant character diagnosis using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging 
applied to a large multicenter database.OBJECTIVE: To develop and test an
automatic classifier of STT into benign or malignant by using classical MR
imaging findings and epidemiological information.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A database of 430 patients (62% benign and 38% malignant) 
from several European multicenter registers. There were 61 different histologies 
(36 with benign and 25 with malignant nature). Three pattern-recognition methods 
(artificial neural networks, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor) were
applied to learn the discrimination between benignity and malignancy based on a
defined MR imaging findings protocol. After the systems had learned by using
training samples (with 302 cases), the clinical decision support system was
tested in the diagnosis of 128 new STT cases.
RESULTS: An 88-92% efficacy was obtained in a not-viewed set of tumors using the 
pattern-recognition techniques. The best results were obtained with a
back-propagation artificial neural network.
CONCLUSION: Benign vs. malignant STT discrimination is accurate by using
pattern-recognition methods based on classical MR image findings. This objective 
tool will assist radiologists in STT grading.

Reliable classification of two-class cancer data using evolutionary algorithms.

Kanpur, Kanpur 208 016, India. deb@iitk.ac.in

In the area of bioinformatics, the identification of gene subsets responsible for
classifying available disease samples to two or more of its variants is an
important task. Such problems have been solved in the past by means of
unsupervised learning methods (hierarchical clustering, self-organizing maps,
k-mean clustering, etc.) and supervised learning methods (weighted voting
approach, k-nearest neighbor method, support vector machine method, etc.). Such
problems can also be posed as optimization problems of minimizing gene subset
size to achieve reliable and accurate classification. The main difficulties in
solving the resulting optimization problem are the availability of only a few
samples compared to the number of genes in the samples and the exorbitantly large
search space of solutions. Although there exist a few applications of
evolutionary algorithms (EAs) for this task, here we treat the problem as a
multiobjective optimization problem of minimizing the gene subset size and
minimizing the number of misclassified samples. Moreover, for a more reliable
classification, we consider multiple training sets in evaluating a classifier.
Contrary to the past studies, the use of a multiobjective EA (NSGA-II) has
enabled us to discover a smaller gene subset size (such as four or five) to
correctly classify 100% or near 100% samples for three cancer samples (Leukemia, 
Lymphoma, and Colon). We have also extended the NSGA-II to obtain multiple
non-dominated solutions discovering as much as 352 different three-gene
combinations providing a 100% correct classification to the Leukemia data. In
order to have further confidence in the identification task, we have also
introduced a prediction strength threshold for determining a sample's belonging
to one class or the other. All simulation results show consistent gene subset
identifications on three disease samples and exhibit the flexibilities and
efficacies in using a multiobjective EA for the gene subset identification task.

Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.

MOTIVATION: Novel methods, both molecular and statistical, are urgently needed to
take advantage of recent advances in biotechnology and the human genome project
for disease diagnosis and prognosis. Mass spectrometry (MS) holds great promise
for biomarker identification and genome-wide protein profiling. It has been
demonstrated in the literature that biomarkers can be identified to distinguish
normal individuals from cancer patients using MS data. Such progress is
especially exciting for the detection of early-stage ovarian cancer patients.
Although various statistical methods have been utilized to identify biomarkers
from MS data, there has been no systematic comparison among these approaches in
their relative ability to analyze MS data.
RESULTS: We compare the performance of several classes of statistical methods for
the classification of cancer based on MS spectra. These methods include: linear
discriminant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis, k-nearest neighbor
classifier, bagging and boosting classification trees, support vector machine,
and random forest (RF). The methods are applied to ovarian cancer and control
serum samples from the National Ovarian Cancer Early Detection Program clinic at 
Northwestern University Hospital. We found that RF outperforms other methods in
the analysis of MS data.

Hepatoblastoma is a common hepatic tumor in children. Although evidence regarding
cytogenetic and molecular genetic alterations in hepatoblastomas has been
reported, the molecular events affecting the biologic characteristics of this
tumor, including alterations of the gene expression profile, are largely unknown.
To identify genes differentially expressed between nondiseased liver (NDL) and
hepatoblastoma tumor (HBT), we analyzed the gene expression profile in 14 NDL and
16 HBT samples using a high-density oligonucleotide DNA array. Using Mann-Whitney
U test followed by the k-nearest neighbor algorithm, we identified 26 genes
(predictor genes) that were able to assign unknown samples derived from NDL and
HBT to either the NDL group or HBT group with 100% accuracy. Using a
cross-validation approach, we confirmed that the k-nearest neighbor algorithm
assigned the particular samples derived from NDL and HBT to either the NDL or HBT
group with 93.3% (28/30 samples) accuracy. In the 26 predictor genes, we found
alteration of the expression of genes regulating cell division (NAP1L1, STMN1,
CCNG2, and CDC7L1) and tumor cell growth (IGF2 and IGFBP4) in HBT. Four predictor
genes (ETV3, TPR, CD34, and NR1I3) were also found to be mapped to the
chromosomal region 1q21 approximately q32, which has been reported to be
frequently involved in the development of hepatoblastoma. The findings obtained
in this study suggest that alteration of the expression of some genes regulating 
cell division and tumor cell growth may be characteristics of the gene expression
profile in HBT, and that alteration of the expression of the four predictor genes
mapped to chromosomal region 1q21 approximately q32 may also contribute to the
differences in gene expression profile between NDL and HBT.

Accurate and reliable decision making in oncological prognosis can help in the
planning of suitable surgery and therapy, and generally, improve patient
management through the different stages of the disease. In recent years, several 
prognostic markers have been used as indicators of disease progression in
oncology. However, the rapid increase in the discovery of novel prognostic
markers resulting from the development in medical technology, has dictated the
need for developing reliable methods for extracting clinically significant
markers where complex and nonlinear interactions between these markers naturally 
exist. The aim of this paper is to investigate the fuzzy k-nearest neighbor
(FK-NN) classifier as a fuzzy logic method that provides a certainty degree for
prognostic decision and assessment of the markers, and to compare it with: 1)
logistic regression as a statistical method and 2) multilayer feedforward
backpropagation neural networks an artificial neural-network tool, the latter two
techniques having been widely used for oncological prognosis. In order to achieve
this aim, breast and prostate cancer data sets are considered as benchmarks for
this analysis. The overall results obtained indicate that the FK-NN-based method 
yields the highest predictive accuracy, and that it has produced a more reliable 
prognostic marker model than the statistical and artificial neural-network-based 
methods.

Multiwavelet grading of pathological images of prostate.

Jafari-Khouzani K(1), Soltanian-Zadeh H.

Histological grading of pathological images is used to determine level of
malignancy of cancerous tissues. This is a very important task in prostate cancer
prognosis, since it is used for treatment planning. If infection of cancer is not
rejected by non-invasive diagnostic techniques like magnetic resonance imaging,
computed tomography scan, and ultrasound, then biopsy specimens of tissue are
tested. For prostate, biopsied tissue is stained by hematoxyline and eosine
method and viewed by pathologists under a microscope to determine its
histological grade. Human grading is very subjective due to interobserver and
intraobserver variations and in some cases difficult and time-consuming. Thus, an
automatic and repeatable technique is needed for grading. Gleason grading system 
is the most common method for histological grading of prostate tissue samples.
According to this system, each cancerous specimen is assigned one of five grades.
Although some automatic systems have been developed for analysis of pathological 
images, Gleason grading has not yet been automated; the goal of this research is 
to automate it. To this end, we calculate energy and entropy features of
multiwavelet coefficients of the image. Then, we select most discriminative
features by simulated annealing and use a k-nearest neighbor classifier to
classify each image to appropriate grade (class). The leaving-one-out technique
is used for error rate estimation. We also obtain the results using features
extracted by wavelet packets and co-occurrence matrices and compare them with the
multiwavelet method. Experimental results show the superiority of the
multiwavelet transforms compared with other techniques. For multiwavelets,
critically sampled preprocessing outperforms repeated-row preprocessing and has
less sensitivity to noise for second level of decomposition. The first level of
decomposition is very sensitive to noise and, thus, should not be used for
feature extraction. The best multiwavelet method grades prostate pathological
images correctly 97% of the time.

In modern clinical neuro-oncology, histopathological diagnosis affects
therapeutic decisions and prognostic estimation more than any other variable.
Among high-grade gliomas, histologically classic glioblastomas and anaplastic
oligodendrogliomas follow markedly different clinical courses. Unfortunately,
many malignant gliomas are diagnostically challenging; these nonclassic lesions
are difficult to classify by histological features, generating considerable
interobserver variability and limited diagnostic reproducibility. The resulting
tentative pathological diagnoses create significant clinical confusion. We
investigated whether gene expression profiling, coupled with class prediction
methodology, could be used to classify high-grade gliomas in a manner more
objective, explicit, and consistent than standard pathology. Microarray analysis 
was used to determine the expression of approximately 12000 genes in a set of 50 
gliomas, 28 glioblastomas and 22 anaplastic oligodendrogliomas. Supervised
learning approaches were used to build a two-class prediction model based on a
subset of 14 glioblastomas and 7 anaplastic oligodendrogliomas with classic
histology. A 20-feature k-nearest neighbor model correctly classified 18 of the
21 classic cases in leave-one-out cross-validation when compared with
pathological diagnoses. This model was then used to predict the classification of
clinically common, histologically nonclassic samples. When tumors were classified
according to pathology, the survival of patients with nonclassic glioblastoma and
nonclassic anaplastic oligodendroglioma was not significantly different (P =
0.19). However, class distinctions according to the model were significantly
associated with survival outcome (P = 0.05). This class prediction model was
capable of classifying high-grade, nonclassic glial tumors objectively and
reproducibly. Moreover, the model provided a more accurate predictor of prognosis
in these nonclassic lesions than did pathological classification. These data
suggest that class prediction models, based on defined molecular profiles,
classify diagnostically challenging malignant gliomas in a manner that better
correlates with clinical outcome than does standard pathology.

Tumor hypoxia and blood vessel detection: an image analysis technique for
simultaneous tumor hypoxia grading and blood vessel detection in tissue sections.

Loukas CG(1), Wilson GD, Vojnovic B, Linney A.

Author information: 
(1)Gray Cancer Institute, Mount Vernon Hospital, Northwood, Middlesex, United
Kingdom. c.loukas@ion.ucl.ac.uk

We have developed a multistage image analysis technique for the simultaneous
segmentation of blood vessels and hypoxic regions in dual-stained tumor tissue
sections. The algorithm, which is integrated in a task-oriented image analysis
system developed on-site, initially uses the K-nearest neighbor classification
rule in order to label the image pixels. Classification is based on a training
set selected from manually drawn regions corresponding to the areas of interest. 
If the output image contains a significant number of misclassified pixels, the
user has the option to apply a series of specific problem-designed routines
(texture analysis, fuzzy c-means clustering, and edge detection) in order to
improve the final segmentation result. Validation experiments indicate that the
algorithm can robustly detect these biological features, even in tissue sections 
with a very low quality of staining. This approach has also been combined with
other image analysis based procedures in order to objectively obtain quantitative
measurements of potential clinical interest.

Bremen, Germany.

In-vitro NMR spectroscopic examinations of tissue extracts can be combined with
appropriate pattern-recognition and visualization techniques in order to monitor 
characteristic metabolic differences between tissue classes. In the present
study, such techniques are applied to a set of 88 breast-tissue samples with the 
intention of identifying typical differences between various tissue classes. The 
set contains 49 breast-tumor samples of various tumor grades and 39 samples of
healthy tissue. The metabolite compositions of the tissue extracts were
investigated using a dual extraction technique and high-resolution (1)H-NMR
spectroscopy. The spectra of the hydrophilic and the lipophilic compounds were
assigned to three groups according to different malignancy grades of the
respective tissue samples. The group characteristics were analyzed using the
k-nearest-neighbor method and self-organizing-map visualizations. The results
show an increase of UDP-hexose, phosphocholine and phosphoethanolamine
concentrations according to the tumor grade. Higher concentrations of taurine
were detected in the malignant samples. Myo-inositol and glucose content were
elevated in control samples compared with malignant tissue. Both compounds also
characterized different subgroups in the pool of unaffected tissue samples
depending upon fat content or fibrosis. Several lipid metabolites showed a
characteristic elevation with high malignancy.

Deriving quantitative conclusions from microarray expression data.

Olshen AB(1), Jain AN.

Author information: 
(1)Comprehensive Cancer Center, Cancer Research Institute, and Department of
Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94143-0128, USA.

MOTIVATION: The last few years have seen the development of DNA microarray
technology that allows simultaneous measurement of the expression levels of
thousands of genes. While many methods have been developed to analyze such data, 
most have been visualization-based. Methods that yield quantitative conclusions
have been diverse and complex.
RESULTS: We present two straightforward methods for identifying specific genes
whose expression is linked with a phenotype or outcome variable as well as for
systematically predicting sample class membership: (1) a conservative,
permutation-based approach to identifying differentially expressed genes; (2) an 
augmentation of K-nearest-neighbor pattern classification. Our analyses replicate
the quantitative conclusions of Golub et al. (1999; Science, 286, 531-537) on
leukemia data, with better classification results, using far simpler methods.
With the breast tumor data of Perou et al. (2000; Nature, 406, 747-752), the
methods lend rigorous quantitative support to the conclusions of the original
paper. In the case of the lymphoma data in Alizadeh et al. (2000; Nature, 403,
503-511), our analyses only partially support the conclusions of the original
authors.

Genomic copy number analysis of non-small cell lung cancer using array
comparative genomic hybridization: implications of the phosphatidylinositol

Genomic abnormalities at 348 loci encoding genes that may contribute to lung
cancer transformation and progression were assessed using array comparative
genomic hybridization in 21 squamous carcinomas (SqCas) and 16 adenocarcinomas
(AdCas). Hierarchical clustering showed a clear pattern of gains and losses for
the SqCas, whereas the pattern for AdCas was less distinct. Cross-validated
classification using a K-nearest-neighbor assigned, on average, 32 of 37 samples 
to their proper histological subtype. The most noticeable differences between
SqCas and AdCas were gain of chromosome 3q22-q26 and loss of chromosome 3p. These
occurred almost exclusively in SqCas. The region of recurrent increase is
approximately 30 Mb in extent, ranging from EVI1 to TFRC. PIK3CA, the alpha
catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), is in this region. The
PIK3CA copy number increase was validated using fluorescence in situ
hybridization to lung cancer tissue microarrays. Activity of the downstream PI3K 
effector protein kinase B (PKB) was higher in SqCas than in AdCas and was
correlated with PIK3CA copy number (r = 0.75), suggesting that these copy number 
increases contribute to activation of PI3K signaling in SqCas of the lung.

MOTIVATION: We recently introduced a multivariate approach that selects a subset 
of predictive genes jointly for sample classification based on expression data.
We tested the algorithm on colon and leukemia data sets. As an extension to our
earlier work, we systematically examine the sensitivity, reproducibility and
stability of gene selection/sample classification to the choice of parameters of 
the algorithm.
METHODS: Our approach combines a Genetic Algorithm (GA) and the k-Nearest
Neighbor (KNN) method to identify genes that can jointly discriminate between
different classes of samples (e.g. normal versus tumor). The GA/KNN method is a
stochastic supervised pattern recognition method. The genes identified are
subsequently used to classify independent test set samples.
RESULTS: The GA/KNN method is capable of selecting a subset of predictive genes
from a large noisy data set for sample classification. It is a multivariate
approach that can capture the correlated structure in the data. We find that for 
a given data set gene selection is highly repeatable in independent runs using
the GA/KNN method. In general, however, gene selection may be less robust than
classification.

Center, Im Neuenheimer Feld 280, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The radiologic assessment of suspicious brain lesions
after stereotactic radiotherapy of brain tumors is difficult. The purpose of our 
study was to define parameters from single-voxel proton MR spectroscopy that
provide a probability measure for differentiating neoplastic from
radiation-induced, nonneoplastic lesions.
METHODS: Seventy-two lesions in 56 patients were examined using a combined MR
imaging and MR spectroscopy protocol (point-resolved spectroscopy, TE = 135 ms). 
Signal intensities of cholines, creatines, N-acetyl aspartate, and the presence
of lactate and lipid resonances were correlated to final diagnoses established by
clinical and MR imaging follow-up, positron emission tomography studies, or
biopsy/surgery. Statistical analysis was performed using the t test, linear
discriminant analysis, and k nearest-neighbor method.
RESULTS: Significantly increased signal intensity ratios I(tCho)/I(tCr) (P
<.0001) and I(tCho)/I(NAA) (P <.0001) were observed in neoplastic (n = 34)
compared with nonneoplastic lesions (n = 32) and contralateral normal brain (n = 
33). Analysis of I(tCho)/I(tCr) and I(tCho)/I(NAA) data yielded correct
retrospective classification as neoplastic and nonneoplastic in 82% and 81% of
the lesions, respectively. Neither I(NAA)/I(tCr) nor signal intensitities of
lactate or lipids were useful for differential diagnosis.
CONCLUSION: Metabolic information provided by proton MR spectroscopy is useful
for the differentiation of neoplastic and nonneoplastic brain lesions after
stereotactic radiotherapy of brain tumors.

Automated classification of clustered microcalcifications into malignant and
benign types.

Veldkamp WJ(1), Karssemeijer N, Otten JD, Hendriks JH.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Radiology, University Medical Centre St Radboud, Nijmegen, The
Netherlands.

The objectives in this study were to design and test a fully automated method for
classification of microcalcification clusters into malignant and benign types,
and to compare the method's performance with that of radiologists. A novel aspect
of the approach is that the relative location and orientation of clusters inside 
the breast was taken into account for feature calculation. Furthermore,
correspondence of location of clusters in mediolateral oblique (MLO) and
cranio-caudal (CC) views, was used in feature calculation and in final
classification. Initially, microcalcifications were automatically detected by
using a statistical method based on Bayesian techniques and a Markov random field
model. To determine malignancy or benignancy of a cluster, a method based on two 
classification steps was developed. In the first step, classification of clusters
was performed and in the second step a patient based classification was done. A
total of 16 features was used in the study. To identify meaningful features, a
feature selection was applied, using the area under the receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curve (Az value) as a criterion. For classification the
k-nearest-neighbor method was used in a leave-one-patient-out procedure. A
database of 192 mammograms with 280 true positive detected microcalcification
clusters was used for evaluation of the method. The set consisted of cases that
were selected for diagnostic work up during a 4 year period of screening in the
Nijmegen region (The Netherlands). Because of the high positive predictive value 
in the screening program (50%), this set did not contain obvious benign cases.
The method's best patient-based performance on this set corresponded with Az =
0.83, using nine features. A subset of the data set, containing mammograms from
90 patients, was used for comparing the computer results to radiologists'
performance. Ten radiologists read these cases on a light-box and assessed the
probability of malignancy for each patient. All participants had experience in
clinical mammography and participated in our observer study during the last 2
days of a 2-week training session leading to screening mammography certification.
Results on the subset showed that the method's performance (Az = 0.83) was
considerably higher than that of the radiologists (Az = 0.63).

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance of karyometry and histometry in the
prediction of survival, recurrence and response of early-stage invasive cervical 
carcinoma.
STUDY DESIGN: Nuclear morphometry, chromatin texture and tissue architecture
(characterized by syntactic structure analysis) were measured using a
semiautomated image analysis system on 46 cases of Feulgen-stained tissue
sections. The performance of the features was compared to that of clinical
features, reported to be the best prognosticators until now, such as age,
lympho-vascular permeation, histologic type, stage and grade. A K nearest
neighbor classifier was used for classification.
RESULTS: In the prediction of three-year survival, recurrence and response,
syntactic structure analysis proved to be the best performer. Classification
rates were, respectively, 100%, 94.4% and 94.5%. In all classifications,
karyometric and histometric features outperformed clinical features. In general, 
the best performing features described differences in second-order population
statistics (standard deviations).
CONCLUSION: The results show that a quantitative analysis based on nuclear
morphology, chromatin texture and histology can be considered an excellent aid in
the prognosis of invasive cervical carcinoma. The measurements are not hampered
by the need to undertake complete resections and are suited to daily practice
when implemented in a semiautomated image analysis system.

Model selection for a medical diagnostic decision support system: a breast cancer
detection case.

West D(1), West V.

Carolina University, Greenville, NC 27836, USA. westv@mail.brody.ecu.edu

There are a number of different quantitative models that can be used in a medical
diagnostic decision support system (MDSS) including parametric methods (linear
discriminant analysis or logistic regression), non-parametric models (K nearest
neighbor, or kernel density) and several neural network models. The complexity of
the diagnostic task is thought to be one of the prime determinants of model
selection. Unfortunately, there is no theory available to guide model selection. 
Practitioners are left to either choose a favorite model or to test a small
subset using cross validation methods. This paper illustrates the use of a
self-organizing map (SOM) to guide model selection for a breast cancer MDSS. The 
topological ordering properties of the SOM are used to define targets for an
ideal accuracy level similar to a Bayes optimal level. These targets can then be 
used in model selection, variable reduction, parameter determination, and to
assess the adequacy of the clinical measurement system. These ideas are applied
to a successful model selection for a real-world breast cancer database.
Diagnostic accuracy results are reported for individual models, for ensembles of 
neural networks, and for stacked predictors.

BACKGROUND: Malignant mesothelioma, a mesoderm-derived tumor, is related to
asbestos exposure and remains a diagnostic challenge because none of the genetic 
or immunohistochemical markers have yet been proven to be specific. To assist in 
the identification of mesothelioma and to differentiate it from other common
lesions at the same location, we have tested the performance of syntactic
structure analysis (SSA) in an automated classification procedure.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Light-microscopic images of tissue sections of malignant
mesothelioma, hyperplastic mesothelium, and adenocarcinoma were analyzed using
parameters selected from the Voronoi diagram, Gabriel's graph, and the minimum
spanning tree which were classified with a K-nearest-neighbor algorithm.
RESULTS: Results showed that mesotheliomas were diagnosed correctly in 74% of the
cases; 76% of the adenocarcinomas were correctly graded, and 88% of the
mesotheliomas were correctly typed. The performance of the parameters was
dependent on the obtained classification (i.e., tumor-tumor versus tumor-benign).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that SSA is valuable in the differential
classification of mesothelioma and that it supplements a visually appraised
diagnosis. The recognition scores may be increased by a combination of SSA with, 
for example, cellular or nuclear parameters, measured at higher magnifications to
form a solid base for fully automated expert systems.

Fast tissue segmentation based on a 4D feature map in characterization of
intracranial lesions.

Vinitski S(1), Gonzalez CF, Knobler R, Andrews D, Iwanaga T, Curtis M.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Radiology, Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania 19107, USA.

The aim of this work was to develop a fast and accurate method for tissue
segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based on a four-dimensional (4D)
feature map and compare it with that derived from a 3D feature map.
High-resolution MRI was performed in 5 normal individuals, in 12 patients with
brain multiple sclerosis (MS), and 9 patients with malignant brain tumors. Three 
inputs (proton-density, T2-weighted fast spin-echo, and T1-weighted spin-echo MR 
images) were routinely utilized. As a fourth input, either magnetization transfer
MRT was used or T1-weighted post-contrast MRI (in patients only). A modified
k-nearest neighbor segmentation algorithm was optimized for maximum computation
speed and high-quality segmentation. In that regard, we a) discarded the
redundant seed points; b) discarded the points within 0.5 standard deviation from
the cluster center that were non-overlapping with other tissue; and c) removed
outlying seed points outside 5 times the standard deviation from the cluster
center of each tissue class. After segmentation, a stack of color-coded segmented
images was created. Our new technique utilizing all four MRI inputs provided
better segmentation than that based on three inputs (P < 0.001 for MS and P <
0.001 for tumors). The tissues were smoother due to the reduction of statistical 
noise, and the delineation of the tissues became sharper. Details that were
previously blurred or invisible now became apparent. In normal persons a detailed
depiction of deep gray matter nuclei was obtained. In malignant tumors, up to
five abnormal tissue types were identified: 1) solid tumor core, 2) cyst, 3)
edema in white matter 4) edema in gray matter, and 5) necrosis. Delineation of MS
plaque in different stages of demyelination became much sharper. In conclusion,
the proposed methodology warrants further development and clinical evaluation.

In this paper, wavelets were employed for multi-scale image analysis to extract
parameters for the description of chromatin texture in the cytological diagnosis 
and grading of invasive breast cancer. Their value was estimated by comparing the
performance of co-occurrence, densitometric, and morphometric parameters in an
automated K-nearest neighbor (Knn) classification scheme based on light
microscopic images of isolated nuclei of paraffin-embedded tissue. This design
allowed a multifaceted cytological retrospective study of which the practical
value can be judged easily. Results show that wavelets perform excellently with
classification scores comparable with densitometric and co-occurrence features.
Moreover, because wavelets showed a high additive value with the other textural
groups, this panel allowed a very profound description with higher recognition
scores than previously reported (76% for individual nuclei, 100% for cases).
Morphometric parameters performed less well and only slightly increased correct
classification. The major drawback, besides image segmentation errors demanding
operator supervision, emanated to be the few false-negative cases, which restrict
the immediate practical use. However, an enlargement of the parameter set may
avoid this misclassification, resulting in an applicable expert system of
practical use.

In vivo validation of tissue segmentation based on a 3D feature map using both a

man.

USA.

The purpose of this study was to validate our MR tissue segmentation technique
using a hamster brain tumor model and malignant brain tumors in man. We used a
multispectral tissue segmentation analysis. Three sets of MRI data were included:
proton density, T2-weighted fast spin echo, and T1-weighted spin echo, as inputs.
Three image preprocessing steps included correcting image nonuniformity,
application of an anisotropic diffusion type filter, and data point selection by 
a qualified observer. We used the k-Nearest Neighbor segmentation algorithm,
which does not require prior knowledge of the sample distribution. This choice
allowed us to optimize the different tissue clusters present in three-dimensional
(3D) feature space. In vivo validation of the technique was performed in hamsters
harboring tumors induced with JC virus-transformed HJC-15 cells, as compared to
three control animals. Human brain tumors obtained by stereotactically guided
biopsy in six patients were also included in the study. Finally, brain tumors
were removed from two patients who underwent conventional craniotomy using
segmentation-derived images as a guide. In the hamsters, 10 tissues were
correctly identified by segmentation and were confirmed histologically (P < .02).
In the patients, there was also a strong correlation between our segmentation
results and the tissue obtained by stereotactic biopsy (P < .01). In one of the
two patients who underwent open craniotomy, segmentation images were useful in
revealing tumor spread into vital areas of the brain (motor area). In conclusion,
the results of segmentation correlate well with the tissues in vivo and thus
warrant further clinical utilization and evaluation.

Improved intracranial lesion characterization by tissue segmentation based on a
3D feature map.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Radiology, Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, Philadelphia,
PA 19107, USA.

Our aim was to develop an accurate multispectral tissue segmentation method based
on 3D feature maps. We utilized proton density (PD), T2-weighted fast spin-echo
(FSE), and T1-weighted spin-echo images as inputs for segmentation. Phantom
constructs, cadaver brains, an animal brain tumor model and both normal human
brains and those from patients with either multiple sclerosis (MS) or primary
brain tumors were analyzed with this technique. Initially, misregistration, RF
inhomogeneity and image noise problems were addressed. Next, a qualified observer
identified samples representing the tissues of interest. Finally, k-nearest
neighbor algorithm (k-NN) was utilized to create a stack of color-coded segmented
images. The inclusion of T1 based images, as a third input, produced significant 
improvement in the delineation of tissues. In MS, our 3D technique was found to
be far superior to that based on any combination of 2D feature maps (P < 0.001). 
We identified at least two distinctly different classes of lesions within the
same MS plaque, representing different stages of the disease process. Further, we
obtained the regional distribution of MS lesion burden and followed its changes
over time. Neuropsychological aberrations were the clinical counterpart of the
structural changes detected in segmentation. We could also delineate the margins 
of benign brain tumors. In malignant tumors, up to four abnormal tissues were
identified: 1) a solid tumor core, 2) a cystic component, 3) edema in the white
matter, and 4) areas of necrosis and hemorrhage. Subsequent neurosurgical
exploration confirmed the distribution of tissues as predicted by this analysis.

The performance evaluation of a semi-supervised fuzzy c-means (SFCM) clustering
method for monitoring brain tumor volume changes during the course of routine
clinical radiation-therapeutic and chemo-therapeutic regimens is presented. The
tumor volume determined using the SFCM method was compared with the volume
estimates obtained using three other methods: (a) a k nearest neighbor (kNN)
classifier, b) a grey level thresholding and seed growing (ISG-SG) method and c) 
a manual pixel labeling (GT) method for ground truth estimation. The SFCM and kNN
methods are applied to the multispectral, contrast enhanced T1, proton density,
and T2 weighted, magnetic resonance images (MRI) whereas the ISG-SG and GT
methods are applied only to the contrast enhanced T1 weighted image. Estimations 
of tumor volume were made on eight patient cases with follow-up MRI scans
performed over a 32 week interval during treatment. The tumor cases studied
include one meningioma, two brain metastases and five gliomas. Comparisons with
manually labeled ground truth estimations showed that there is a limited
agreement between the segmentation methods for absolute tumor volume measurements
when using images of patients after treatment. The average intraobserver
reproducibility for the SFCM, kNN and ISG-SG methods was found to be 5.8%, 6.6%
and 8.9%, respectively. The average of the interobserver reproducibility of these
methods was found to be 5.5%, 6.5% and 11.4%, respectively. For the measurement
of relative change of tumor volume as required for the response assessment, the
multi-spectral methods kNN and SFCM are therefore preferred over the seedgrowing 
method.

Analysis of mammographic microcalcifications using gray-level image structure
features.

(1)Dept. of Electr. & Comput. Eng., Cincinnati Univ., OH.

At present, mammography associated with clinical breast examination and breast
self-examination is the only effective and viable method for mass breast
screening. The presence of microcalcifications is one of the primary signs of
breast cancer. It is, difficult however, to distinguish between benign and
malignant microcalcifications associated with breast cancer. Here, the authors
define a set of image structure features for classification of malignancy. Two
categories of correlated gray-level image structure features are defined for
classification of "difficult-to-diagnose" cases. The first category of features
includes second-order histogram statistics-based features representing the global
texture and the wavelet decomposition-based features representing the local
texture of the microcalcification area of interest. The second category of
features represents the first-order gray-level histogram-based statistics of the 
segmented microcalcification regions and the size, number, and distance features 
of the segmented microcalcification cluster. Various features in each category
were correlated with the biopsy examination results of 191
"difficult-to-diagnose" cases for selection of the best set of features
representing the complete gray-level image structure information. The selection
of the best features was performed using the multivariate cluster analysis as
well as a genetic algorithm (GA)-based search method. The selected features were 
used for classification using backpropagation neural network and parameteric
statistical classifiers. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was
performed to compare the neural network-based classification with linear and
k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifiers. The neural network classifier yielded
better results using the combined set of features selected through the GA-based
search method for classification of "difficult-to-diagnose" microcalcifications.

Two different multispectral pattern recognition methods are used to segment
magnetic resonance images (MRI) of the brain for quantitative estimation of tumor
volume and volume changes with therapy. A supervised k-nearest neighbor (kNN)
rule and a semi-supervised fuzzy c-means (SFCM) method are used to segment MRI
slice data. Tumor volumes as determined by the kNN and SFCM segmentation methods 
are compared with two reference methods, based on image grey scale, as a basis
for an estimation of ground truth, namely: (a) a commonly used seed growing
method that is applied to the contrast enhanced T1-weighted image, and (b) a
manual segmentation method using a custom-designed graphical user interface
applied to the same raw image (T1-weighted) dataset. Emphasis is placed on
measurement of intra and inter observer reproducibility using the proposed
methods. Intra- and interobserver variation for the kNN method was 9% and 5%,
respectively. The results for the SFCM method was a little better at 6% and 4%,
respectively. For the seed growing method, the intra-observer variation was 6%
and the interobserver variation was 17%, significantly larger when compared with 
the multispectral methods. The absolute tumor volume determined by the
multispectral segmentation methods was consistently smaller than that observed
for the reference methods. The results of this study are found to be very patient
case-dependent. The results for SFCM suggest that it should be useful for
relative measurements of tumor volume during therapy, but further studies are
required. This work demonstrates the need for minimally supervised or
unsupervised methods for tumor volume measurements.

(1)Lillian & Henry M. Stratton-Hans Popper Department of Pathology, Mount Sanai
School of Medicine, City University of New York, New York.

This study was designed to develop a practical morphometric procedure for the
diagnosis of carcinoma in renal aspirates. We studied aspirates from renal cell
carcinomas (grades 1-2) and normal kidneys. Video images of nuclei were traced on
a high-resolution, touch-sensitive screen connected to an image analysis system. 
From each tracing the computer calculated nuclear perimeter length, nuclear
profile area, maximal chord length, and the means and standard deviation for all 
measurements. Size distribution of nuclear profile areas and perimeter length in 
discrete bins ranged, respectively, from 30 to 80 at 10 microns2 intervals for
areas and from 1 to 12 microns at 1-micron intervals for the maximum chords. The 
size distribution plots for the maximal chord of individual nuclei demonstrated
an early narrow peak at low values for normal renal aspirates (peak located in
the class ranging from 7 to 8 microns), while a broader, flatter peak with a
shift to the right and a malignant tail was seen in renal cell carcinoma
aspirates (peak located at 9-10 microns). These data were used for multivariate
analysis to form two categories to establish a data base against which unknown
cases could be tested. Multivariate analysis using a total of 14 variables
yielded a value of 169.1 for the euclidean distances between the center of
clusters of the neoplastic and normal renal aspirates and confirmed the
classification with posterior probabilities of 1.0. From these data, automated
classificatory analysis of 10 unknown cases was performed by means of the
k-nearest neighbor procedure, with correct classification established in each
case.

Two types of endometrial papillary neoplasm. A morphometric study.

Deligdisch L(1), Gil J, Heller D, Cohen CJ.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Mount Sinai Medical Center, New York.

Fourteen cases of Papillary Endometrial Carcinoma (EC) were analyzed by
Interactive Computerized Morphometry. Seven cases were diagnosed as well
differentiated adenocarcinomas with papillary features (PF) and belonged to a
group of EC with associated adenomatous hyperplasia (AH). Seven cases were
diagnosed as uterine papillary serous carcinomas (PA) and belonged to a group of 
EC without associated AH. Two morphometric procedures were used. DRAW for the
characterization of individual nuclei (area, perimeter, chord) and NU-MEAS for
tissue architectural features (crowding and stratification). Using a stepwise
discriminant multifactorial analysis, both methods proved to be accurate for the 
two diagnostic categories, as shown by the 100% posterior probabilities and by
the two diagnostic categories, as shown by the 100% posterior probabilities and
by the distances between group means. A doubtful case was analyzed and classified
using a K-nearest neighbor procedure, compared to the individual case in the
database. The distinction between the two types of papillary EC is important for 
the differential diagnosis of the two lesions. Well differentiated adenocarcinoma
with papillary features is seen usually in the context of a well-differentiated
adenocarcinoma, in a group of patients known to have estrogen-related less
aggressive tumors. Uterine papillary serous carcinoma was described to have a
biological behavior similar to that of papillary ovarian carcinoma and is
encountered in a group of patients with more invasive and less differentiated
EC2. Computerized interactive morphometry is a valuable method to use for the
accuracy of this differential diagnosis in doubtful cases.
