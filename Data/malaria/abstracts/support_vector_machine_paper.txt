Visual inspection for the quantification of malaria parasitaemiain (MP) and
classification of life cycle stage are hard and time taking. Even though,
automated techniques for the quantification of MP and their classification are
reported in the literature. However, either reported techniques are imperfect or 
cannot deal with special issues such as anemia and hemoglobinopathies due to
clumps of red blood cells (RBCs). The focus of the current work is to examine the
thin blood smear microscopic images stained with Giemsa by digital image
processing techniques, grading MP on independent factors (RBCs morphology) and
classification of its life cycle stage. For the classification of the life cycle 
of malaria parasite the k-nearest neighbor, Naïve Bayes and multi-class support
vector machine are employed for classification based on histograms of oriented
gradients and local binary pattern features. The proposed methodology is based on
inductive technique, segment malaria parasites through the adaptive machine
learning techniques. The quantification accuracy of RBCs is enhanced; RBCs clumps
are split by analysis of concavity regions for focal points. Further,
classification of infected and non-infected RBCs has been made to grade MP
precisely. The training and testing of the proposed approach on benchmark dataset
with respect to ground truth data, yield 96.75% MP sensitivity and 94.59%
specificity. Additionally, the proposed approach addresses the process with
independent factors (RBCs morphology). Finally, it is an economical solution for 
MP grading in immense testing.

Species of Aspidosperma are traditionally used to treat malaria, leishmaniasis,
microbial, and inflammatory diseases. Aspidosperma subincanum Mart. known as
"guatambu" is used in Brazilian traditional medicine to treat diabetes,
hypercholesterolemia, and digestive diseases. Its tonic properties have been
employed by the indigenous populations to stimulate the circulatory and
genitourinary tracts and to improve respiratory function as well as to relieve
spasms and to reduce fever. The species is known to contain antitumoural and
antimalarial indole alkaloids. In the present study, various less explored
biological activities of extracts from leaves and branches of A. subincanum were 
investigated, that is, inhibition of acetylcholinesterase as well as antioxidant 
and antibacterial activity. Twenty-one known indole alkaloids from this species
were targeted for predicting the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, and their
biological activities were collected from the literature. Through in silico the
prediction, the indole alkaloids uleine and derivatives demonstrated a strong
probability of being able to inhibit the acetylcholinesterase enzyme, as well as 
the olivacine derivatives 3,4-dihydroolivacine and N-methyl-tetrahydro-olivacine 
(guatambuine), and the subincanadines C and E. Indeed, the extracts of
A. subincanum showed acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity, antioxidant
activity in the lipid peroxidation assay, and antimicrobial activity against
Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, and their pharmacological properties should be 
explored further.

Accurate and immediate diagnosis of malaria is important for medication of the
infectious disease. Conventional methods for diagnosing malaria are time
consuming and rely on the skill of experts. Therefore, an automatic and simple
diagnostic modality is essential for healthcare in developing countries that lack
the expertise of trained microscopists. In the present study, a new automatic
sensing method using digital in-line holographic microscopy (DIHM) combined with 
machine learning algorithms was proposed to sensitively detect unstained
malaria-infected red blood cells (iRBCs). To identify the RBC characteristics, 13
descriptors were extracted from segmented holograms of individual RBCs. Among the
13 descriptors, 10 features were highly statistically different between healthy
RBCs (hRBCs) and iRBCs. Six machine learning algorithms were applied to
effectively combine the dominant features and to greatly improve the diagnostic
capacity of the present method. Among the classification models trained by the 6 
tested algorithms, the model trained by the support vector machine (SVM) showed
the best accuracy in separating hRBCs and iRBCs for training (n = 280, 96.78%)
and testing sets (n = 120, 97.50%). This DIHM-based artificial intelligence
methodology is simple and does not require blood staining. Thus, it will be
beneficial and valuable in the diagnosis of malaria.

Machine learning methods have been applied to many data sets in pharmaceutical
research for several decades. The relative ease and availability of fingerprint
type molecular descriptors paired with Bayesian methods resulted in the
widespread use of this approach for a diverse array of end points relevant to
drug discovery. Deep learning is the latest machine learning algorithm attracting
attention for many of pharmaceutical applications from docking to virtual
screening. Deep learning is based on an artificial neural network with multiple
hidden layers and has found considerable traction for many artificial
intelligence applications. We have previously suggested the need for a comparison
of different machine learning methods with deep learning across an array of
varying data sets that is applicable to pharmaceutical research. End points
relevant to pharmaceutical research include absorption, distribution, metabolism,
excretion, and toxicity (ADME/Tox) properties, as well as activity against
pathogens and drug discovery data sets. In this study, we have used data sets for
solubility, probe-likeness, hERG, KCNQ1, bubonic plague, Chagas, tuberculosis,
and malaria to compare different machine learning methods using FCFP6
fingerprints. These data sets represent whole cell screens, individual proteins, 
physicochemical properties as well as a data set with a complex end point. Our
aim was to assess whether deep learning offered any improvement in testing when
assessed using an array of metrics including AUC, F1 score, Cohen's kappa,
Matthews correlation coefficient and others. Based on ranked normalized scores
for the metrics or data sets Deep Neural Networks (DNN) ranked higher than SVM,
which in turn was ranked higher than all the other machine learning methods.
Visualizing these properties for training and test sets using radar type plots
indicates when models are inferior or perhaps over trained. These results also
suggest the need for assessing deep learning further using multiple metrics with 
much larger scale comparisons, prospective testing as well as assessment of
different fingerprints and DNN architectures beyond those used.

BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum infections are especially severe in pregnant
women because infected erythrocytes (IE) express VAR2CSA, a ligand that binds to 
placental trophoblasts, causing IE to accumulate in the placenta. Resulting
inflammation and pathology increases a woman's risk of anemia, miscarriage,
premature deliveries, and having low birthweight (LBW) babies. Antibodies (Ab) to
VAR2CSA reduce placental parasitaemia and improve pregnancy outcomes. Currently, 
no single assay is able to predict if a woman has adequate immunity to prevent
placental malaria (PM). This study measured Ab levels to 28 malarial antigens and
used the data to develop statistical models for predicting if a woman has
sufficient immunity to prevent PM.
METHODS: Archival plasma samples from 1377 women were screened in a bead-based
multiplex assay for Ab to 17 VAR2CSA-associated antigens (full length VAR2CSA
(FV2), DBL 1-6 of the FCR3, 3D7 and 7G8 lines, ID1-ID2a (FCR3 and 3D7) and 11
antigens that have been reported to be associated with immunity to P. falciparum 
(AMA-1, CSP, EBA-175, LSA1, MSP1, MSP2, MSP3, MSP11, Pf41, Pf70 and RESA)). Ab
levels along with clinical variables (age, gravidity) were used in the following 
seven statistical approaches: logistic regression full model, logistic regression
reduced model, recursive partitioning, random forests, linear discriminant
analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis, and support vector machine.
RESULTS: The best and simplest model proved to be the logistic regression reduced
model. AMA-1, MSP2, EBA-175, Pf41, and MSP11 were found to be the top five most
important predictors for the PM status based on overall prediction performance.
CONCLUSIONS: Not surprising, significant differences were observed between PM
positive (PM+) and PM negative (PM-) groups for Ab levels to the majority of
malaria antigens. Individually though, these malarial antigens did not achieve
reasonably high performances in terms of predicting the PM status. Utilizing
multiple antigens in predictive models considerably improved discrimination power
compared to individual assays. Among seven different classifiers considered, the 
reduced logistic regression model produces the best overall predictive
performance.

Background: Pediatric acute respiratory distress in tropical settings is very
common. Bacterial pneumonia is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality
rates and requires adequate diagnosis for correct treatment. A rapid test that
could identify bacterial (vs other) infections would have great clinical utility.
Methods and Results: We performed RNA (RNA-seq) sequencing and analyzed the
transcriptomes of 68 pediatric patients with well-characterized clinical
phenotype to identify transcriptional features associated with each disease
class. We refined the features to predictive models (support vector machine,
elastic net) and validated those models in an independent test set of 37 patients
(80%-85% accuracy).
Conclusions: We have identified sets of genes that are differentially expressed
in pediatric patients with pneumonia syndrome attributable to different
infections and requiring different therapeutic interventions. Findings of this
study demonstrate that human transcription signatures in infected patients
recapitulate the underlying biology and provide models for predicting a bacterial
diagnosis to inform treatment.

Plasmodium falciparum, the most fatal parasite that causes malaria, is
responsible for over one million deaths per year. P. falciparum dihydroorotate
dehydrogenase (PfDHODH) has been validated as a promising drug development target
for antimalarial therapy since it catalyzes the rate-limiting step for DNA and
RNA biosynthesis. In this study, we investigated the quantitative
structure-activity relationships (QSAR) of the antimalarial activity of PfDHODH
inhibitors by generating four computational models using a multilinear regression
(MLR) and a support vector machine (SVM) based on a dataset of 255 PfDHODH
inhibitors. All the models display good prediction quality with a leave-one-out
q(2) >0.66, a correlation coefficient (r) >0.85 on both training sets and test
sets, and a mean square error (MSE) <0.32 on training sets and <0.37 on test
sets, respectively. The study indicated that the hydrogen bonding ability, atom
polarizabilities and ring complexity are predominant factors for inhibitors'
antimalarial activity. The models are capable of predicting inhibitors'
antimalarial activity and the molecular descriptors for building the models could
be helpful in the development of new antimalarial drugs.

Identification of the proteins secreted by the malaria parasite is important for 
developing effective drugs and vaccines against infection. Therefore, we
developed an improved predictor called "DSPMP" (Discriminating Secretory Proteins
of Malaria Parasite) to identify the secretory proteins of the malaria parasite
by integrating several vector features using support vector machine-based
methods. DSPMP achieved an overall predictive accuracy of 98.61%, which is
superior to that of the existing predictors in this field. We show that our
method is capable of identifying the secretory proteins of the malaria parasite
and found that the amino acid composition for buried and exposed sequences,
denoted by AAC(b/e), was the most important feature for constructing the
predictor. This article not only introduces a novel method for detecting the
important features of sample proteins related to the malaria parasite but also
provides a useful tool for tackling general protein-related problems. The DSPMP

RATIONALE: Plasma-detectable biomarkers that rapidly and accurately diagnose
bacterial infections in children with suspected pneumonia could reduce the
morbidity of respiratory disease and decrease the unnecessary use of antibiotic
therapy.
OBJECTIVES: Using 56 markers measured in a multiplexed immunoassay, we sought to 
identify proteins and protein combinations that could discriminate bacterial from
viral or malarial diagnoses.
METHODS: We selected 80 patients with clinically diagnosed pneumonia (as defined 
by the World Health Organization) who also met criteria for bacterial, viral, or 
malarial infection based on clinical, radiographic, and laboratory results. Ten
healthy community control subjects were enrolled to assess marker reliability.
Patients were subdivided into two sets: one for identifying potential markers and
another for validating them.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Three proteins (haptoglobin, tumor necrosis factor
receptor 2 or IL-10, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1) were
identified that, when combined through a classification tree signature,
accurately classified patients into bacterial, malarial, and viral etiologies and
misclassified only one patient with bacterial pneumonia from the validation set. 
The overall sensitivity and specificity of this signature for the bacterial
diagnosis were 96 and 86%, respectively. Alternative combinations of markers with
comparable accuracy were selected by support vector machine and regression models
and included haptoglobin, IL-10, and creatine kinase-MB.
CONCLUSIONS: Combinations of plasma proteins accurately identified children with 
a respiratory syndrome who were likely to have bacterial infections and who would
benefit from antibiotic therapy. When used in conjunction with malaria diagnostic
tests, they may improve diagnostic specificity and simplify treatment decisions
for clinicians.

BACKGROUND: Malaria is the world's most prevalent vector-borne disease. Accurate 
prediction of malaria outbreaks may lead to public health interventions that
mitigate disease morbidity and mortality.
METHODS: We describe an application of a method for creating prediction models
utilizing Fuzzy Association Rule Mining to extract relationships between
epidemiological, meteorological, climatic, and socio-economic data from Korea.
These relationships are in the form of rules, from which the best set of rules is
automatically chosen and forms a classifier. Two classifiers have been built and 
their results fused to become a malaria prediction model. Future malaria cases
are predicted as Low, Medium or High, where these classes are defined as a total 
of 0-2, 3-16, and above 17 cases, respectively, for a region in South Korea
during a two-week period. Based on user recommendations, HIGH is considered an
outbreak.
RESULTS: Model accuracy is described by Positive Predictive Value (PPV),
Sensitivity, and F-score for each class, computed on test data not previously
used to develop the model. For predictions made 7-8 weeks in advance, model PPV
and Sensitivity are 0.842 and 0.681, respectively, for the HIGH classes. The F0.5
and F3 scores (which combine PPV and Sensitivity) are 0.804 and 0.694,
respectively, for the HIGH classes. The overall FARM results (as measured by
F-scores) are significantly better than those obtained by Decision Tree, Random
Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Holt-Winters methods for the HIGH class. For 
the Medium class, Random Forest and FARM obtain comparable results, with FARM
being better at F0.5, and Random Forest obtaining a higher F3.
CONCLUSIONS: A previously described method for creating disease prediction models
has been modified and extended to build models for predicting malaria. In
addition, some new input variables were used, including indicators of
intervention measures. The South Korea malaria prediction models predict Low,
Medium or High cases 7-8 weeks in the future. This paper demonstrates that our
data driven approach can be used for the prediction of different diseases.

The Chagas disease is a potentially life-threatening illness caused by the
protozoan parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi. Visual detection of such parasite through 
microscopic inspection is a tedious and time-consuming task. In this paper, we
provide an AdaBoost learning solution to the task of Chagas parasite detection in
blood images. We give details of the algorithm and our experimental setup. With
this method, we get 100% and 93.25% of sensitivity and specificity, respectively.
A ROC comparison with the method most commonly used for the detection of malaria 
parasites based on support vector machines (SVM) is also provided. Our
experimental work shows mainly two things: (1) Chagas parasites can be detected
automatically using machine learning methods with high accuracy and (2) AdaBoost 
+ SVM provides better overall detection performance than AdaBoost or SVMs alone. 
Such results are the best ones known so far for the problem of automatic
detection of Chagas parasites through the use of machine learning, computer
vision, and image processing methods.

Falcipain-3 (FP-3) is a cysteine protease of the malaria parasite Plasmodium
falciparum which is a promising and attractive target enzyme for antiparasitic
chemotherapy. In this study, a support vector machine (SVM) model based on
fingerprint-based descriptors was developed on a dataset of 239 FP-3 inhibitors
to identify the most active antimalarial compounds among the active compounds
provided from similarity search. The satisfactory classification performance
achieved by the SVM model shows its ability to use it as a further filter to
distinguish the most active compounds. The accuracy in prediction for the
training, test and external validation sets were 97.39%, 94.74% and 90.6%,
respectively. Furthermore, the performance of the model was examined by plotting 
the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and the area under the ROC
curve was 0.96 for the modeling set. The ability of a virtual screening scheme to
scaffold hopping or lead hopping is known as a key ability of an effective method
for virtual screening. Three diverse reference FP-3 structures were chosen as
active antimalarial compounds to search the lead-like database of ZINC and
retrieve the most similar compounds. Compounds having Tanimoto similarity
coefficient above 0.8 were extracted for further analysis by classification
model. The SVM model rendered five most active compounds and they were also
analyzed by ADME/Tox and diversity measures. Maximum property-based distance
between extracted compounds was found to be 0.70, which shows the importance of
applying multiple diverse reference compounds in the similarity searching.

INTRODUCTION: Microscopy is the gold standard for diagnosis of malaria, however, 
manual evaluation of blood films is highly dependent on skilled personnel in a
time-consuming, error-prone and repetitive process. In this study we propose a
method using computer vision detection and visualization of only the
diagnostically most relevant sample regions in digitized blood smears.
METHODS: Giemsa-stained thin blood films with P. falciparum ring-stage
trophozoites (n = 27) and uninfected controls (n = 20) were digitally scanned
with an oil immersion objective (0.1 µm/pixel) to capture approximately 50,000
erythrocytes per sample. Parasite candidate regions were identified based on
color and object size, followed by extraction of image features (local binary
patterns, local contrast and Scale-invariant feature transform descriptors) used 
as input to a support vector machine classifier. The classifier was trained on
digital slides from ten patients and validated on six samples.
RESULTS: The diagnostic accuracy was tested on 31 samples (19 infected and 12
controls). From each digitized area of a blood smear, a panel with the 128 most
probable parasite candidate regions was generated. Two expert microscopists were 
asked to visually inspect the panel on a tablet computer and to judge whether the
patient was infected with P. falciparum. The method achieved a diagnostic
sensitivity and specificity of 95% and 100% as well as 90% and 100% for the two
readers respectively using the diagnostic tool. Parasitemia was separately
calculated by the automated system and the correlation coefficient between manual
and automated parasitemia counts was 0.97.
CONCLUSION: We developed a decision support system for detecting malaria
parasites using a computer vision algorithm combined with visualization of sample
areas with the highest probability of malaria infection. The system provides a
novel method for blood smear screening with a significantly reduced need for
visual examination and has a potential to increase the throughput in malaria
diagnostics.

Using a unique combination of visual, statistical, and data mining methods, we
tested the hypothesis that an immune cell's movement pattern can convey key
information about the cell's function, antigen specificity, and environment. We
applied clustering, statistical tests, and a support vector machine (SVM) to
assess our ability to classify different datasets of imaged flouresently labelled
T cells in mouse liver. We additionally saw clusters of different movement
patterns of T cells of identical antigenic specificity. We found that the
movement patterns of T cells specific and non-specific for malaria parasites are 
differentiable with 72% accuracy, and that specific cells have a higher tendency 
to move towards the parasite than non-specific cells. Movements of
antigen-specific T cells in uninfected mice vs. infected mice were differentiable
with 69.8% accuracy. We additionally saw clusters of different movement patterns 
of T cells of identical antigenic specificity. We concluded that our combination 
of methods has the potential to advance the understanding of cell movements in
vivo.

Plasmodium falciparum glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (PfG6PD) has been
considered as a potential target for severe forms of anti-malaria therapy. In
this study, several classification models were built to distinguish active and
weakly active PfG6PD inhibitors by support vector machine method. Each molecule
was initially represented by 1,044 molecular descriptors calculated by
ADRIANA.Code. Correlation analysis and attribute selection methods in Weka were
used to get the best reduced set of molecular descriptors, respectively. The best
model (Model 2w) gave a prediction accuracy (Q) of 93.88 % and a Matthew's
correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.88 on the test set. Some properties such as
[Formula: see text] atom charge, [Formula: see text] atom charge, and lone pair
electronegativity-related descriptors are important for the interaction between
the PfG6PD and the inhibitor.

The aim of this paper is to address the development of computer assisted malaria 
parasite characterization and classification using machine learning approach
based on light microscopic images of peripheral blood smears. In doing this,
microscopic image acquisition from stained slides, illumination correction and
noise reduction, erythrocyte segmentation, feature extraction, feature selection 
and finally classification of different stages of malaria (Plasmodium vivax and
Plasmodium falciparum) have been investigated. The erythrocytes are segmented
using marker controlled watershed transformation and subsequently total ninety
six features describing shape-size and texture of erythrocytes are extracted in
respect to the parasitemia infected versus non-infected cells. Ninety four
features are found to be statistically significant in discriminating six classes.
Here a feature selection-cum-classification scheme has been devised by combining 
F-statistic, statistical learning techniques i.e., Bayesian learning and support 
vector machine (SVM) in order to provide the higher classification accuracy using
best set of discriminating features. Results show that Bayesian approach provides
the highest accuracy i.e., 84% for malaria classification by selecting 19 most
significant features while SVM provides highest accuracy i.e., 83.5% with 9 most 
significant features. Finally, the performance of these two classifiers under
feature selection framework has been compared toward malaria parasite
classification.

Research, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Laarbeeklaan 103, B-1090 Brussels, Belgium.

This paper describes the construction of a QSAR model to relate the structures of
various derivatives of neocryptolepine to their anti-malarial activities. QSAR
classification models were build using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA),
Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), Classification and Regression Trees
(CART), Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA), Orthogonal
Projections to Latent Structures-Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA), and Support
Vector Machines for Classification (SVM-C), using four sets of molecular
descriptors as explanatory variables. Prior to classification, the molecules were
divided into a training and a test set using the duplex algorithm. The different 
classification models were compared regarding their predictive ability,
simplicity, and interpretability. Both binary and multi-class classification
models were constructed. For classification into three classes, CART and
One-Against-One (OAO)-SVM-C were found to be the best predictive methods, while
for classification into two classes, LDA, QDA and CART were.

The emergence and spread of Plasmodium falciparum resistance to existing
antimalarials emphasize the impelling search for novel drug targets and
chemotherapeutic compounds. The ubiquitin-proteasome system plays a major role in
overall protein turnover, in eukaryotic cells including plasmodia. 20S β subunit 
is the catalytic core of this proteolytic machinery, and hence most of the
inhibitors developed are being targeted towards this component. Inhibition of the
proteasome is established as a promising strategy to develop novel antimalarial
drugs. The present study reports identification of novel drug-like 20S proteasome
inhibitors with potential activity against the 20S β subunit of P. falciparum
using a combination of ligand based (Support Vector Machines) and receptor based 
(molecular docking) techniques. The robust learning and generalizing capability
of Support Vector Machines (SVM) has been exploited to classify proteasome
inhibitors and non-inhibitors, targeted towards P. falciparum 20S proteasome. SVM
model has been trained using 170 molecular descriptors of 64 inhibitors and 208
putative non-inhibitors of 20S proteasome. The non-linear classifier based on
Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel yielded highest classification accuracy in
comparison to the linear classifier. The best classifier had 5-fold
Cross-Validation (CV) accuracy of 97% and Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.99
reflecting good accuracy of the model. The SVM model rapidly classified compounds
with potential proteasomal activity. Subsequently, molecular docking studies
aided the generation of focused collection of compounds with good binding
affinity towards the substrate-binding site of 20S β subunit. The novel drug-like
20S proteasome inhibitors identified in this study can be a good starting point
to develop novel antimalarial drugs.

Mito-GSAAC: mitochondria prediction using genetic ensemble classifier and split
amino acid composition.

Engineering and Applied Sciences, Nilore, Islamabad, Pakistan.

Mitochondria are all-important organelles of eukaryotic cells since they are
involved in processes associated with cellular mortality and human diseases.
Therefore, trustworthy techniques are highly required for the identification of
new mitochondrial proteins. We propose Mito-GSAAC system for prediction of
mitochondrial proteins. The aim of this work is to investigate an effective
feature extraction strategy and to develop an ensemble approach that can better
exploit the advantages of this feature extraction strategy for mitochondria
classification. We investigate four kinds of protein representations for
prediction of mitochondrial proteins: amino acid composition, dipeptide
composition, pseudo amino acid composition, and split amino acid composition
(SAAC). Individual classifiers such as support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest
neighbor, multilayer perceptron, random forest, AdaBoost, and bagging are first
trained. An ensemble classifier is then built using genetic programming (GP) for 
evolving a complex but effective decision space from the individual decision
spaces of the trained classifiers. The highest prediction performance for
Jackknife test is 92.62% using GP-based ensemble classifier on SAAC features,
which is the highest accuracy, reported so far on the Mitochondria dataset being 
used. While on the Malaria Parasite Mitochondria dataset, the highest accuracy is
obtained by SVM using SAAC and it is further enhanced to 93.21% using GP-based
ensemble. It is observed that SAAC has better discrimination power for
mitochondria prediction over the rest of the feature extraction strategies. Thus,
the improved prediction performance is largely due to the better capability of
SAAC for discriminating between mitochondria and non-mitochondria proteins at the
N and C terminus and the effective combination capability of GP. Mito-GSAAC can
be accessed at http://111.68.99.218/Mito-GSAAC . It is expected that the novel
approach and the accompanied predictor will have a major impact to Molecular Cell
Biology, Proteomics, Bioinformatics, System Biology, and Drug Development.

The rate of human death due to malaria is increasing day-by-day. Thus the malaria
causing parasite Plasmodium falciparum (PF) remains the cause of concern. With
the wealth of data now available, it is imperative to understand protein
localization in order to gain deeper insight into their functional roles. In this
manuscript, an attempt has been made to develop prediction method for the
localization of mitochondrial proteins. In this study, we describe a method for
predicting mitochondrial proteins of malaria parasite using machine-learning
technique. All models were trained and tested on 175 proteins (40 mitochondrial
and 135 non-mitochondrial proteins) and evaluated using five-fold cross
validation. We developed a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for predicting
mitochondrial proteins of P. falciparum, using amino acids and dipeptides
composition and achieved maximum MCC 0.38 and 0.51, respectively. In this study, 
split amino acid composition (SAAC) is used where composition of N-termini,
C-termini, and rest of protein is computed separately. The performance of SVM
model improved significantly from MCC 0.38 to 0.73 when SAAC instead of simple
amino acid composition was used as input. In addition, SVM model has been
developed using composition of PSSM profile with MCC 0.75 and accuracy 91.38%. We
achieved maximum MCC 0.81 with accuracy 92% using a hybrid model, which combines 
PSSM profile and SAAC. When evaluated on an independent dataset our method
performs better than existing methods. A web server PFMpred has been developed
for predicting mitochondrial proteins of malaria parasites (

MAAP: malarial adhesins and adhesin-like proteins predictor.

Malaria caused by protozoan parasites belonging to the genus Plasmodium is a
dreaded disease, second only to tuberculosis. The emergence of parasites
resistant to commonly used drugs and the lack of availability of vaccines
aggravates the problem. One of the preventive approaches targets adhesion of
parasites to host cells and tissues. Adhesion of parasites is mediated by
proteins called adhesins. Abrogation of adhesion by either immunizing the host
with adhesins or inhibiting the interaction using structural analogs of host cell
receptors holds the potential to develop novel preventive strategies. The
availability of complete genome sequence offers new opportunities for identifying
adhesin and adhesin-like proteins. Development of computational algorithms can
simplify this task and accelerate experimental characterization of the predicted 
adhesins from complete genomes. A curated positive dataset of experimentally
known adhesins from Plasmodium species was prepared by careful examination of
literature reports. "Controversial" or "hypothetical" adhesins were excluded. The
negative dataset consisted of proteins representing various intracellular
functions including information processing, metabolism, and interface
(transporters). We did not include proteins likely to be on the surface with
unknown adhesin properties or which are linked even indirectly to the adhesion
process in either of the training sets. A nonhomology-based approach using 420
compositional properties of amino acid dipeptide and multiplet frequencies was
used to develop MAAP Web server with Support Vector Machine (SVM) model
classifier as its engine for the prediction of malarial adhesins and adhesin-like
proteins. The MAAP engine has six SVM classifier models identified through an
exhaustive search from 728 kernel parameters set. These models displayed an
efficiency (Mathews correlation coefficient) of 0.860-0.967. The final prediction
P(maap) score is the maximum score attained by a given sequence in any of the six
models. The results of MAAP runs on complete proteomes of Plasmodium species
revealed that in Plasmodium falciparum at P(maap) scores above 0.0, we observed a
sensitivity of 100% with two false positives. In P. vivax and P. yoelii an
optimal threshold P(maap) score of 0.7 was optimal with very few false positives 
(upto 5). Several new predictions were obtained. This list includes hypothetical 
protein PF14_0040, interspersed repeat antigen, STEVOR, liver stage antigen,
SURFIN, RIFIN, stevor (3D7-stevorT3-2), mature parasite-infected erythrocyte
surface antigen or P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 2, merozoite
surface protein 6 in P. falciparum, circumsporozoite proteins, microneme
protein-1, Vir18, Vir12-like, Vir12, Vir18-like, Vir18-related and Vir4 in P.
vivax, circumsporozoite protein/thrombospondin related anonymous proteins, 28 kDa
ookinete surface protein, yir1, and yir4 of P. yoelii. Among these, a few
proteins identified by MAAP were matched with those identified by other groups
using different experimental and theoretical strategies. Most other interspersed 
repeat proteins in Plasmodium species had lower P(maap) scores. These new
predictions could serve as new leads for further experimental characterization
(MAAP webserver: http://maap.igib.res.in).
