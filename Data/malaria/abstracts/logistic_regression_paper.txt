BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends combinations of an
artemisinin derivative plus an anti-malarial drug of longer half-life as
treatment options for uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum infections. In Africa, 
artesunate-mefloquine (ASMQ) is an infrequently used artemisinin-based
combination therapy (ACT) because of perceived poor tolerance to mefloquine.
However, the WHO has recommended reconsideration of the use of ASMQ in Africa. In
this large clinical study, the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a fixed dose combination 
of ASMQ was investigated in an African paediatric population to support dosing
recommendations used in Southeast Asia and South America.
METHODS: Among the 472 paediatric patients aged 6-59 months from six African
centres included in the large clinical trial, a subset of 50 Kenyan children
underwent intensive sampling to develop AS, its metabolite dihydroartemisinin
(DHA) and MQ PK models. The final MQ PK model was validated using sparse data
collected in the remaining participants (NONMEM®). The doses were one or two
tablets containing 25/55 mg AS/MQ administered once a day for 3 days according to
patients' age. A sensitive LC-MS/MS method was used to quantify AS, DHA and MQ
concentrations in plasma. An attempt was made to investigate the relationship
between the absence/presence of malaria recrudescence and MQ area under the curve
(AUC) using logistic regression.
RESULTS: AS/DHA concentration-time profiles were best described using a
one-compartment model for both compounds with irreversible AS conversion into
DHA. AS/DHA PK were characterized by a significant degree of variability. Body
weight affected DHA PK parameters. MQ PK was characterized by a two-compartment
model and a large degree of variability. Allometric scaling of MQ clearances and 
volumes of distribution was used to depict the relationship between MQ PK and
body weight. No association was found between the model predicted AUC and
appearance of recrudescence.
CONCLUSIONS: The population pharmacokinetic models developed for both AS/DHA and 
MQ showed a large variability in drug exposure in the investigated African
paediatric population. The largest contributor to this variability was body
weight, which is accommodated for by the ASMQ fixed dose combination (FDC) dosing
recommendation. Besides body weight considerations, there is no indication that
the dosage should be modified in children with malaria compared to adults. Trial

Early diagnosis and treatment of childhood fever, an important sign of
potentially serious infections such as malaria, is essential for controlling
disease progression, and ultimately, preventing deaths. This study examined
individual- and community-level factors associated with treatment-seeking
behaviors and promptness in these behaviors among caregivers of febrile
under-five children in Malawi. The 2015-2016 Malawi Demographic Health Survey was
used to analyze a nationally representative sample of 4,133 under-five children
who had fever within 2 weeks before the survey. A multilevel logistic regression 
model was used to examine the association between individual- and community-level
factors and treatment-seeking behaviors. Approximately 67.3% of the caregivers
reported seeking treatment for their febrile child, whereas only 46.3% reported
promptly seeking treatment. Children from communities with moderate and high
percentages of educated caregivers were more likely to be taken for treatment
(adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.01-1.58 and aOR = 1.31, 95% CI =
1.02-1.70, respectively) than those from communities with a low percentage of
educated caregivers. Children from communities with moderate and high percentages
of caregivers complaining about the distance to a health facility were less
likely to be taken for treatment (aOR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.58-0.96 and aOR = 0.67, 
95% CI = 0.51-0.88, respectively). At the individual level, having a cough in the
last 2 weeks, region, religion, and having better health behaviors in other
health dimensions were associated with fever treatment-seeking behaviors among
Malawian caregivers. Programs aimed at improving treatment-seeking behaviors
should consider these factors and the regional variations observed in this study.

BACKGROUND: Malaria is an increasing concern in Indonesia. Socio-demographic
factors were found to strongly influence malaria prevalence. This research aimed 
to explore the associations between socio-demographic factors and malaria
prevalence in Indonesia.
METHODS: The study used a cross-sectional design and analysed relationships among
the explanatory variables of malaria prevalence in five endemic provinces using
multivariable logistic regression.
RESULTS: The analysis of baseline socio-demographic data revealed the following
independent risk variables related to malaria prevalence: gender, age,
occupation, knowledge of the availability of healthcare services, measures taken 
to protect from mosquito bites, and housing condition of study participants.
Multivariable analysis showed that participants who were unaware of the
availability of health facilities were 4.2 times more likely to have malaria than
those who were aware of the health facilities (adjusted odds ratio = 4.18; 95% CI
1.52-11.45; P = 0.005).
CONCLUSIONS: Factors that can be managed and would favour malaria elimination
include a range of prevention behaviours at the individual level and using the
networks at the community level of primary healthcare centres. This study
suggests that improving the availability of a variety of health facilities in
endemic areas, information about their services, and access to these is
essential.

BACKGROUND: Preterm birth (PTB) is a leading cause of neonatal mortality and
longer-term morbidity. Acute chorioamnionitis (ACA) is a common cause of PTB,
however, there are limited data on the prevalence of ACA and its association with
PTB in resource limited settings.
METHODS: Data and samples came from a clinical trial evaluating novel strategies 
for the prevention of malaria in HIV infected pregnant women in Uganda. Women
were enrolled between 12-28 weeks of gestation and followed through delivery. For
each placenta delivered, three placental tissue types (membrane roll, umbilical
cord and chorionic plate/villous parenchyma) were collected. Slides were assessed
for diagnosis of maternal and fetal ACA by microscopic evaluation of neutrophilic
infiltration using a standardized grading scale. The primary outcomes were PTB
(<37 weeks), low birth weight (LBW, <2500 grams), and small-for-gestational age
(SGA, birth weight <10th percentile for age). Univariate and multivariate
logistic regression were used to estimate associations between 1) maternal
characteristics (age, education, wealth, gravidity, gestational age at
enrollment, placental malaria, anti-malarial prophylaxis treatment regimen, HIV
disease parameters) and ACA, and 2) associations between ACA and adverse birth
outcomes.
FINDINGS: A total of 193 placentas were included in the analysis. The prevalence 
of maternal and fetal ACA was 44.5% and 28.0%, respectively. HIV infected women
between 28-43 years of age had a higher risk of maternal ACA compared to those
between 17-21 years of age (50.9% vs. 19.1%; aOR = 4.00 (1.10-14.5), p = 0.04)
and the diagnosis of severe maternal ACA was associated with a significantly
higher risk of PTB (28.6% vs. 6.0%; aOR = 6.04 (1.87-19.5), p = 0.003), LBW
(33.3% vs. 9.4%; aOR = 4.86 (1.65-14.3); p = 0.004), and SGA (28.6% vs. 10.1%;
aOR = 3.70 (1.20-11.4), p = 0.02). No maternal characteristics were significantly
associated with fetal ACA and the diagnosis of fetal ACA was not associated with 
adverse birth outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Histological evidence of severe maternal ACA was associated with an 
increased risk of PTB, LBW, and SGA in HIV infected, pregnant Ugandan women.

Bamako.

Intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) with 3 or more doses of
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is recommended by the World Health Organization to
prevent malaria in pregnant women living in high-risk areas. According to the
2015 malaria indicator survey in Mali, malaria prevalence is 34.6%. The high risk
of malaria among pregnant women and children led the Malian government to provide
free SP during antenatal clinics visits. The Malian National Program of Malaria
Control recommends at least 3 doses during pregnancy. The proportion of pregnant 
women taking 3 or more doses of IPTp-SP (IPTp 3+) still remains low. In Mali,
only 36.7% of pregnant women with a live birth in the past 2 yr received IPTp 3+.
To investigate the factors associated with this low coverage, we carried out a
secondary data analysis using the database of the Mali 2015 Malaria Indicator
Survey. Multiple logistic regression was used to analyze these factors among
2,382 interviewed women. Taking less than 3 doses was higher among women below 20
yr (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.43, 95% confidence interval [CI, 1.03; 1.98]); 
however, media accessibility (listening to radio) (AOR = 0.71, 95% CI
[0.53-0.95]) and residing in Segou (AOR = 0.56, 95% CI [0.35-0.90]) seem to favor
the opposite after adjusting the potential confusion. Residence, educational
level, and wealth index were not statistically associated with taking 3 doses of 
IPTp-SP. This study identifies that women less than 20 yr of age were
significantly associated with taking lower than 3 doses of IPTp-SP.

BACKGROUND: To reduce the malaria burden in Nigeria, the National Malaria
Strategic Plan (NMSP) 2014‒2020 calls for the scale-up of prevention and
treatment interventions, including social and behaviour change (SBC). SBC
interventions can increase awareness and improve the demand for and uptake of
malaria interventions. However, there is limited evidence supporting the
implementation of SBC interventions to improve key malaria behaviours, such as
insecticide-treated bed net (ITN) use, among children in Nigeria.
METHODS: Using data from 2015 Nigeria Malaria Indicator Survey, this study used
multiple logistic regression to assess the relationship between caregiver
exposure to malaria messages and ITN use among children under five.
RESULTS: Caregiver exposure to ITN-related messages was significantly associated 
with ITN use among children under five (odds ratio [OR] = 1.63, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that caregiver exposure to topic-specific SBC
messages improves the use of ITNs among children. Given these results, Nigeria
should strive to scale up SBC interventions to help increase ITN use among
children in line with the objectives of the NMSP. Further evidence is needed to
determine which SBC interventions are the most effective and scalable in Nigeria.

BACKGROUND: Literature on health events in HIV-infected travellers is scarce,
particularly in sub-Saharan African (SSA) migrants.
METHODS: We investigated health events in HIV-infected SSA migrants living in
France during and after travel to their native country. All had a pre-travel
plasma viral load (pVL) below 200 copies/mL and were on stable combined
antiretroviral therapy (cART). Logistic regression models were used to assess the
risk factors for at least one adverse health event or febrile event.
RESULTS: Among 264 HIV migrants, pre-travel median CD4 count was 439/mm3 and 27
migrants (6%) experienced a low-level viremia between 50 and 200 copies/mL. One
hundred (38%) experienced at least one event (13 experienced two events). The
most common events were gastrointestinal, including diarrhoea (n = 29, 26%),
respiratory events (n = 20, 18%), and malaria (n = 17, 15%; 1 death). In
multivariable analysis, a pre-travel low-level viremia and a lack of pre-travel
medical advice significantly increased the risk for any event (OR 4.31, 95% CI,
1.41-13.1; and OR 3.62, 95% CI, 1.38-9.47; respectively). A lack of pre-travel
advice significantly increased the risk for febrile event.
CONCLUSIONS: Early and tailored counselling on pre-travel medical advice
regarding diarrhoea and vector-borne diseases prophylactic measures in
HIV-infected SSA migrants should be emphasised before travel to Africa.

BACKGROUND: Malaria is still an important parasitic infectious disease that
affecting poor and vulnerable communities in many developing countries, including
Indonesia. During the period of 2010-2017, there have been approximately 2.2
million confirmed malaria cases reported across Indonesia. This study aimed to
identify individual, household and village-level factors associated with
self-reported malaria among adults more than 15 years of age in Maluku, West
Papua and Papua province.
METHODS: This study analysed a subset of the data from nationally representative 
population-based Indonesian National Basic Health Research (Riset Kesehatan
Dasar) (N = 1,027,763 in 294,959 households in 33 provinces) in 2013. Total of
41,079 individuals (20,326 males and 20,753 females) aged ≥ 15 years in 19,269
households in Maluku, West Papua and Papua provinces were included. Participants 
were interviewed if they ever had been diagnosed and laboratory confirmed of
having malaria by physician in the past 12 months. A mixed effects multilevel
logistic regression models were developed to assess the associations between
socio-demographical variables at individual, household and village level and
self-reported malaria.
RESULTS: Individuals aged ≥ 15 years in 701 villages in Maluku (n = 11,919), West
Papua (n = 8003) and Papua (n = 21,157) were analysed. In all provinces, gender
distribution was equally-represented. The prevalence of self-reported malaria was
4.1% (Maluku), 12.4% (West Papua) and 18.8% (Papua). At the individual level,
primary industry workers (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.15-1.46 [Maluku]; OR 1.17, 95% CI
1.09-1.25 [Papua]) and having higher education were associated with
self-reporting malaria (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.53-0.83 [Maluku]; OR 1.27, 95% CI
1.15-1.40 [Papua]). Household level factors include having bed net and better off
wealth index were associated with increased self-reporting malaria among West
Papua (OR 1.21; 95% CI 1.09-1.34 and OR 1.38; 95% CI 1.17-1.65, respectively) and
Papuan (OR 1.12; 95% CI 1.02-1.23 and OR 1.33; 95% CI 1.11-1.57, respectively)
adults. Increased odds of self-reporting malaria was associated with time
required to reach healthcare facility (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.01-1.67 [Maluku]).
Contextual village-level characteristics such as living in rural (OR 1.31, 95% CI
1.12-1.54 [Maluku]; OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.17-2.07 [West Papua]), higher community
education level (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.02-1.63 [West Papua]; OR 1.45, 95% CI
1.23-1.72 [Papua]), higher community bed net ownerships (OR 0.59 95% CI 0.45-0.77
[West Papua]) were associated with self-reported malaria.
CONCLUSIONS: Factors associated with self-reported malaria were varied between
provinces suggesting locally-specific determinants were exist at individual,
household and community-level. This study highlights the need for specific
interventions by taking into consideration the contextual factors within the
region and involving multi-sectoral collaboration between health authorities and 
related stakeholders (e.g., bureau of education, bureau of public works and
infrastructure) to improve designs in planning and intervention strategies to
succesfully eliminate malaria in Maluku and Papua.

BACKGROUND: In Mozambique, the prevalence of malaria in children under 5 years of
age is among the highest in the world, but limited data exist on determinants of 
care-seeking behaviour for malaria. This study aimed at determining the trends
and factors associated with care-seeking behaviour for fever among children under
5 years of age and to assess the treatment practices for malaria.
METHODS: Secondary data analysis of two cross-sectional studies. Descriptive
statistics were used to summarize socio-economic and demographic characteristics 
of participants, using data from the 2011 Demographic and Health Survey and 2015 
Indicators of Immunization, Malaria and HIV/AIDS Survey. Complex sampling
logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with
care-seeking behaviour, with estimated adjusted odds ratio and respective 95%
confidence intervals, only for 2015 IMASIDA data.
RESULTS: A total of 10,452 and 5168 children under 5 years of age were enrolled
in the 2011 DHS and 2015 IMASIDA, respectively. Care-seeking for fever in public 
and private sectors remained stable during this period (62.6%; 835/1432 in 2011
and 63.7%; 974/1529 in 2015). The main place where care was sought in both
surveys was public hospitals (86.2%; 773/897 in 2011 and 86.7%; 844/974 in 2015).
Prescription of anti-malarial drugs increased from 42.9% (385/897) in 2011 to
53.8% (524/974) in 2015. Artemether-lumefantrine was the most used anti-malarial 
drug for febrile children in both surveys and its use increased from 59.0%
(219/373) in 2011 to 89.3% (457/512) in 2015. Data from 2015 elucidated that
care-seeking was more common in children whose mothers had a secondary level of
education (AOR = 2.27 [95% CI 1.15-4.49]) and among those in poorer quintile
(AOR = 1.46 [95% CI 0.83-1.90]). Mothers with higher education level (AOR = 0.16 
[95% CI 0.34-0.78]) were less likely to seek out care. People from Manica
(AOR = 2.49 [1.03-6.01]), Sofala ([AOR = 2.91 [1.03-8.24]), Inhambane (AOR = 3.95
[1.25-12.45]), Gaza (AOR = 3.25 [1.22-8.65]) and Maputo Province (AOR = 2.65
[1.10-6.41]) were more likely to seek care than people from Maputo City.
CONCLUSION: Data from this study showed that care-seeking in Mozambique remained 
suboptimal. Interventions to raise the awareness for early care-seeking during
episodes of fever should be urgently reinforced and intensified.

Objectives: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) was believed to have minimal impact on
pregnancy outcomes apart from the risk of perinatal transmission. In more recent 
years, there have been reports of adverse associations, most consistently preterm
birth (PTB), but this is in the context of high rates of caesarean section. The
aim of this study was to explore the association of HBV on pregnancy outcomes in 
marginalized, low-income populations on the Myanmar-Thailand border.
Methods: HBsAg positive (+) point of care rapid detection tests results were
confirmed by immunoassays. Women with a confirmed HBsAg status, HIV- and
syphilis-negative at first antenatal care screening, singleton fetus and known
pregnancy outcome (Aug-2012 to Dec-2016) were included. Logistic regression
analysis was used to evaluate associations between HBV group (controls HBsAg
negative, HBsAg+/HBeAg-, or HBsAg+/HBeAg+) and pregnancy outcome and comorbidity.
Results: Most women were tested, 15,046/15,114 (99.6%) for HBV. The inclusion
criteria were not met for 4,089/15,046 (27.2%) women due mainly to unavailability
of pregnancy outcome and nonconfirmation of HBsAg+. In evaluable women 687/11,025
(6.2%) were HBsAg+, with 476/11,025 (4.3%) HBsAg+/HBeAg- and 211/11,025 (1.9%)
were HBsAg+/HBeAg+. The caesarean section rate was low at 522/8,963 (5.8%). No
significant associations were observed between pregnancy comorbidities or adverse
pregnancy outcomes and HBV status.
Conclusions: The results highlight the disease burden of HBV in women on the
Myanmar-Thailand border and support original reports of a lack of significant
associations with HBsAg+ irrespective of HBeAg status, for comorbidity, and
pregnancy outcomes in deliveries supervised by skilled birth attendants.

Introduction: Malaria is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide,
requiring individual and environmental level controls to prevent its adverse
morbidity effects. This study examined reproductive-aged women's knowledge and
care-seeking practices for malaria prevention and control in Ghana.
Methods: The 2016 Ghana Malaria Indicator Survey data for reproductive-age women 
was analysed (n=5,150). Multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression model was
used to determine factors associated with reproductive-aged women's knowledge and
care-seeking practices for malaria.
Results: 62.3%, 81.3%, and 64.6% knowledge levels on causes, signs/symptoms, and 
prevention of malaria were found, respectively, among respondents. Age, wealth
and educational status, religion, region, and place of residence (rural) were
found to significantly influence respondents' knowledge of causes,
signs/symptoms, and care-seeking practices for malaria. A 15% differential among 
Insecticide Treated Nets (ITNs) awareness and use was found. Increasing age (≥35 
years) was associated with increasing knowledge of malaria. Regional variations
were observed to significantly influence knowledge of malaria treatment.
Conclusion: Though ownership of ITNs and knowledge of malaria prevention were
high, it did not necessarily translate into use of ITNs. Thus, there is a need to
intensify education on the importance and the role of ITNs use in the prevention 
of malaria.

Purpose: In 2005, Burkina Faso changed its first-line treatment for uncomplicated
malaria from chloroquine to artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs).
Patient adherence to ACTs regimen is a keystone to achieve the expected
therapeutic outcome and prevent the emergence and spread of parasite resistance. 
Eleven years after the introduction of ACTs in the health system, this study
aimed to measure adherence level of patients in rural settlement and investigate 
the determinants of nonadherence.
Patients and methods: The study was carried out at public peripheral health
facilities from May 2017 to August 2017 in Nanoro health district, Burkina Faso. 
An electronic semi-structured questionnaire was used for data collection from
patients with an ACT prescription at their medical consultation exit visit and
during home visit at day 5±2. Adherence level was measured through self-report
and pill counts. Logistic regression was performed to identify factors for
nonadherence.
Results: The analysis was conducted on 199 outpatients who received ACT as
prescription. About 92.5% of ACT prescriptions included artemether-lumefantrine
tablets. Adherence level was measured in 97.0% of included patients at day 5±2.
Of these, 86.0% were classified as "complete adherent" and 14.0% as
"nonadherent". In univariate analysis, patients/caregivers who considered that
affordability of ACTs was easy seemed to be less adherent to the treatment
regimen (OR: 0.26; 95% CI: 0.07-0.70). In univariate and multivariable analyses, 
patients/caregivers who did not receive advices from health care workers (HCWs)
were more likely to be nonadherent to the prescribed ACTs (adjusted OR: 3.21; 95%
CI: 1.13-9.12).
Conclusion: This study demonstrates that majority of those who get an ACT
prescription comply with the recommended regimen. This emphasizes that in rural
settings where ACTs are provided free of charge or at a subsidized price, patient
adherence to ACTs is high, thus minimizing the risk of subtherapeutic
concentrations of the drug in blood which is known to increase resistance and
susceptibility to new infections. Therefore, to address the problem of patient
nonadherence, strategy to strengthen communication between HCWs and patients
should be given greater consideration.

BACKGROUND: Malaria remains a major challenge in sub-Saharan Africa and Ghana is 
not an exception. Effective malaria transmission control requires evidence-based 
targeting and utilization of resources. Disease risk mapping provides an
effective and efficient tool for monitoring transmission and control efforts. The
aim of this study is to analyse and map malaria risk in children under 5 years
old, with the ultimate goal of identifying areas where control efforts can be
targeted.
METHODS: Data collected from the 2016 Ghana demographic and health survey was
analyzed. Binomial logistic regression was applied to examine the determinants of
malaria risk among children. Model-based geostatistical methods were applied to
analyze, predict and map malaria prevalence.
RESULTS: There is a significant association of malaria prevalence with area of
residence (rural/urban), age, indoor residual spray use, social economic status
and mother's education level. Overall, parasitaemia prevalence among children
under 5 years old for the year 2016 is low albeit characterized by "hotspots" in 
specific areas.
CONCLUSION: The risk maps indicate the spatial heterogeneity of malaria
prevalence. The high resolution maps can serve as an effective tool in the
identification of locations that require targeted interventions by programme
implementers; this is key and relevant for reducing malaria burden in Ghana.

Background: Malaria remains a diagnostic challenge in many endemic communities.
Although rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are presently widely used for malaria
diagnosis, there is a dearth of information on post-marketing surveillance on its
efficacy in Cameroon. The present study evaluated the performance characteristics
of CareStart™ Malaria HRP2 (histidine-rich protein 2) antigen (Ag) RDT in
diagnosing Plasmodium falciparum infection in the Mount Cameroon area and
predictors associated with RDT positivity.
Methods: The CareStart™ Malaria HRP2 Plasmodium falciparum (G0141) Ag RDT was
evaluated in a cross-sectional community-based survey involving 491 children of
both sexes aged 6 months to 14 years between April and May 2018. Malaria
parasitaemia was confirmed by light microscopy. Sensitivity (Se), specificity
(Sp), positive (PPV) and negative (NPV) predictive values of the RDT, and the
corresponding accuracy and Kappa value (κ) were determined using microscopy as
the gold standard. Haemoglobin (Hb) concentration was obtained using an
auto-haematology analyser. Results were compared using the chi-square test and
associations between predictor variables, and RDT results were assessed using
logistic regression analysis.
Results: Microscopically confirmed malaria parasite prevalence was 27.7%, and
geometric mean density was 187 parasites/μL of blood (range 70-1162). Se, Sp,
PPV, NPV and accuracy were 82.4, 76.6, 57.4, 91.9 and 78.2%, respectively.
Sensitivity depended on parasitaemia and reached 96.1% at densities ≥ 200
parasites/μL of blood. The accuracy of malaria parasitaemia (as assessed by the
area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) to predict malaria by RDT
was 75.4% (95% CI 70.6-80.1). The agreement between microscopy and RDT was
moderate (κ = 0.52). RDT positivity was significantly associated with fever
(P < 0.001), children less than 5 years (P = 0.02), history of fever within a
month (P < 0.001) and anaemia (P = 0.002).
Conclusion: The overall concurrence of CareStart™ Malaria HRP2 pf Ag RDT with
microscopy in the detection of P. falciparum infection is moderate and is most
useful at parasitaemia ≥ 200 parasites/μL of blood and presentation with fever.
While RDT is effective as a diagnostic test for confirmation of clinical cases of
malaria, its applications in population screening with a higher proportion of
asymptomatic cases are limited.

BACKGROUND: Tanzania remains among the countries with the highest burden of
infectious diseases (notably HIV, Malaria and Tuberculosis) during pregnancy. In 
response, the country adopted World Health Organization's (WHO) latest antenatal 
care (ANC) guidelines which recommend comprehensive services including diagnostic
screening and treatment for pregnant women during antenatal. However, as Tanzania
makes efforts to scale up these services under the existing health system
resources, it is crucial to understand its capacity to deliver these services in 
an integrated fashion. Using the WHO's service availability and readiness
assessment(SARA) framework, this study assesses the capacity of the Tanzanian
Health System to provide integrated Malaria, Tuberculosis and HIV services.
METHODS: Composite indicators of the five components of integration were
constructed from primary datasets of the Tanzanian Service Provision Assessments 
(SPA) under the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) programs. Chi-squared
analysis, T test and ANOVA were conducted to determine the associations of each
of the defined components and background characteristics of facilities/health
workers. A logistic regression model was further used to explore strength of
relationships between availability of service readiness components and a pregnant
women's receipt of HIV, Malaria and TB services by reporting adjusted odds
ratios.
RESULTS: Generally, capacity to integrate malaria services was significantly
higher (72.3 95% CI 70.3-74.4 p = 0.02) compared to Tuberculosis (48.9 95% CI
48.4-50.7) and HIV (54.8 95% CI 53.1-56.9) services. Diagnostic capacity was
generally higher than treatment commodities. Regarding the components of SARA
integration, logistic regression found that the adjusted odds ratio of having all
five components of integration and receiving integrated care was 1.9 (95% CI
0.8-2.7). Among these components, the strongest determinant (predictor) to
pregnant women's receipt of integrated care was having trained staff on site (AOR
2.6 95% CI 0.6-4.5).
CONCLUSION: Toward a successful integration of these services under the new WHO
guidelines in Tanzania, efforts should be channelled into strengthening
infectious disease care especially HIV and TB. Channelling investments into
training of health workers (the strongest determinant to integrated care) is
likely to result in positive outcomes for the pregnant woman and unborn child.

Prevalence of and risk factors associated with polymerase chain reaction
(PCR)-determined Plasmodium falciparum positivity were assessed on day 3 after
initiation of treatment, pre-implementation and up to 8 years post-deployment of 
artemether-lumefantrine as first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria in
Bagamoyo district, Tanzania. Samples originated from previously reported trials
conducted between 2006 and 2014. Cytochrome b-nested PCR was used to detect
malaria parasites from blood samples collected on a filter paper on day 3.
Chi-square and McNemar chi-squared tests, logistic regression models, and
analysis of variance were used as appropriate. Primary outcome was based on the
proportion of patients with day 3 PCR-determined P. falciparum positivity.
Overall, 256/584 (43.8%) of screened patients had day 3 PCR-determined
positivity, whereas only 2/584 (0.3%) had microscopy-determined asexual
parasitemia. Day 3 PCR-determined positivity increased from 28.0% (14/50) in 2006
to 74.2% (132/178) in 2007-2008 and declined, thereafter, to 36.0% (50/139) in
2012-2013 and 27.6% (60/217) in 2014. When data were pooled, pretreatment
microscopy-determined asexual parasitemia ≥ 100,000/µL, hemoglobin < 10 g/dL, age
< 5 years, temperature ≥ 37.5°C, and year of study 2007-2008 and 2012-2013 were
significantly associated with PCR-determined positivity on day 3. Significant
increases in P. falciparum multidrug resistance gene 1 N86 and P. falciparum
chloroquine resistant transporter K76 across years were not associated with
PCR-determined positivity on day 3. No statistically significant association was 
observed between day 3 PCR-determined positivity and PCR-adjusted recrudescence. 
Day 3 PCR-determined P. falciparum positivity remained common in patients treated
before and after implementation of artemether-lumefantrine in Bagamoyo district, 
Tanzania. However, its presence was associated with pretreatment characteristics.

BACKGROUND: Malaria is among the top causes of mortality and morbidity in Zambia.
Efforts to control, prevent, and eliminate it have been intensified in the past
two decades which has contributed to reductions in malaria prevalence and
under-five mortality. However, there was a 21% upsurge in malaria prevalence
between 2010 and 2015. Zambia is one of the only 13 countries to record an
increase in malaria among 91 countries monitored by the World Health Organization
in 2015. This study investigated the upsurge by decomposition of drivers of
malaria.
METHODS: The study used secondary data from three waves of nationally
representative cross-sectional surveys on key malaria indicators conducted in
2010, 2012 and 2015. Using multivariable logistic regression, determinants of
malaria prevalence were identified and then marginal effects of each determinant 
were derived. The marginal effects were then combined with changes in coverage
rates of determinants between 2010 and 2015 to obtain the magnitude of how much
each variable contributed to the change in the malaria prevalence.
RESULTS: The odds ratio of malaria for those who slept under an
insecticide-treated net (ITN) was 0.90 (95% CI 0.77-0.97), indoor residual
spraying (IRS) was 0.66 (95% CI 0.49-0.89), urban residence was 0.23 (95% CI
0.15-0.37), standard house was 0.40 (95% CI 0.35-0.71) and age group 12-59 Months
against those below 12 months was 4.04 (95% CI 2.80-5.81). Decomposition of
prevalence changes by determinants showed that IRS reduced malaria prevalence by 
- 0.3% and ITNs by - 0.2% however, these reductions were overridden by increases 
in prevalence due to increases in the proportion of more at-risk children aged
12-59 months by + 2.3% and rural residents by + 2.2%.
CONCLUSION: The increases in interventions, such as ITNs and IRS, were shown to
have contributed to malaria reduction in 2015; however, changes in demographics
such as increases in the proportion of more at risk groups among under-five
children and rural residents may have overridden the impact of these
interventions and resulted in an overall increase. The upsurge in malaria in 2015
compared to 2010 may not have been due to weaknesses in programme interventions
but due to increases in more at-risk children and rural residents compared to
2010. The apparent increase in rural residents in the sample population may not
have been a true reflection of the population structure but due to oversampling
in rural areas which was not fully adjusted for. The increase in malaria
prevalence may therefore have been overestimated.

OBJECTIVES: Northern Tanzania experiences significant malaria-related morbidity
and mortality, but accurate data are scarce. We update the data on patterns of
low-grade Plasmodium falciparum malaria infection among children in northern
Tanzania.
METHODS: Plasmodium falciparum malaria prevalence (pfPR) was assessed in a
representative sample of 819 children enrolled in 94 villages in northern
Tanzania between October 2015 and August 2016, using a complex survey design.
Individual- and household-level risk factors for pfPR were elicited using
structured questionnaires. pfPR was assessed using rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) 
and thick film microscopy (TFM). Associations with pfPR, based on RDT, were
assessed using adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and confidence intervals (CI) from
weighted survey logistic regression models.
RESULTS: Plasmodium falciparum malaria prevalence (pfPR) was 39.5% (95% CI: 31.5,
47.5) by RDT and 33.4% (26.0, 40.6) by TFM. pfPR by RDT was inversely associated 
with higher-education parents, especially mothers (5-7 years of education: aOR
0.55; 95% CI: 0.31, 0.96, senior secondary education: aOR 0.10; 95% CI: 0.02,
0.55), living in a house near the main road (aOR 0.34; 95% CI: 0.15, 0.76), in a 
larger household (two rooms: aOR 0.40; 95% CI: 0.21, 0.79, more than two rooms OR
0.35; 95% CI: 0.20, 0.62). Keeping a dog near or inside the house was positively 
associated with pfPR (aOR 2.01; 95% CI: 1.26, 3.21). pfPR was not associated with
bed-net use or indoor residual spraying.
CONCLUSIONS: Nearly 40% of children in northern Tanzania had low-grade malaria
antigenaemia. Higher parental education and household metrics but not mosquito
bed-net use were inversely associated with pfPR.

We aimed to determine risk factors for developing severe illness in patients
infected with imported Plasmodium falciparum, and identify factors that can be
implemented in preventive public health actions. Data of patients in Anhui
province were collected from the China Information System for Disease Control and
Prevention and Information System for Parasitic Disease Control and Prevention
from 2012-2018. Epidemiological characteristics, clinical severity, and
preventive measures were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Risk factors for 
severe malaria were identified by logistic regression. During the study period,
8.01% (53/662) of patients infected with P. falciparum developed severe malaria; 
the annual severe incidence rate varied from 5.93% to 10.77% and the fatality
rate was 0.6%. Two models were built to analyze the delay from symptom onset to
treatment; one analyzed data by stage, whereas the other analyzed data combined
from all stages. In model 1, multivariate analysis identified misdiagnosis at
first medical visit and patient delay as risk factors for severe malaria (odds
ratio: 3.108 and 3.385, respectively, all p < 0.01). In model 2, overall delay
was a significant factor of severe malaria onset (odds ratio: 4.719, p = 0.000). 
In both models, patients with a history of previous infection had a signiﬁcantly 
reduced risk of developing severe malaria; high parasitemia (≥ 2.5%) was
associated with an increased risk of severe infection. Delay between symptom
onset and treatment was an important cause for development of severe disease in
Anhui province. Measures to reduce delays should be used and implemented in
preventive public health actions.

BACKGROUND: Improving access to early diagnosis and treatment (EDT) has
increasingly proven to be a major contributor to decreasing malaria incidence in 
low-transmission settings. The Malaria Elimination Task Force (METF) has deployed
malaria posts set up in Eastern Myanmar, providing free uninterrupted
community-based access to EDT in more than 1200 villages. Ensuring high quality
services are provided by these malaria posts is essential to reaching elimination
targets. The present study aimed to determine the functionality of the malaria
posts in the METF programme.
METHODS: This report analysed routinely collected data (weekly reports,
individual consultation, diagnostic test quality control) and data collected
specifically during monitoring and evaluation visits using descriptive statistics
and univariate logistic regression. The presence of major dysfunctions
(stock-outs and reported closing; likely to impair the ability of the population 
to access EDT) or minor dysfunctions (no formal METF training, lack of regular
salary, forms and manual not on-site, and low frequency of supervisor visits) and
the ability to anticipate dysfunctions through analysis of weekly reports were
assessed.
RESULTS: A total of 65% of malaria posts had no major dysfunction identified
during monitoring and evaluation visits, while 86% of malaria posts were fully
stocked with tests and medicines used for treatment. Diagnosis was correctly
conducted with few false positives and rare mis-speciation of results. Malaria
post worker knowledge of malaria treatments showed few gaps, mostly in the
treatment of more complex presentations. Malaria posts were well utilized in the 
population, with 94% of consultations occurring within the first 3 days of fever.
In the regression analysis, reported stock-outs and delayed weekly reports were
associated with observed major and minor dysfunctions in monitoring and
evaluation visits, emphasizing the need to reinforce support to malaria post
supervisors, who were responsible for the local logistics of supply and data
transmission and day-to-day supervision.
CONCLUSION: The malaria posts operating under the METF programme perform to a
high standard, with the majority offering uninterrupted access to diagnosis and
treatment, and high service uptake in the villages serviced by the programme.
However, programme operations can be strengthened by increasing malaria post
supervisor visits and re-training malaria post workers.

We aimed to identify clinical and laboratory predictors of mortality in children 
from a malaria-endemic area of Papua New Guinea hospitalized for severe illness. 
Children aged 0.5-10 years presenting with any WHO-defined feature of severe
malarial illness were eligible for recruitment. Each child was assessed with a
detailed clinical examination, blood film microscopy, malaria rapid diagnostic
testing (RDT), a full blood examination, and blood glucose and lactate
concentrations. Clinical care was coordinated by local medical staff in
accordance with national guidelines. Daily study assessments were conducted until
death or discharge. Other biochemical tests and malaria polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) tests were performed subsequently. Logistic regression identified
independent predictors of death. Of 787 evaluable children with severe illness,
336 had confirmed severe malaria (microscopy and PCR positive) and 58 (6.6%) died
during hospitalization. The independent predictors of mortality were
hyperlactatemia (adjusted odds ratio [95% CI]: 2.85 [1.24-6.41], P = 0.01),
malnutrition (2.92 [1.36-6.23], P = 0.005), renal impairment (3.85 [1.53-9.24], P
= 0.002), plasma albumin (0.93 [0.88-0.98] for a 1 g/L increase, P = 0.004), and 
Blantyre coma score (BCS) ≤ 2 (10.3 [4.77-23.0] versus a normal BCS, P < 0.0001).
Confirmed severe malaria (0.11 [0.03-0.30] versus non-malarial severe illness, P 
< 0.0001) was independently associated with lower mortality. Although established
risk factors were evident, malaria was inversely associated with mortality. This 
highlights the importance of accurate diagnosis through blood film microscopy,
RDTs, and, if available, PCR to both guide management and provide valid
epidemiological data.

BACKGROUND: Due to their close relationship with the environment, Alaskans are at
risk for zoonotic pathogen infection. One way to assess a population's disease
burden is to determine the seroprevalence of pathogens of interest. The objective
of this study was to determine the seroprevalence of 11 zoonotic pathogens in
people living in Alaska.
METHODS: In a 2007 avian influenza exposure study, we recruited persons with
varying wild bird exposures. Using sera from this study, we tested for antibodies
to Cryptosporidium spp., Echinococcus spp., Giardia intestinalis, Toxoplasma
gondii, Trichinella spp., Brucella spp., Coxiella burnetii, Francisella
tularensis, California serogroup bunyaviruses, and hepatitis E virus (HEV).
RESULTS: Eight hundred eighty-seven persons had sera tested, including 454
subsistence bird hunters and family members, 160 sport bird hunters, 77 avian
wildlife biologists, and 196 persons with no wild bird exposure. A subset
(n = 481) of sera was tested for California serogroup bunyaviruses. We detected
antibodies to 10/11 pathogens. Seropositivity to Cryptosporidium spp. (29%),
California serotype bunyaviruses (27%), and G. intestinalis (19%) was the most
common; 63% (301/481) of sera had antibodies to at least one pathogen. Using a
multivariable logistic regression model, Cryptosporidium spp. seropositivity was 
higher in females (35.7% vs. 25.0%; p = 0.01) and G. intestinalis seropositivity 
was higher in males (21.8% vs. 15.5%; p = 0.02). Alaska Native persons were more 
likely than non-Native persons to be seropositive to C. burnetii (11.7% vs. 3.8%;
p = 0.005) and less likely to be seropositive to HEV (0.4% vs. 4.1%; p = 0.01).
Seropositivity to Cryptosporidium spp., C. burnetii, HEV, and Echinococcus
granulosus was associated with increasing age (p ≤ 0.01 for all) as was
seropositivity to ≥1 pathogen (p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Seropositivity to zoonotic pathogens is common among Alaskans with
the highest to Cryptosporidium spp., California serogroup bunyaviruses, and G.
intestinalis. This study provides a baseline for use in assessing seroprevalence 
changes over time.

BACKGROUND: Despite malaria control programmes having successfully increased the 
number of households owning insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) in Malawi, the
population of people with ITN access but still not using them fluctuated from 13%
in 2010, 5% in 2012 and then 12% in 2015. This study aimed to compare the rate
and factors associated with ITN usage among children under 5 years of age, living
in household with at least one ITN, in Malawi between 2010 and 2015.
METHODS: The 2010 and 2015-2016 Malawi Demographic and Health Surveys (MDHSs)
were utilized. Only children from households that owned at least one ITN were
selected. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to examine
associations of child, maternal and household factors with ITN usage.
RESULTS: In total, 12,378 and 10,196 children under 5 years of age were examined 
from 2010 and 2015-2016, respectively. ITN usage increased from 57.8% (95%
Confidence interval (CI): 56.1%-59.4%) in 2010 to 69.0% (95% CI 67.4%-70.5%) in
2015. The multivariate analysis revealed that, among others, being
aged ≥ 24 months, having mothers with no formal education or with primary
education, residing in a female-headed household, and residing in households that
had poor household ITN supply were significantly associated with reduced odds of 
ITN usage.
CONCLUSIONS: ITNs are a key vector control intervention in malaria prevention.
This study revealed increased ITN usage among children under 5 years old in the
5-year period, suggesting that considerable improvements have been made. However,
continued efforts to increase awareness of the importance of using ITNs in
malaria prevention in Malawi are necessary. Findings from this research provide
some policy implications, especially for improving household ITN supply, to
improve ITN utilization in Malawi.

BACKGROUND: To control and eventually eliminate vivax malaria, radical treatment 
with primaquine (PQ) is essential after completion of blood-stage treatment.
Although in many malaria-endemic countries, village health volunteers (VHVs) are 
engaged in diagnostic treatment of malaria in remote communities, they
principally provide blood-stage treatment. In such a situation, access to PQ
following blood-stage treatment can be a barrier to complete treatment. However, 
studies on access to PQ treatment have been scarce and limited in health
facility-based settings. This study aimed to identify factors associated with
access to PQ treatment in rural Papua New Guinea (PNG) from the community case
management perspective.
METHODS: A community-based, cross-sectional survey was conducted to collect
sociodemographic information on children under 15 years of age, their households,
and their caretakers in East Sepik Province, PNG. Data collection lasted from
February to March, 2015. Information on the diagnoses of potential non-falciparum
malaria and prescription of PQ in preceding year (January to December 2014) were 
obtained from child health-record books. Then, multilevel logistic regression
model was used to determine the factors associated with formal health facility
visits for PQ treatment among children with potential non-falciparum malaria.
RESULTS: Of 420 episodes diagnosed as potential non-falciparum malaria, 46 (11%) 
were immediately given PQ. The rest were instructed to visit formal health
facilities (HFs) for PQ, and the patients obtained PQ during the second visit to 
HFs was 44%. Consequently, the overall proportion of PQ prescription was 50%.
Logistic regression analysis suggested that among the patients who were
instructed to visit HFs for PQ treatment, the initial visit to VHV and higher
transportation costs to HF were inversely associated with PQ prescription during 
the second visit to an HF.
CONCLUSIONS: Few children received PQ treatment during the second visit to HFs
following diagnosis of potential non-falciparum malaria. These findings suggest a
need to establish a policy to reduce structural and economic barriers and improve
rural inhabitant access to PQ treatment.

BACKGROUND: Anemia in children continues to be a major public health challenge in
developing countries and particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. Anemia has serious
consequences on the growth and development of the children in the early stages of
life. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and associated factors of
anemia among children from 6 to 59 months in Togo.
METHODS: Data from the Togo Demographic and Health Survey 2013-2014 were used for
this study. This nationally representative survey provided data on a wide range
of indicators such as mother and child health, nutrition and other
characteristics. Anemia status was determined using hemoglobin level (Hb
< 11.0 g/dl), and the weighted prevalence of childhood anemia along with 95%
confidence intervals were provided. Data were analyzed using logistic regression 
models to estimate odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI)
for associated factors.
RESULTS: Two thousand eight hundred ninety children aged 6-59 months were
included in this analysis. The weighted prevalence of anemia was 70.9% [95%
CI = 68.8-73.1] with 2.6% [95% CI = 2.0-3.3] of severe anemia among these
children. In the multivariate analysis, the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for anemia 
was 0.33 [95% CI = 0.26-0.42] in children aged from 24 to 42 months and 0.22 [95%
CI = 0.17-0.29] in children aged from 43 to 59 months. Children's malaria status 
was strongly associated to childhood anemia with an aOR of 3.03 [95%
CI = 2.49-3.68]. The secondary level of education and more for the mother was
associated to childhood anemia with an aOR of 0.67 [95% CI = 0.52-0.86]. The aOR 
for children whose mother had anemia was 1.62 [95% CI = 1.30-2.02].
CONCLUSION: This study has highlighted the high prevalence of childhood anemia in
Togo and revealed that younger children and maternal anemia were positively
associated to childhood anemia whereas age of children and high level of maternal
education were negatively associated to childhood anemia.

BACKGROUND: Anti-malarial treatments effectiveness remains a critical challenge
for control programmes. However, when drug efficacy is established, the dose is
calculated based on a predefined weight according to the patient age. Based on
the hypothesis that the standard assumption of weight according to the age when
administering the drug could lead to a therapeutic failure potentially due to
under-dosing (in the case of overweight) or over-dosing (in case of underweight).
In this study, the relationship between weight status and malaria drug efficacy
in clearing current Plasmodium falciparum infection and preventing reinfection
after treatment was investigated.
METHODS: Data were drown from a clinical trial conducted previously to
investigate malaria drug efficacy in 749 children from Mali (2002-2004).
Participants were treated either with artesunate + amodiaquine (AS + AQ,
n1 = 250), artesunate + sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (AS + SP, n2 = 248) or
artesunate (AS, n3 = 251) and followed for 28 days after treatment. The World
Health Organization (WHO) z-score was used to define weight status. A Chi square 
test was used to compare outcomes according to drugs, weight status and the
dynamic of ALAT, ASAT, creatinine and haemoglobin level. Logistic regression
models were developed to determine the effect of baseline parameters (weight
status, aspartate transaminase, alanine aminotransferase, creatinine and
haemoglobin level) on drug efficacy as per WHO criteria.
RESULTS: Without molecular correction, in AS + AQ arm, the rate of adequate
clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) was higher in the group of
underweight children 94.74% compared to children with normal and overweight
(91.24% and 80.43% respectively, p = 0.03). After PCR correction, treatment
efficacy was similar in the three groups of patients and was above 98% (p = 0.4).
Overweight was observed to have no impact on recrudescence. However, it was
associated with an increased risk of new infections in the (AS + AQ) arm
(OR = 0.21, 95% CI [0.06; 0.86], p = 0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that weight deficiency has no deleterious
effect on anti-malarial drug efficacy. An increase in the rate of reinfection in 
overweight children treated by AS + AQ should be further explored in larger
studies.

Malaria infection during pregnancy is a major public health problem in
sub-Saharan Africa. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that
gestational and congenital malaria can be prevented by using intermittent
preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine
(IPTp-SP). IPTp-SP is a full therapeutic course of antimalarial medicine
administered during pregnancy as a component of antenatal care. This study's
objective was to assess the prevalence and predictors of IPTp-SP uptake in
pregnancy in Sierra Leone. This study was based on the fifth round of the
Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS 5) conducted in Sierra Leone in 2016.
Participants were 8526 women aged between 15⁻49 years. Outcome variables were
uptake of IPTp-SP during the last pregnancy. Data were analysed using
cross-tabulation and logistic regression methods. Results showed that the
prevalence of taking IPTp-SP was 94.81% (92.40, 96.14), and that the prevalence
of taking at least three doses was 93.24% (92.50, 94.81). In the multivariate
logistic regression, education, parity, and antenatal care (ANC) use were
significant predictors of IPTp-SP uptake. Women with higher education had lower
odds of taking IPTp-SP (Odds Ratio = 0.647, 95%CI = 0.444, 0.943); having higher 
parity (>4) was associated with lower odds of taking IPTp-SP (OR = 0.663; 95%CI =
0.442, 0.994) and adequate ANC use increased the odds of taking IPTp-SP in both
urban (OR = 1.450, 95%CI = 1.158, 3.128) and rural areas (OR = 1.903, 95%CI =
1.069, 1.966). In contrast, the positive association between ANC visits and
adequate doses of taking IPTp-SP was true for rural women only (OR = 1.408, 95%CI
= 1.174, 1.689). In conclusion, the use of IPTp-SP is close to being universal,
with the prevalence being relatively higher in the rural areas. Based on our
findings, promoting adequate antenatal care visits should be regarded as a key
strategy to improve the use of IPTp-SP in Sierra Leone. Further studies could
focus on exploring other predictors of IPTp-SP uptake that are not captured by
MICS in Sierra Leone.

BACKGROUND: High prevalence of malaria and hepatitis B has been reported among
pregnant women in Ghana. In endemic areas, the diagnoses of malaria and hepatitis
B among pregnant women on antenatal visits are done using histidine-rich protein 
2 (HRP2) and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs),
respectively, which are, however, reported to give some false positive results.
Also, socio-economic determinants have been drawn from these RDTs results which
may have questionable implications. Thus, this study was aimed at evaluating the 
prevalence of malaria and hepatitis B by comparing RDTs with polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) outcomes, and relating the PCR prevalence with socio-economic
status among pregnant women in Northern Ghana.
METHODS: We screened 2071 pregnant women on their first antenatal visit for
Plasmodium falciparum and hepatitis B virus (HBV) using HRP2 and HBsAg RDTs, and 
confirming the infections with PCR. Socio-economic and obstetric information were
collected using a pre-tested questionnaire, and associations with the infections 
were determined using Pearson's chi-square and multinomial logistic regression
analyses at a significance level of p<0.05.
RESULTS: The prevalence of the infections by RDTs/PCR was: 14.1%/13.4% for P.
falciparum mono-infection, 7.9%/7.5% for HBV mono-infection, and 1.9%/1.7% for P.
falciparum/HBV co-infection. No statistical difference in prevalence rates were
observed between the RDTs and PCRs (χ2  =  0.119, p = 0.73 for malaria and χ2  = 
 0.139, p = 0.709 for hepatitis B). Compared with PCRs, the
sensitivity/specificity of the RDTs was 97.5%/99.1% and 97.9%/99.4% for HRP2 and 
HBsAg respectively. Socio-economic status was observed not to influence HBV
mono-infection among the pregnant women (educational status: AOR = 0.78, 95% CI =
0.52-1.16, p = 0.222; economic status: AOR = 1.07, 95% CI = 0.72-1.56, p = 0.739;
financial status: AOR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.44-1.00, p = 0.052). However, pregnant
women with formal education were at a lower risk for P. falciparum mono-infection
(AOR = 0.48, 95% CI  =  0.32-0.71, p<0.001) and P. falciparum/HBV co-infection
(AOR = 0.27, 95% CI  =  0.11-0.67, p = 0.005). Also those with good financial
status were also at a lower risk for P. falciparum mono-infection (AOR = 0.52,
95% CI  =  0.36-0.74, p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: Our data has shown that, the RDTs are comparable to PCR and can give 
a representative picture of the prevalence of malaria and hepatitis B in endemic 
countries. Also, our results support the facts that improving socio-economic
status is paramount in eliminating malaria in endemic settings. However,
socio-economic status did not influence the prevalence of HBV mono-infection
among pregnant women in Northern Ghana.

BACKGROUND: In resource limited settings, there is variability in the level of
adherence to clinical guidelines in the inpatient management of children with
common conditions like severe anemia. However, there is limited data on the
effect of adherence to clinical guidelines on inpatient mortality in children
managed for severe anemia.
METHODS: We analyzed data from an uncontrolled before and after in-service
training intervention to improve quality of care in Lira and Jinja regional
referral hospitals in Uganda. Inpatient records of children aged 0 to 5 years
managed as cases of 'severe anemia (SA)' were reviewed to ascertain adherence to 
clinical guidelines and compare inpatient deaths in SA children managed versus
those not managed according to clinical guidelines. Logistic regression analysis 
was conducted to evaluate the relationship between clinical care factors and
inpatient deaths amongst patients managed for SA.
RESULTS: A total of 1,131 children were assigned a clinical diagnosis of 'severe 
anemia' in the two hospitals. There was improvement in the level of care after
the in-service training intervention with more children being managed according
to clinical guidelines compared to the period before, 218/510 (42.7%) vs 158/621 
(25.4%) (p < 0.001). Overall, children managed according to clinical guidelines
had reduced risk of inpatient mortality compared to those not managed according
to clinical guidelines, [OR 0.28, (95%, CI 0.14, 0.55), p = 0.001]. Clinical care
factors associated with decreased risk of inpatient death included, having
pre-transfusion hemoglobin done to confirm diagnosis [OR 0.5; 95% CI 0.29, 0.87],
a co-morbid diagnosis of severe malaria [OR 0.4; 95% CI 0.25, 0.76], and being
reviewed after admission by a clinician [OR 0.3; 95% CI 0.18, 0.59], while a
co-morbid diagnosis of severe acute malnutrition was associated with increased
risk of inpatient death [OR 4.2; 95% CI 2.15, 8.22].
CONCLUSION: Children with suspected SA who are managed according to clinical
guidelines have lower in-hospital mortality than those not managed according to
the guidelines. Efforts to reduce inpatient mortality in SA children in
resource-limited settings should focus on training and supporting health workers 
to adhere to clinical guidelines.

BACKGROUND: In resource-poor settings, transfused children often experience
recurrence of severe anemia (SA) following discharge from hospital. This study
determined the factors associated with recurrent severe anemia (RSA) among
previously transfused Ugandan children aged less than 5 years.
METHODS: A case-control study was conducted in five hospitals in Uganda from
March 2017 to September 2018. We prospectively enrolled 196 hospitalised children
who had been transfused for severe anemia 2 weeks to 6 months prior to
enrollment. Of these, 101 children (cases) were re-admitted with a hemoglobin
[Hb] level of ≤6 g/dL and required transfusion; and 95 children (age-matched
controls) were admitted for other clinical illness with a Hb > 6 g/dL. Children
known to have sickle cell anemia, cancer, or bleeding disorders were excluded.
Clinical and laboratory evaluation were done. Conditional logistic regression
adjusted for age, was used to determine factors associated with RSA.
RESULTS: The median time (IQR) between the earlier transfusion and enrollment was
3.5 (1.9-5.7) months for cases, and was 5.0 (2.9-6.0) months for controls
(p-value = 0.015). Risk factors (adjusted odds ratio, 95% confidence interval,
and significance) for development of RSA were: hemoglobinuria (36.33,
2.19-600.66, p = 0.012); sickle cell anemia - newly diagnosed (20.26,
2.33-176.37, p = 0.006); history of earlier previous transfusions (6.95,
1.36-35.61, p = 0.020) and malaria infection (6.47, 1.17-35.70, p = 0.032).
CONCLUSION: Malaria chemoprevention, follow up visit for Hb check after discharge
from hospital and sickle cell screening among previously transfused children
represent practical strategies to prevent and identify children at risk for
recurrent severe anemia. The cause of hemoglobinuria in children merits further
investigations.

BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum infection during pregnancy is a major cause of 
poor maternal health, adverse foetal outcome and infant mortality in sub-Saharan 
Africa. Genetic disposition is involved in susceptibility to malaria in pregnancy
and its manifestation. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) influence gene regulation including
that of innate immune responses. A miRNA-146a rs2910164 G > C single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) has been associated with increased risks of several diseases, 
but no data as to malaria are available.
METHODS: The association between miRNA-146a rs2910164 and P. falciparum infection
among 509 Ghanaian women attending antenatal care (ANC) and 296 delivering
Ghanaian primiparae was investigated. Malaria parasites were diagnosed by
microscopy and PCR. Leukocyte-associated hemozoin in placental samples was
recorded as well. Proportions were compared between groups by Fisher's exact
test, and logistic regression models were used to adjust for possible
confounders.
RESULTS: By PCR, P. falciparum infection was detected in 63% and 67% of ANC
attendees and delivering primiparae, respectively. In both groups, two in three
women were either heterozygous or homozygous for miRNA-146a rs2910164. Among ANC 
attendees, homozygosity conferred increased odds of infection (adjusted odds
ratio (aOR), 2.3; 95% CI, 1.3-4.0), which was pronounced among primigravidae
(aOR, 5.8; 95% CI, 1.6-26) but only marginal in multigravidae. Likewise,
homozygosity for miRNA-146a rs2910164 in primiparae increased the odds of past or
present placental P. falciparum infection almost six-fold (aOR, 5.9; 95% CI,
2.1-18).
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that SNP rs2910164 G > C is associated with
increased odds for P. falciparum infection in first-time pregnant women who are
considered to lack sufficient acquired immune responses against
pregnancy-specific strains of P. falciparum. These findings suggest that
miRNA-146a is involved in protective malarial immunity, and specifically in the
innate component.

INTRODUCTION: Plasmodium spp. and helminths are co-endemic in many parts of the
tropics; hence, co-infection is a common phenomenon. Interactions between
Plasmodium and helminth infections may alter the host's immune response and
susceptibility and thus impact on morbidity. There is little information on the
direction and magnitude of such interactions and results are conflicting. This
study aimed at shedding new light on the potential interactions of Plasmodium and
helminth co-infections on anemia and splenomegaly in different population groups 
in Côte d'Ivoire.
METHODOLOGY: Parasitologic and clinical data were obtained from four
cross-sectional community-based studies and a national school-based survey
conducted between 2011 and 2013 in Côte d'Ivoire. Six scenarios of co-infection
pairs defined as Plasmodium infection or high parasitemia, combined with one of
three common helminth infections (i.e., Schistosoma mansoni, S. haematobium, and 
hookworm) served for analysis. Adjusted logistic regression models were built for
each scenario and interaction measures on additive scale calculated according to 
Rothman et al., while an interaction term in the model served as multiplicative
scale measure.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: All identified significant interactions were of antagonistic 
nature but varied in magnitude and species combination. In study participants
aged 5-18 years from community-based studies, Plasmodium-hookworm co-infection
showed an antagonistic interaction on additive scale on splenomegaly, while
Plasmodium-Schistosoma co-infection scenarios showed protective effects on
multiplicative scale for anemia and splenomegaly in participants aged 5-16 years 
from a school-based study.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: No exacerbation from co-infection with Plasmodium and
helminths was observed, neither in participants aged 5-18 years nor in adults
from the community-based studies. Future studies should unravel underlying
mechanisms of the observed interactions, as this knowledge might help shaping
control efforts against these diseases of poverty.

Background: Prompt and effective treatment of malaria is critical because delays 
increase the risk for serious illness, disability and death.
Objective: To assess determinants of delay in seeking treatment among malaria
patients at Dera district, NorthWest Ethiopia.
Methods: A case control study was conducted from September 01 to October 15,
2014. A total of 318 malaria patients diagnosed using microscopy or rapid
diagnostic test, and who sought treatment in health centers were interviewed.
Multivariable logistic regression was done to identify determinants of delay.
Results: Delay was high when a patient earned less than 25.0 USD [AOR=15.7, 95%
CI: 4.8 - 51.2] and 9.6 times higher if he/she was not a member of community
based health insurance [AOR= 9.6, 95% CI: 4.4 - 21.3]. Respondents who travelled 
for more than 30 minutes to get to a health facility [AOR= 4.4, 95% CI: 1.2 -
15.9] were more likely to be late in seeking treatment for malaria.
Conclusion: Income, community based health insurance, previous history of malaria
infection, decision making and distance were determinants of delay in seeking
treatment for malaria. To reduce the delay, interventions should focus on
outreach malaria services and increase enrollment to community based health
insurance.

Background: Malaria is still a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in many
developing countries including Ethiopia. Its prevalence has been declining among 
Ethiopian adults, especially in Dembia district. However, it is still at the top 
of diseases list at the district. Hence, the study aimed to determine the
prevalence and the factors that contribute to its being the major public health
concern despite different preventive and control measures in place.
Methods: A community based cross-sectional study was conducted from October 11 to
November 16, 2017. The multistage sampling technique was employed to select 832
study participants. A rapid diagnostic test were used to confirm the disease.
Data were entered using Epi info version 7 and was analyzed by Statistical
Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 20. The logistic regression model was
performed to examine the association of factors with malaria parasite.
Results: Out of the 832 adults included in the study, 6.7% (95% Confidence
Interval (CI: 5.2-8.7)) were confirmed to be malaria parasite carriers. The
dominant plasmodium species was Plasmodium falciparum [46 (82%)]. According to
the multivariable logistic regression analysis, male sex (Adjusted Odds Ratio
(AOR = 4.5; 95%CI: 2.1-9.5), adult age 15-19 years (AOR = 4.5; 95%CI: 2.1-9.7),
travel history (AOR = 5; 95%CI: 2.34-12.25), and stagnant water around home
(AOR = 3.7; 95%CI: 1.57-8.87) increased the probability of malaria infectivity,
while Insecticidal Treated Nets (ITN) utilization (AOR = 0.2; 95%CI: 0.09-0.31)
decreased it.
Conclusion: Malaria is still an important public health challenge among adults in
the study area. Male sex, age 15-19 years, travel history, living around stagnant
water, and not using ITN increased the probability of infection. Therefore, the
District Health office and Health extension workers should work to increase ITN
distribution and focus on reducing malaria breading sites through community
participation.

BACKGROUND: Despite the increasing interest in China's development assistance for
health (DAH) in African countries, little is known regarding the distribution and
determinants of China's DAH project allocation among the principle subdivisions
(provinces & states) within African countries.
METHODS: We mapped the distribution of China's DAH projects in 670 principle
subdivisions of 50 African countries during 2006-2015 using web-based
information. The political, demographic, health and socioeconomic indicators of
DAH allocation were analyzed using conditional logistic regression models. The
national capital city and political leader's birth place were selected as the
main political indicators, and health indicators were selected according to
different fields of the DAH projects.
RESULTS: China's DAH projects (mainly China medical teams [CMTs], hospitals and
anti-malaria centers) were mostly allocated to the western and eastern coasts of 
Africa, although CMTs were also dispatched to northern Africa. National capital
cities were significantly associated with the allocation of China's DAH projects 
(P <  0.001). Anti-malaria centers were more likely to be allocated to principle 
subdivisions with larger populations (OR = 1.35), and CMTs were allocated to
subdivisions with high population densities (OR = 79.01). No health-related
indicators were identified to affect project allocation except for the facility
delivery rate and under-five mortality rate, which were associated with hospital 
allocation. We also found an association between CMT allocation and the use of
artemisinin-based combination therapy in children.
CONCLUSIONS: Allocation of China's DAH projects is strongly affected by political
and demographic factors. Implementation of China's new DAH projects should target
health and socio-economic indicators and impact metrics in scaling up tailored
and cost-effective programs in Africa.

BACKGROUND: Endemic Burkitt lymphoma (eBL) is an aggressive childhood B-cell
lymphoma linked to Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) malaria in sub-Saharan Africa. We
investigated antibody reactivity to several human receptor-binding domains of the
Pf erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) that play a key role in malaria
pathogenesis and are targets of acquired immunity to malaria.
METHODS: Serum/plasma IgG antibody reactivity was measured to 22 Pf antigens,
including 18 to PfEMP1 CIDR domains between cases and controls from two
populations (149 eBL cases and 150 controls from Ghana and 194 eBL cases and 600 
controls from Uganda). Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for case-control associations 
were estimated by logistic regression.
FINDINGS: There was stronger reactivity to the severe malaria associated CIDRα1
domains than other CIDR domains both in cases and controls. eBL cases reacted to 
fewer antigens than controls (Ghana: p = 0·001; Uganda: p = 0·03), with
statistically significant lower ORs associated with reactivity to 13+ antigens in
Ghana (aOR 0·39, 95% CI 0·24-0·63; pheterogeneity = 0·00011) and Uganda (aOR
0·60, 95% CI 0.41-0·88; pheterogeneity = 0·008). eBL was inversely associated
with reactivity, coded as quartiles, to group A variant CIDRδ1 (ptrend = 0·035)
in Ghana and group B CD36-binding variants CIDRα2·2 (ptrend = 0·006) and CIDRα2·4
(ptrend = 0·033) in Uganda, and positively associated with reactivity to SERA5 in
Ghana (ptrend = 0·017) and Uganda (ptrend = 0·007) and group A CIDRα1·5 variant
in Uganda only (ptrend = 0·034).
INTERPRETATION: eBL cases reacted to fewer antigens than controls using samples
from two populations, Ghana and Uganda. Attenuated humoral immunity to Pf EMP1
may contribute to susceptibility to low-grade malaria and eBL risk.

Introduction: Contrary to World Health Organizations recommendations, health
workers (HWs) still prescribe antimalarials to malaria rapid diagnostic test
(mRDT)-negative patients, thus increasing overuse and the risk of parasite
resistance to the antimalarials. The reasons for this are not clear. We
identified factors associated with antimalarial prescription to mRDT-negative
patients.
Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study among 423 HWs. Data on
socio-demographic characteristics, training, supervision experience and fever
management practices were collected. We tested associations between independent
variables and prescription of antimalarials to mRDT-negative patients using Chi
square and logistic regression at p < 0.05.
Results: The HWs were mostly community health workers (58.6%), with mean age of
41.0 (±8.8) years and 13.6 (± 9.0) years of professional practice. Females were
322 (76.1%) and 368 (87%) were married. Of the 423 HWs interviewed, 329 (77.8%)
received training on mRDT use, 329 (80.6%) received supervision and 129 (30.5%)
had good knowledge of causes of fever. Overall, 110 (26.0%) of the HWs prescribed
antimalarials to mRDT-negative patients. A higher proportion of non-trained vs
trained HWs [Adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) = 4.9; 95% Confidence Interval (CI)
(2.5-8.3)], and HWs having poor knowledge vs HWs having good knowledge of causes 
of fever [aOR = 1.9; 95% CI (1.0-3.5)], prescribed antimalarials to mRDT-negative
patients.
Conclusion: HWs' lack of training on mRDT use and poor knowledge of causes of
fever were associated with prescription of antimalarials to mRDT-negative
patients. We recommend training on management of fever and mRDT use to reduce
such inappropriate antimalarial prescriptions.

BACKGROUND: Anemia is a major public health problem that adversely affects
pregnancy outcomes. The prevalence of anemia among pregnant women before
conception is not well known in Tanzania. The aim of this study was to determine 
the prevalence, types, and risk factors of preconception anemia in women of
reproductive age from a rural Tanzanian setting.
METHODS: Trained field workers visited households to identify all female
residents aged 18-40 years and invited them to the nearby health facility for
screening and enrolment into this study. Baseline samples were collected to
measure hemoglobin levels, serum ferritin, vitamin B12, folate, C-reactive
protein, alanine amino-transferase, the presence of malaria, HIV, and soil
transmitted helminth infections. Anthropometric and socio-economic data were
recorded alongside with clinical information of participants. Logistic regression
analysis was used to determine the adjusted odds ratios (AOR) for the factors
associated with preconception anemia.
FINDINGS: Of 1248 women enrolled before conception, 36.7% (95% confidence
interval (CI) 34.1-39.4) had anemia (hemoglobin <12 g/dL) and 37.6% (95% CI
34.9-40.4) had iron deficiency. For more than half of the anemic cases, iron
deficiency was also diagnosed (58.8%, 95% CI 54.2-63.3). Anemia was independently
associated with increased age (AOR 1.05, 95% CI 1.03-1.07), malaria infection at 
enrolment (AOR 2.21, 95% CI 1.37-3.58), inflammation (AOR 1.77, 95% CI 1.21-2.60)
and iron deficiency (AOR 4.68, 95% CI 3.55-6.17). The odds of anemia were reduced
among women with increased mid-upper arm circumference (AOR 0.90, 95% CI
0.84-0.96).
CONCLUSION: Anemia among women of reproductive age before conception was
prevalent in this rural setting. Increased age, iron deficiency, malaria
infection and inflammation were significant risk factors associated with
preconception anemia, whereas increased mid-upper arm circumference was
protective against anemia. Interventions to ensure adequate iron levels as well
as malaria control before conception are needed to prevent anemia before and
during pregnancy and improve birth outcomes in this setting.

BACKGROUND: Rwanda has dramatically reduced child mortality, but the causes and
sociodemographic drivers for mortality are poorly understood.
METHODS: We conducted a matched case-control study of all children who died
before 5 years of age in eastern Rwanda between 1st March 2013 and 28th February 
2014 to identify causes and risk factors for death. We identified deaths at the
facility level and via a community health worker reporting system. We used verbal
social autopsy to interview caregivers of deceased children and controls matched 
by area and age. We used InterVA4 to determine probable causes of death and
cause-specific mortality fractions, and utilized conditional logistic regression 
to identify clinical, family, and household risk factors for death.
RESULTS: We identified 618 deaths including 174 (28.2%) in neonates and 444
(71.8%) in non-neonates. The most commonly identified causes of death were
pneumonia, birth asphyxia, and meningitis among neonates and malaria, acute
respiratory infections, and HIV/AIDS-related death among non-neonates. Among
neonates, 54 (31.0%) deaths occurred at home and for non-neonates 242 (54.5%)
deaths occurred at home. Factors associated with neonatal death included home
birth (aOR: 2.0; 95% CI: 1.4-2.8), multiple gestation (aOR: 2.1; 95% CI:
1.3-3.5), both parents deceased (aOR: 4.7; 95% CI: 1.5-15.3), mothers non-use of 
family planning (aOR: 0.8; 95% CI: 0.6-1.0), lack of accompanying person (aOR:
1.6; 95% CI: 1.1-2.1), and a caregiver who assessed the medical services they
received as moderate to poor (aOR: 1.5; 95% CI: 1.2-1.9). Factors associated with
non-neonatal deaths included multiple gestation (aOR: 2.8; 95% CI: 1.7-4.8), lack
of adequate vaccinations (aOR: 1.7; 95% CI: 1.2-2.3), household size (aOR: 1.2;
95% CI: 1.0-1.4), maternal education levels (aOR: 1.9; 95% CI: 1.2-3.1), mothers 
non-use of family planning (aOR: 1.6; 95% CI: 1.4-1.8), and lack of household
electricity (aOR: 1.4; 95% CI: 1.0-1.8).
CONCLUSION: In the context of rapidly declining childhood mortality in Rwanda and
increased access to health care, we found a large proportion of remaining deaths 
occur at home, with home deliveries still representing a significant risk factor 
for neonatal death. The major causes of death at a population level remain
largely avoidable communicable diseases. Household characteristics associated
with death included well-established socioeconomic and care-seeking risk factors.

BACKGROUND: Although the incidence of dengue across Africa is high, severe dengue
is reported infrequently. We describe the clinical features and the outcome of
dengue according to raceduring an outbreak in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania that
occurred in both native and expatriate populations.
METHODS: Adults with confirmed dengue (NS1 and/or IgM on rapid diagnostic test
and/or PCR positive) were included between December 2013 and July 2014 in
outpatient clinics. Seven-day outcome was assessed by a visit or a call.
Association between black race and clinical presentation, including warning
signs, was assessed by logistic regression adjusted for age, malaria coinfection,
secondary dengue and duration of symptoms at inclusion. The independent
association between demographic and comorbidities characteristics of the patients
and severe dengue was evaluated by multivariate logistic regression that included
potential confounders.
RESULTS: After exclusion of 3 patients of mixed race, 431 patients with dengue
(serotype 2, genotype Cosmopolitan) were included: 241 of black and 190 of
non-black race. Black patients were younger (median age 30 versus 41 years;
p < 0.001) and attended care after a slightly longer duration of symptoms (median
of 2.9 versus 2.7 days; p = 0.01). Malaria coinfection was not significantly
different between black (5%) and non-black (1.6%) patients (p = 0.06). The same
proportion of patients in both group had secondary dengue (13 and 14%; p = 0.78).
Among warning signs, only mucosal bleed was associated with race, black race
being protective (adjusted OR 0.44; 95% CI 0.21-0.92). Overall, 20 patients
(4.7%) presented with severe dengue. Non-black race (adjusted OR 3.9; 95% CI
1.3-12) and previously known diabetes (adjusted OR 43; 95% CI 5.2-361) were
independently associated with severe dengue.
CONCLUSIONS: Although all patients were infected with the same dengue virus
genotype, black race was independently protective against a severe course of
dengue, suggesting the presence of protective genetic or environmental host
factors among people of African ancestry. The milder clinical presentation of
dengue in black patients might partly explain why dengue outbreaks are
under-reported in Africa and often mistaken for malaria. These results highlight 
the need to introduce point-of-care tests, beside the one for malaria, to detect 
outbreaks and orientate diagnosis.

BACKGROUND: In acute falciparum malaria, asexual parasite reduction ratio two
days post-treatment initiation (PRRD2) ≥ 10 000 per cycle has been used as a
measure of the rapid clearance of parasitaemia and efficacy of artemisinin
derivatives. However, there is little evaluation of alternative measures; for
example, parasite reduction ratio one day after treatment initiation (PRRD1) and 
its relationship with parasite clearance time (PCT) or PRRD2. This study
evaluated the use of PRRD1 as a measure of responsiveness to antimalarial drugs.
METHODS: In acutely malarious children treated with artesunate-amodiaquine (AA), 
artemether-lumefantrine (AL) or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHP), the
relationships between PRRD1 or PRRD2 and PCT, and between PRRD1 and PRRD2 were
evaluated using linear regression. Agreement between estimates of PCT using PRRD1
and PRRD2 linear regression equations was evaluated using the Bland-Altman
analysis. Predictors of PRRD1 > 5000 per half cycle and PRRD2 ≥ 10 000 per cycle 
were evaluated using stepwise multiple logistic regression models. Using the
linear regression equation of the relationship between PRRD1 and PCT previously
generated in half of the DHP-treated children during the early study phase, PCT
estimates were compared in a prospective blinded manner with PCTs determined by
microscopy during the later study phase in the remaining half.
RESULTS: In 919 malarious children, PRRD1 was significantly higher in DHP- and
AA-treated compared with AL-treated children (P <  0.0001). PRRD1 or PRRD2 values
correlated significantly negatively with PCT values (P <  0.0001 for each) and
significantly positively with each other (P <  0.0001). PCT estimates from linear
regression equations for PRRD1 and PRRD2 showed insignificant bias on the
Bland-Altman plot (P = 0.7) indicating the estimates can be used interchangeably.
At presentation, age > 15 months, parasitaemia > 10 000/μl and DHP treatment
independently predicted PRRD1 > 5000 per half cycle, while age > 30 months,
haematocrit ≥31%, body temperature > 37.4 °C, parasitaemia > 100 000/μl, PRRD1
value > 1000 and no gametocytaemia independently predicted PRRD2 ≥ 10 000 per
cycle. Using the linear regression equation generated during the early phase in
166 DHP-treated children, PCT estimates and PCTs determined by microscopy in the 
155 children in the later phase were similar in the same patients.
CONCLUSIONS: PRRD1 and estimates of PCT using PRRD1 linear regression equation of
PRRD1 and PCT can be used in therapeutic efficacy studies.

Background: Anemia is a global public health problem affecting all population
particularly pregnant women. Hence, this study assessed the magnitude of anemia
and associated factors among pregnant.
Methods: Institution based cross-sectional study was conducted among 416 pregnant
women attending antenatal clinic in three public hospitals of Ilu Aba Bora zone. 
The study participants were selected by proportional allocation based on the
number of pregnant women that the respective health facilities contain.
Semistructured questionnaire was used for data collection. Midupper arm
circumference was employed to assess the nutritional status and standard mood
depression assessment tool was used to assess depression. Data were centered and 
analyzed using SPSS version 20.0. Logistic regression analyses were used to see
the association of different variables.
Results: In this study, 31.5% of pregnant women were anemic. In addition, having 
family size five and above [AOR = 2.97, 95% CI (1.69, 5.27)], being rural
resident [AOR=2.74, (95%CI) (2.11, 5.06)], had a higher odds of anemia.
Similarly, having soil transmitted helminthes infection [AOR= 3.19, 95% CI (1.5, 
6.65)] and history of malaria infection in the last one year [AOR= 3.10, 95% CI
(2.10, 5.06)] had also a higher odds anemia during pregnancy. Moreover, being
undernourished [AOR= 2.74 95% CI (1.34, 5.57)] was negatively associated with
magnitude of anemia.
Conclusions: The magnitude of anemia among pregnant women was found to be
significant. Residence, family sizes, history of malaria infection during the
last one year, and undernourishment were significantly associated with anemia
during pregnancy.

Background: International travelers are at high risk of acquiring travelers'
diarrhea. Pre-travel consultation has been associated with lower rates of
malaria, hepatitis, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections. The
objective was to study the impact of pre-travel consultation on clinical
management and outcomes of travelers' diarrhea.
Methods: This retrospective cohort study analyzed 1160 patients diagnosed with
travelers' diarrhea at Mayo Clinic Rochester, MN from 1994 to 2017. Variables
included high-risk activities, post-travel care utilization, antimicrobial
prescriptions, hospitalizations, and complications. Travelers were divided into
those who sought (n = 256) and did not seek (n = 904) pre-travel consultation.
The two groups were compared using the Wilcoxon test for continuous variables and
chi-square test for categorical variables. Multivariate logistic regression was
used to adjust for differences in traveler characteristics.
Results: More pre-travel consultation recipients were young Caucasians who had
more post-travel infectious disease (ID) consultation [OR 3.1 (95% CI 1.9-5.3)], 
more stool sampling [OR 1.6 (95% CI 1.1-2.4)], and more antimicrobial
prescriptions [OR 1.6 (95% CI 1.1-2.5)] for travelers' diarrhea compared to the
non-pre-travel consultation group. The pre-travel consultation group had shorter 
hospital stays (mean 1.8 days for pre-travel versus 3.3 days for non-pre-travel
consultation group, p = 0.006) and reduced gastroenterology consultation rates
[OR 0.4 (95% CI 0.2-0.9)]. 23 patients with positive stool cultures had
Campylobacter susceptibilities performed; 65% (15/23) demonstrated intermediate
susceptibility or resistance to ciprofloxacin.
Conclusion: Pre-travel consultation was associated with higher rates of stool
testing and antimicrobial prescriptions. The high rate of quinolone-resistant
Campylobacter in our small sample suggests the need for judicious antimicrobial
utilization. The pre-travel consultation group did have a shorter duration of
hospitalization and reduced need for gastroenterology consultation for prolonged 
or severe symptoms, which are positive outcomes that reflect reduced morbidity of
travelers' diarrhea.

Prompt and effective treatment is key to malaria control and prevention, as it
reduces disease morbidity and mortality and minimizes the number of transmission 
reservoirs. Transmission reduction may be particularly important among school-age
children (SAC, 5-15 years old), who have the highest prevalence of Plasmodium
falciparum infection in southern Malawi. We hypothesized that one factor
contributing to this difference in prevalence is that SAC are less likely to seek
appropriate treatment for fever than children younger than 5 years. In this
study, we assessed treatment-seeking behaviors of people of all ages between 2012
and 2014 in Malawi. During each of the five cross-sectional surveys, all members 
of ∼900 households reported on fever and treatment-seeking in the previous 2
weeks. Multilevel logistic regression was used to analyze predictors of whether
febrile people sought treatment and whether they did so at formal
(government/private clinics) or informal sources (primarily shops). Twenty-two
percent of participants (3,579/16,621) reported fever, and 2,715 of those (75.9%)
sought treatment. Seeking treatment exclusively from local shops remains a common
practice, although use of recommended diagnostic testing and antimalarial drugs
was infrequently reported there. Although SAC were not significantly less likely 
than children aged < 5 years to seek treatment, SAC and adults (age ≥ 16 years)
were significantly less likely to use formal sources. Our results indicate that
encouraging treatment at government/private clinics and increasing retail access 
to appropriate antimalarial testing and treatment, especially among SAC, could
help remedy inadequate treatment of symptomatic disease and potentially reduce
Plasmodium transmission in Malawi.

BACKGROUND: The effect of malaria in Nigeria is still worrisome and has remained 
a leading public health issue in the country. In 2016, Nigeria was the highest
malaria burden country among the 15 countries in sub-Saharan Africa that
accounted for the 80% global malaria cases. The purpose of this study is to
utilize appropriate statistical models in identifying socio-economic, demographic
and geographic risk factors that have influenced malaria transmission in Nigeria,
based on malaria rapid diagnostic test survey results. This study contributes
towards re-designing intervention strategies to achieve the target of meeting the
Sustainable Development Goals 2030 Agenda for total malaria elimination.
METHODS: This study adopted the generalized linear mixed models approach which
accounts for the complexity of the sample survey design associated with the data.
The 2015 Nigeria malaria indicator survey data of children between 6 and 59
months are used in the study.
RESULTS: From the findings of this study, the cluster effect is significant
[Formula: see text] which has suggested evidence of heterogeneity among the
clusters. It was found that the vulnerability of a child to malaria infection
increases as the child advances in age. Other major significant factors were; the
presence of anaemia in a child, an area where a child resides (urban or rural),
the level of the mother's education, poverty level, number of household members, 
sanitation, age of head of household, availability of electricity and the type of
material for roofing. Moreover, children from Northern and South-West regions
were also found to be at higher risk of malaria disease and re-infection.
CONCLUSION: Improvement of socio-economic development and quality of life is
paramount to achieving malaria free Nigeria. There is a strong link of malaria
risk with poverty, under-development and the mother's educational level.

BACKGROUND: A nationwide, school, malaria survey was implemented to assess the
risk factors of malaria prevalence and bed net use among primary school children 
in mainland Tanzania. This allowed the mapping of malaria prevalence at council
level and assessment of malaria risk factors among school children.
METHODS: A cross-sectional, school, malaria parasitaemia survey was conducted in 
25 regions, 166 councils and 357 schools in three phases: (1) August to September
2014; (2) May 2015; and, (3) October 2015. Children were tested for malaria
parasites using rapid diagnostic tests and were interviewed about household
information, parents' education, bed net indicators as well as recent history of 
fever. Multilevel mixed effects logistic regression models were fitted to
estimate odds ratios of risk factors for malaria infection and for bed net use
while adjusting for school effect.
RESULTS: In total, 49,113 children were interviewed and tested for malaria
infection. The overall prevalence of malaria was 21.6%, ranging from < 0.1 to 53%
among regions and from 0 to 76.4% among councils. The malaria prevalence was
below 5% in 62 of the 166 councils and above 50% in 18 councils and between 5 and
50% in the other councils. The variation of malaria prevalence between schools
was greatest in regions with a high mean prevalence, while the variation was
marked by a few outlying schools in regions with a low mean prevalence. Overall, 
70% of the children reported using mosquito nets, with the highest percentage
observed among educated parents (80.7%), low land areas (82.7%) and those living 
in urban areas (82.2%).
CONCLUSIONS: The observed prevalence among school children showed marked
variation at regional and sub-regional levels across the country. Findings of
this survey are useful for updating the malaria epidemiological profile and for
stratification of malaria transmission by region, council and age groups, which
is essential for guiding resource allocation, evaluation and prioritization of
malaria interventions.

Bed nets averted 68% of malaria cases in Africa between 2000 and 2015. However,
concerns over insecticide resistance, bed net durability and the effectiveness of
long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN) are growing. To assess the effectiveness of
LLINs of different ages and insecticides against malaria, we conducted a
population-based, cross-sectional study using data from 162,963 children younger 
than 5 years of age participating in 33 Demographic and Health and Malaria
Indicator Surveys conducted in 21 countries between 2009 and 2016. We used
Bayesian logistic regression to estimate associations between LLIN age,
insecticide type, and malaria. Children sleeping under LLINs the previous night
experienced 21% lower odds of malaria infection than children who did not (odds
ratio [OR] 0.79; 95% Uncertainty Interval [UI] 0.76-0.82). Nets less than one
year of age exhibited the strongest protective effect (OR 0.75; 95% UI
0.72-0.79), and protection weakened as net age increased. LLINs containing
different insecticides exhibited similar protection (ORdeltamethrin 0.78
[0.75-0.82]; ORpermethrin 0.79 [0.75-0.83]; ORalphacypermethrin 0.85
[0.76-0.94]). Freely-available, population-based surveys can enhance and guide
current entomological monitoring amid concerns of insecticide resistance and bed 
net durability, and be used with locally-collected data to support decisions on
LLIN redistribution campaign timing which insecticide to use.

The burden of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) malaria in Kenya is decreasing; however,
it is still one of the top 10 causes of morbidity, particularly in regions of
western Kenya. Between April 2015 and June 2016, we enrolled 965 apparently
healthy children aged 0-15 years in former Nyanza and Western Provinces in Kenya 
to characterize the demographic, geographic, and household risk factors of
asymptomatic malaria as part of an epidemiologic study to investigate the risk
factors for endemic Burkitt lymphoma. The children were sampled using a
stratified, multistage cluster sampling survey design. Malaria was assessed by
rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and thick-film microscopy (TFM). Primary analyses of 
Pf malaria prevalence (pfPR) are based on RDT. Associations between weighted pfPR
and potential risk factors were evaluated using logistic regression, accounting
for the survey design. Plasmodium falciparum malaria prevalence was 36.0% (27.5%,
44.5%) by RDT and 22.3% (16.0%, 28.6%) by TFM. Plasmodium falciparum malaria
prevalence was positively associated with living in the lake-endemic area
(adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.46; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.63, 7.37),
paternal occupation as peasant farmer (aOR 1.87; 1.08, 3.26) or manual laborer
(aOR 1.83; 1.00, 3.37), and keeping dogs (aOR 1.62; 0.98-2.69) or cows (aOR 1.52;
0.96-2.40) inside or near the household. Plasmodium falciparum malaria prevalence
was inversely associated with indoor residual insecticide spraying (IRS) (aOR
0.44; 0.19, 1.01), having a household connected to electricity (aOR 0.47; 0.22,
0.98), and a household with two (aOR 0.45; 0.22, 0.93) or ≥ three rooms (aOR
0.41; 0.18, 0.93). We report high but geographically heterogeneous pfPR in
children in western Kenya and significant associations with IRS and
household-level socioeconomic factors.

Background: Anemia during pregnancy is a public health problem especially in
developing countries and it is associated with maternal and perinatal adverse
outcomes. There is no meta-analysis on anemia during pregnancy in Sudan. The
current systemic review and meta-analysis was conducted to assess the prevalence,
types and determinant of anemia during pregnancy in Sudan.
Methods: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
(PRISMA) guideline was followed. The databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, Google 
Scholar, CINAHL, and African Journals Online) were searched using; anemia,
pregnancy related anemia and Sudan. Joanna Briggs Institute Meta-Analysis of
Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-MAStARI) and Modified Newcastle 
- Ottawa quality assessment scale were used for critical appraisal of studies.
The pooled Meta logistic regression was computed using OpenMeta Analyst software.
Results: Sixteen cross-sectional studies included a total of 15, 688 pregnant
women were analyzed. The pooled prevalence of anemia among pregnant women in
Sudan was 53.0% (95%, CI = 45.9-60.1). The meta-analysis showed no statistical
significant between the age (mean difference = 0.143, 95 CI = - 0.033 - 0.319,
P = 0.112), parity (mean difference = 0.021, 95% CI = - 0.035 - 0.077, P = 0.465)
between the anemic and no anemic women. Malaria was investigated in six studies. 
Pregnant women who had malaria infection during pregnancy were 1.94 times more
likely to develop anemia than women who had no malaria infection (OR = 1.94, 95% 
CI =1.33-2.82). Six (37.5%) studies investigated type of anemia. The pooled
prevalence of iron deficiency anemia (IDA) among pregnant women in Sudan was
13.6% (95% CI = 8.9-18.2).
Conclusion: There is a high prevalence of anemia among pregnant in the different 
region of Sudan. While age and parity have no association with anemia, malaria
infection was associated with anemia. Interventions to promote the strengthening 
of antenatal care, and access and adherence to nutrition, and malaria preventive 
measures are needed to reduce the high level of anemia among pregnant women in
Sudan.

HIV care and treatment clinics (CTC) are important for management of HIV
morbidity and mortality, and to reduce HIV transmission. Enrollment in HIV care
and treatment clinics remains low in many developing countries. We followed up
632 newly diagnosed HIV patients aged 15 years and above from Magu District,
Tanzania. Logistic regression was used to assess factors significantly associated
with enrollment for CTC services. Kaplan-Meier plots and log-rank tests were used
to evaluate differences in timing uptake of services. Among 632 participants, 214
(33.9%) were enrolled in CTC, and of those enrolled 120 (56.6%) took longer than 
3 months to enroll. Those living in more rural villages were less likely to be
enrolled than in the villages with semi-urban settings (OR 0.36; 95% CI
0.17-0.76). Moreover, those with age group 35-44 years and with age group
45 years and above were 2 times higher odds compared to those with age group
15-24 years, (OR 2.03; 95% CI 1.05-3.91) and (OR 2.69; 95% CI 1.40-5.18)
respectively. Enrollment in the CTC in Tanzania is low. To increase uptake of
antiretroviral therapy, it is critical to improve linkage between HIV testing and
care services, and to rollout these services into the primary health facilities.

BACKGROUND: Long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) are a key malaria control
intervention. To investigate factors associated with ownership and use of LLINs
in Uganda, a cross-sectional community survey was conducted in March-June 2017,
approximately 3 years after a national Universal Coverage Campaign (UCC).
METHODS: Households from 104 clusters (health sub-districts) in 48 districts were
randomly selected using two-staged cluster sampling; 50 households were enrolled 
per cluster. Outcomes were household ownership of LLINs (at least one LLIN),
adequate LLIN coverage (at least one LLIN per 2 residents), and use of LLINs
(resident slept under a LLIN the previous night). Associations between variables 
of interest and outcomes were made using multivariate logistic regression.
RESULTS: In total, 5196 households, with 29,627 residents and 6980 bed-nets, were
included in the analysis. Overall, 65.0% of households owned at least one LLIN
(down from 94% in 2014). In the adjusted analysis, factors most strongly
associated with LLIN ownership were living in a wealthier household (highest
tercile vs lowest; adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.94, 95% CI 1.66-2.28, p < 0.001)
and time since the last UCC (29-37 vs 42-53 months; aOR 1.91, 95% CI 1.60-2.28,
p < 0.001). Only 17.9% of households had adequate LLIN coverage (down from 65% in
2014). Factors most strongly associated with adequate coverage were fewer
residents (2-4 vs ≥ 7; aOR 6.52, 95% CI 5.13-8.29, p < 0.001), living in a
wealthier household (highest tercile vs lowest; aOR: 2,32, 95% CI 1.88-2.85,
p < 0.001) and time since the last UCC (29-37 vs 42-53 months; aOR 2.13, 95% CI
1.61-2.81, p < 0.001). Only 39.5% of residents used a LLIN the previous night.
Age was strongly associated with LLIN use, as were household wealth and time
since the last UCC. Children < 5 years (44.7%) and residents > 15 years (44.1%)
were more likely to use nets than children aged 5-15 years (30.7%; < 5 years: aOR
1.71, 95% CI 1.62-1.81, p < 0.001; > 15 years: aOR 1.37, 95% CI 1.29-1.45,
p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Long-lasting insecticidal net ownership and coverage have reduced
markedly in Uganda since the last net distribution campaign in 2013/14. Houses
with many residents, poorer households, and school-aged children should be
targeted to improve LLIN coverage and use. Trial registration This study is
registered with ISRCTN (17516395).

BACKGROUND: In Malawi, children under the age of five living in different
geographical areas may experience different malaria risk factors. We compare the 
risk factors of malaria experienced by children under the age of five from Zomba 
district, who reside in lakeshore and highland areas.
METHODS: We conducted a case control study of 765 caregivers, cases being
children under-five who were diagnosed with malaria, and obtained matched
controls from local health facilities and communities. We used a multivariate
logistic regression to identify individual and household risk factors.
RESULTS: In lakeshore areas, risk factors were households located one kilometer
or less away from stagnant water (AOR: 2.246 95% CI: 1.269 to 3.975 P-value:
0.005); or if the household had obtained a mosquito bed net more than one year
ago (AOR: 1.946 95% CI: 1.073 to 3.529 P-value: 0.028). In highland areas, risk
factors were households which used a borehole/unprotected well (AOR: 1.962 95%
CI: 1.001 to 3.844 P-value 0.050), communal standpipe (AOR: 3.293 95% CI: 1.301
to 8.332 P-value 0.012), and un-protected dug well in their yards (AOR: 16.195
95% CI: 2.585 to 101.464 P-value 0.003) as their drinking water sources. In
highland areas, caregivers not attending health talks on malaria prevention
messages was a risk factor (AOR: 2.518 95% CI: 1.439 to 4.406 P-value: 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Children under the age of five living in highland areas experience
different malaria risk factors compared to children living in lakeshore areas.
Settling away from stagnant/open water source in lakeshore and encouraging
caregivers to attend health talks on malaria prevention in highlands can help
reduce malaria transmission. Nevertheless, using a mosquito bed net that is more 
than one year old is a common risk factor in both locations. Using new mosquito
bed nets can significantly reduce the risk of contracting malaria in children
under the age of five.

BACKGROUND: Malaria is a major public health problem in Zambia with an estimated 
4 million confirmed cases and 2389 deaths reported in 2015. Efforts to reduce the
incidence of malaria are often undermined by a number of factors such as human
mobility which may lead to introduction of imported infections. The aim of this
study was to establish the burden of malaria attributed to human mobility in
Lusaka district and identify factors associated with malaria importation among
residents of Lusaka district.
METHODS: A cross sectional study was conducted in five randomly selected health
facilities in Lusaka district from November 2015 to February 2016. Data was
collected from 260 patients who presented with malaria and whose status was
confirmed by rapid diagnostic test or microscopy. Each confirmed malaria case was
interviewed using a structured questionnaire to establish their demographic
characteristics, travel history and preventive measures. Travel history was used 
as a proxy to classify cases as either imported or local. Residency was also used
as a secondary proxy for importation to compare characteristics of residents vs
non-residents in relation to malaria importation. Logistic regression was used to
determine factors associated with malaria importation among residents of Lusaka
district.
RESULTS: Out of 260 cases, 94.2% were classified as imported cases based on
participants' travel history. There were 131 (50.4%) males and 129 (49.6%)
females. Age distribution ranged from 0 to 68 years with a median age of 15 years
(IQR 8-27). Imported cases came from all the ten provinces of Zambia with the
Copperbelt Province being the highest contributor (41%). Of all imported cases,
use of prophylaxis was found to be highly protective [AOR = 0.22 (95% CI
0.06-0.82); p-value = 0.024]. Other factors that significantly influence malaria 
transmission and importation by residents include duration of stay in a highly
endemic region [AOR = 1.25 (95% CI 1.09-1.44); p-value = 0.001] and frequency of 
travel [AOR = 3.71 (95% CI 1.26-10.84); p-value = 0.017].
CONCLUSION: Human mobility has influenced malaria transmission in Lusaka district
through a number of factors by importing infections. This leads to onward
transmission and poses a challenge to malaria elimination and control. However,
taking of prophylaxis is highly protective and must be highly recommended.

BACKGROUND: As malaria is among the leading public health problems globally,
early diagnosis and treatment of cases is one of the key interventions for its
control and elimination. Nevertheless, little is known about early
treatment-seeking behaviour for malaria of people in Ethiopia. This study was
conducted to investigate early treatment-seeking behaviour and associated factors
among febrile patients in Dera district, one of the malaria hotspot districts in 
Ethiopia.
METHODS: An institution-based, cross-sectional study was conducted among
malaria-suspected febrile patients in Dera district, Amhara Regional State,
Ethiopia from September to December 2017. The study used the lottery method to
select sample health facilities, and participant allocation to facilities was
done in proportion to client flow to the respective health facilities. Data were 
collected by interview. Thus, binary logistic regression model was fitted to the 
data. Crude and adjusted odds ratios with the respective confidence intervals and
p-values were computed. An explanatory variable with a p-value ≤ 0.05 was
considered statistically significant. SPSS version 20 was used for the analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 680 respondents completed the study with a response rate of
96.6%. The study revealed that 356 (52.4%) participants sought treatment within
24 h of fever onset, and patients who: knew the advantage of sleeping under nets 
[AOR 95% CI 2.8 (1.70-4.60)]; knew mosquito breeding sites [AOR 95% CI 1.9
(1.10-3.30)]; had good, overall knowledge about malaria [AOR 95% CI 2.7
(1.56-4.76)]; had previous history of malaria [AOR 95% CI 3.26 (1.64-6.49)]; were
at a distance of < 6 km from a health centre [AOR 95% CI 2.5 (1.72-3.60)]; and,
had family size < 5 [AOR 95% CI 2.1 (1.43-3.20)], were more likely to seek
treatment within 24 hof fever onset.
CONCLUSION: A low proportion of malaria-suspected patients sought treatment
within 24 h of fever onset compared to the national target. Awareness about the
advantage of sleeping under nets, knowledge about mosquito breeding sites and
malaria itself, previous history of malaria, distance from the health centres,
and family size were found to be predictors of early treatment-seeking behaviour 
for malaria. Strengthening strategies tailored to increasing awareness for
communities about malaria prevention methods and early treatment-seeking
behaviour is essential.

INTRODUCTION: Anemia is defined as a low blood hemoglobin concentration
(< 11 mg/dl). It is a global public health problem especially in pregnant women
and is associated with higher risk for both maternal and perinatal mortality and 
morbidity. In developing countries, like Ethiopia where anemia is common,
determining the magnitude and identifying factors that are associated with anemia
is necessary to control it.
METHODS: Facility based cross sectional study design were conducted among 638
pregnant women attending antenatal care in public health centers in central zone 
of Tigray region, Northern Ethiopia from November 1/2017 to January 30/2018 using
stratified multi stage sampling method. The data was collected through
interviewing the pregnant women face to face after getting informed consent using
structured and pre-tested questionnaire. The data was coded and entered in to
Epi-info 7 then exported to Stata 14 for cleaning and further analysis. Both
Bivariable and multi variable logistic regression model was used in the data
analysis.
RESULTS: The overall magnitude of anemia (hemoglobin level < 11 mg/dl) were found
that 16.88% (95% CI: 13.95%, 19.8%). Factors which were significantly associated 
with anemia in the multivariable analysis were: history of malaria attack 1 year 
prior to study period (AOR = 4.73, 95% CI: 2.64, 8.46), women who had history of 
excessive menstrual bleeding (AOR = 3.94, 95% CI: 2.11, 7.35), unplanned
pregnancy (AOR = 2.5, 95% CI: 1.4, 4.42) and three times or less meal frequency
(AOR = 1.89, 95% CI: 1.02, 3.5).
CONCLUSION: The magnitude of anemia among pregnant were found that 16.88%.
Malaria attack, excessive menstrual bleeding, pregnancy planning and meal
frequency were found that significantly associated with anemia in the
multivariable analysis. Pregnant women are recommended to increase meal
frequency. Health providers should give attention to pregnant women who had
history of malaria attack, excessive menstrual bleeding and women whose pregnancy
were not planned.

BACKGROUND: Malaria incidence has been steadily declining in Cambodia, where the 
government is aiming to eliminate malaria by 2025. Successful malaria elimination
requires active engagement and participation of communities to recognize malaria 
symptoms and the development of prompt treatment-seeking behavior for early
diagnosis and appropriate treatment. This study examined malaria knowledge,
preventive actions, and treatment-seeking behavior among different groups of
ethnic minorities and Khmer in Ratanakiri Province, Cambodia.
METHODS: Face-to-face interviews were conducted in December 2015, targeting 388
mothers with children under 2 years old, who belonged to ten ethnic minority
groups or the Khmer group living in 62 rural villages in Ratanakiri. In addition 
to describing mothers' knowledge and actions for malaria prevention, logistic
regression analysis was performed to identify determinants of fever during the
most recent pregnancy and among children under two.
RESULTS: Overall 388 mothers were identified for enrollment into the study of
which 377 (97.2%) were included in analyses. The majority of mothers slept under 
bed nets at home (95.8%) and wore long-sleeved clothes (83.8%) for malaria
prevention. However, knowledge of malaria was limited: 44.6% were aware of
malaria symptoms, 40.6% knew the malaria transmission route precisely, and 29.2% 
knew of mosquito breeding places. Staying overnight at a farm hut was
significantly associated with having fever during the most recent pregnancy
(adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.008, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.215-3.321) and 
a child having fever (AOR 3.681, 95% CI 1.943-6.972). Mothers' partaking in a
variety of malaria preventive actions was protective against fever in children
(AOR 0.292, 95% CI: 0.136-0.650). Among those who had fever during pregnancy,
39.4% did not seek treatment.
CONCLUSION: Although the majority of mothers took malaria preventive actions,
knowledge of malaria epidemiology and vector ecology and treatment-seeking
behavior for fever were limited. Staying overnight at farm huts, regardless of
the differences in socio-demographic and socio-cultural characteristics, was
strongly associated with fever episodes during pregnancy and childhood. This
study indicates the necessity of spreading accurate malaria knowledge, raising
awareness of health risks related to agricultural practices, and promoting
treatment-seeking behavior among ethnic minorities to strengthen their engagement
in malaria elimination.

Nets versus spraying: A spatial modelling approach reveals indoor residual
spraying targets Anopheles mosquito habitats better than mosquito nets in
Tanzania.

The global implementation of malaria interventions has averted hundreds of
millions of clinical malaria cases in the last decade. This study assesses
predicted Anopheles mosquito distributions across the United Republic of Tanzania
before large-scale insecticide-treated net (ITN) rollouts and indoor residual
spraying (IRS) initiatives to determine whether mosquito net usage by children
under the age of five and IRS are targeted to areas where historical evidence
indicates mosquitoes thrive. Demographic and Health Surveys data from 2011-2012
and 2015-2016 include detailed measurements of mosquito net and IRS use across
Tanzania. Anopheline data are far less intensively collected, but we constructed 
a Maxent-built baseline mosquito habitat suitability (MHS) map (AUC = 0.872) with
Tanzanian Anopheles occurrence records from 1999-2003. This MHS model was tested 
against independently-observed georeferenced Plasmodium falciparum cases from the
Malaria Atlas Project, with ~87% of cases from 1999-2003 (n = 107) and ~84% of
cases from 1985-2012 (n = 919) occurring in areas of high predicted suitability
for mosquitoes. We compared the validated MHS with subsequent malaria
interventions using mixed effects logistic regression. Specifically, we assessed 
whether Anopheles habitat suitability related to the frequency that ≥1 child in a
household reportedly slept under a mosquito net when that intervention later
became widely available, and whether IRS was reportedly applied to dwellings over
a one-year period. There was no evidence that mosquito net use the night before
the survey related to MHS from 2011-2012 and marginally significant evidence
(p<0.05) from 2015-2016 (β = 1.466, 95% C.I. = 0.848-2.103, marginal R2 = 0.020, 
respectively). However, the likelihood of IRS treatments rose relatively strongly
in the 12 months prior to both surveys (β = 13.466, 95% C.I. = 10.488-16.456,
marginal R2 = 0.144, and β = 6.817, 95% C.I. = 5.439-8.303, marginal R2 = 0.136, 
respectively). IRS treatments have therefore been targeted more effectively than 
mosquito nets toward areas where anopheline habitat suitability was previously
found to be high.

Malaria acquired in endemic areas poses a substantial risk to travelers arriving 
in or returning to the United States. Timely diagnosis and recognition of severe 
illness are crucial; however, many U.S.-based clinicians lack familiarity with
this disease. We conducted a retrospective review of 100 cases of malaria in
adults seen at a single urban university hospital during 2000-2017. Descriptive
and analytical statistics were calculated, including logistic regression modeling
case severity. Most of the patients presented with Plasmodium falciparum (76%),
most commonly after travel from sub-Saharan Africa (94%). Prior malaria
experience was common (50%), but adherence to a prophylactic regimen was
exceedingly rare (4%). Twenty-one patients had severe malaria, including 10 with 
cerebral malaria. Severity was predicted by high parasitemia, bandemia,
hypoglycemia, and hypotension at the time of presentation. In 24 patients, the
initial treatment regimen was changed, usually because of the appearance of
clinical deterioration or drug toxicity. One patient required intravenous
artesunate. All patients survived, although one suffered fetal loss. Among 30
patients initially evaluated at other institutions, 43% had been treated for an
alternative diagnosis. The most common reasons for transfer of patients to our
hospital were inadequate facilities and lack of expertise with malaria. There
needs to be increased awareness among U.S.-based travelers and clinicians
regarding malaria as a potentially lethal condition, emphasizing the use of
appropriate prophylaxis. Our simple model of disease severity could serve
frontline physicians when deciding which patients should be admitted to the
intensive care unit or transferred for higher level care.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the malaria rapid diagnostic testing (RDT) - related
knowledge, attitude, practice (KAP) of primary healthcare professionals in
Jiangsu Province and analyze the corresponding influencing factors.
METHODS: Four cities in Jiangsu Province were selected as the study sites by the 
typical sampling method to conduct a survey for the RDT related KAP and work
satisfaction of primary healthcare professionals, and the multiple logistic
regression model was used to explore the relevant influencing factors.
RESULTS: Totally 1 150 questionnaires were issued and 949 valid questionnaires
were collected with the recovery rate of 82.52%. The valid questionnaires
included 453 questionnaires from laboratory technicians, 466 from clinicians, and
30 from malaria prevention and control workers. Totally 83.98% of the surveyed
professionals had a low mastering level of essential RDT-related knowledge. A
total of 52.17% of the surveyed laboratory technicians recognized that the
application of RDT technology could effectively improve the current primary-level
microscopy work, and the degree of recognition of RDT technological advantage in 
the laboratory technicians was higher than that in the clinicians. Totally 79.25%
of the surveyed laboratory technicians regarded themselves to be capable of
conducting the standardized RDT operation, and 84.55% of the surveyed clinicians 
regarded themselves to be capable of conducting the qualified malaria clinical
diagnostic practice. The key influencing factors of RDT-related KAP of primary
healthcare professionals included the laboratory technicians' gender, educational
level, employer's institutional level, professional title, and working years, and
the employer's institutional level of clinicians.
CONCLUSIONS: The primary healthcare professionals in Jiangsu Province exhibita
good acceptability towards RDT technology. However, their essential knowledge on 
RDT remains to be improved. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a specific
training and educational system for primary healthcare professionals to better
guarantee the advantageous impact of RDT technology on the consolidation of the
malaria elimination work achievements.

The extent of abnormalities in blood indices and their subsequent effects on
clinical severity in malaria differ among populations of different endemicity.
However, these alterations have not been well investigated in Odisha, India and
their prognostic implications in the context of multi-organ dysfunction (MODS) in
severe malaria (SM) are not identified so far. The present study was carried out 
in 200 adult patients each from uncomplicated malaria and severe malaria groups
to examine whether host haematological and biochemical parameters in Plasmodium
falciparum infection can act as diagnostic marker for SM in adults patients of
Odisha. The results showed thrombocytopenia as a potential risk factor for SM
irrespective of disease features with least median platelet counts observed in
patients with MODS (Platelet count: 144.5, P = < 0.0001) compared to mild
malaria. Logistic regression analysis identified anemia (<10 mg/dl) as
independent predictor of MODS (OR = 12.78, 95% CI = 4.93-33.2). The prognostic
utility of thrombocytopenia (platelet count: ≤100,000/μl) as marker of MODS was
largely modulated by hemoglobin and blood glucose level. Co-existence of
hypoglycemia and thrombocytopenia was also observed. Our study revealed changes
in blood indices such as low platelet, hemoglobin and blood glucose during
falciparum infection in adults can be used as diagnostic criteria for predicting 
SM in combinations. The study also provides important clue for plausible
hypoglycemia mediated platelet necrosis and clearance. Further studies in
different endemic regions need to be conducted for validation of these findings
and their implication as criteria for diagnosing SM in adults.

Background: Coinfections are becoming common risk factors that may contribute to 
the increased burden of morbidity in pregnancy. The aim of this study was to
assess the seroprevalence of coinfections of malaria, hepatitis B (HBV), human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and syphilis among pregnant women attending
antenatal clinics (ANC) in the Tamale Metropolis.
Methods: By means of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), pregnant women attending the 
Tamale Teaching Hospital (TTH) were screened for malaria, HBV infection, HIV
infection, and syphilis from March 2013 to February 2015. Haemoglobin (Hb)
values, sickling, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PDd)
statuses were also assessed using full blood count (FBC), sodium metabisulphite, 
and methaemoglobin reduction tests, respectively. Logistic regression analysis
was performed to estimate the risks/odds ratios (ORs) for the coinfections and
other variables (age, gravidity, and time of the first ANC visit) with 95%
confidence intervals (CIs) and set p values for accepting any differences at
<0.05.
Results: Within the two-year study period, data were collected from 3,127
pregnant women. The mean age (SD) of the pregnant women was 28.5 (±5.0) years. Of
the total number, seroprevalence was high for malaria (11.6%) and HBV infection
(4.2%) and low for HIV infection (1.0%) and syphilis (0.4%) monoinfections.
Mal/HBV coinfection was higher (0.7%) when compared with Mal/HIV (0.1%),
Mal/syphilis (0.0%), HBV/HIV (0.0%), HBV/syphilis (0.1%), and HIV/syphilis (0.0%)
coinfections. The mean Hb (g/dl) for the women with the four monoinfections was
significantly different from one another (p=0.009). Pregnant women with malaria
infection were about 2 times more likely to be coinfected with HBV even after
adjusting for potential confounders (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.66, 95%
CI = 1.04-2.65, p=0.031). Those in their third trimester and visiting the ANC for
the first time were significantly less likely to be infected with HBV
(AOR = 0.45, 95% CI = 0.28-0.73, p=0.001), with malaria/HBV coinfection
(AOR = 0.09, 95% CI = 0.01-0.68, p=0.020), and with any coinfection (AOR = 0.19, 
95% CI = 0.06-0.63, p=0.007).
Conclusion: A comparatively high seroprevalence of malaria and its coinfection
with HBV in pregnant women was observed in this study. Considering the effects
that both malaria and HBV have on the liver, it would be expedient to conduct
further studies to assess liver function among malaria/HBV-infected individuals, 
while interventions to prevent coinfections among pregnant women are intensified.

Synergistic Protective Effect of Sickle Cell Trait and Blood Group-O on the Risk 
of Endemic Burkitt's Lymphoma.

BACKGROUND: Previous research strongly suggest that malaria is an important
factor in the pathogenesis of endemic Burkitt's lymphoma (eBL). Therefore,
genetic factors such as sickle cell trait (SCT) and blood group-O that offer
protection against severe malaria would be expected to reduce the risks of eBL.
However, previous reports on the protective roles of SCT and blood group-O
against the risks of eBL were inconclusive. Hence, the need for further studies
on the protective roles of SCT and blood group-O separately, and also to
investigate whether or not the combined anti-severe malaria protective roles of
SCT and blood group-O have synergistic effects in reducing the risks of eBL. We
therefore hypothesize that SCT and blood group-O are independently associated
with reduced risks of eBL, and the co-inheritance of both factors (SCT and
group-O) would provide greater protection against eBL. If our hypothesis is
correct, children who inherited both SCT and blood group-O would have lower risks
of eBL than their counterparts who inherited SCT or blood group-O separately. To 
the best of our knowledge, the possible synergistic relationship between SCT and 
blood group-O with regards to the risk of eBL has not been previously studied.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective logistic regression analysis
of the frequencies of Hb phenotypes and ABO blood groups among patients with eBL 
in order to determine the separate and synergistic protective effects of SCT and 
blood group-O on the risk of eBL in Nigeria where eBL is among the most common
malignant childhood cancers.
RESULTS: The Odd Ratios (OR) for the risk of eBL were 0.52 for 'SCT irrespective 
of ABO blood group'; 0.49 for 'blood group-O irrespective of Hb phenotype'; and
0.23 for 'SCT with blood group-O'.
DISCUSSION: These values suggest that both SCT and blood group-O are
independently associated with modest reduction in the risk of eBL. However, when 
SCT with blood group-O was assessed for the risk factor for eBL, we obtained an
Odds ratio of 0.23, which was significantly lower than the OR values for SCT
(0.52) and blood group-O (0.49) separately. These figures suggest that
coinheritance of SCT and blood group-O offers greater reduction in the risk of
eBL than that provided by either SCT or blood group-O separately. The greater
protection against eBL provided by the coinheritance of SCT and blood group-O is 
interpreted to be the resultant synergistic effect of the combined anti-malarial 
attributes of SCT and blood group-O.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the combined anti-malarial protective
roles of SCT and blood group-O have synergistic effects in reducing the risks of 
eBL. This study has provided further evidence on the association between
malaria-protective genetic polymorphisms and eBL, which is consistent with the
aetiologic role of malaria in the pathogenesis of the tumour. Hence, the need for
malaria endemic countries to intensify malaria control programs in order to
curtail the incidence of eBL.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to identify factors at individual and community
level influencing insecticide-treated net (ITN) usage among groups of women of
childbearing age (WOCBA) in Malawi.
METHODS: Factors influencing ITN usage in Malawi were assessed through interviews
with 16,130 WOCBA (15-49 years) across 850 communities who participated in the
2015-2016 Malawi Demographic Health Survey. Multilevel logistic regression
analysis was used.
RESULTS: ITN use was similar between pregnant women and non-pregnant women with
children under 5 years (45.9% and 46.9%, respectively), but slightly lower among 
non-pregnant women without children under 5 years (39.1%). Both individual and
community characteristics were associated with ITN use among WOCBA and varied
significantly across subgroups. Specifically, non-pregnant women with children
under 5 years living in communities where women had high autonomy in health care 
decisions had an 18% greater odds of using an ITN compared with those from
communities where women had low health care autonomy (adjusted odds ratio
[aOR] = 1.18; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00-1.38). Distance to health care
facility influenced ITN usage among pregnant women; those who did not regard
distance as a problem had a 44% greater odds of using an ITN than those for whom 
distance was seen as a problem (aOR = 1.44; 95% CI 1.09-1.89). Number of
household members, region, urbanization, and community ITN coverage influenced
ITN usage across all WOCBA groups.
CONCLUSION: The findings confirmed the importance of assessing various factors
affecting ITN usage among groups of WOCBA. Both individual- and community-level
factors should be considered when designing and implementing ITN programmes in
Malawi.

BACKGROUND: While the distribution of mosquito bed nets is a widely adopted
approach for malaria prevention, studies exploring how the usage of a net may be 
influenced by its source and other factors remain sparse.
METHODS: A standardized questionnaire and home-visit observations were used to
collect data from 9 villages in Budondo sub-county, Uganda in 2016. Household-
and individual-level data were collected, such as bed net ownership (at least one
net versus none), acquirement source (free versus purchased), demographics, as
well as knowledge of malaria and preventative measures. Net-level data, including
alternative uses, and bed net quantity and integrity, were also collected. Mixed 
effects logistic regression models were performed to identify the key
determinants of bed net use.
RESULTS: Overall, the proportion of households with at least one bed net was 40%,
while bed net availability was only reported among 27% of all household members. 
Awareness of the benefits of bed net use was statistically significantly
associated with ownership of at least one net (OR = 1.72, 95% CI 1.11-2.68,
p = 0.02). Among those who own net(s), the odds of a bed net being correctly used
(i.e., to sleep under) after adjusting for potential confounders were
significantly lower for nets that were obtained free compared to nets that were
purchased by the owners themselves (OR = 0.33, 95% CI 0.21-0.51, p < 0.01),
resulting in an alternative use of the net. Other factors such as female gender, 
children ≤ 5 years old, and pregnancy status were also significantly associated
with having a net to sleep under (all p < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Understanding inter- and intra-household net-use factors will help
malaria control programmes more effectively direct their efforts to increase
public health impact. Future studies may additionally consider socioeconomic
status and track the lifetime of the net.

BACKGROUND: Despite the high prevalence of malaria among pregnant women and its
associated complications, the level of compliance with insecticide-treated nets
(ITN) remains very low. Motivation and self-efficacy have been reported as
important determinants of health behaviour, and may be important factors to
consider in developing health intervention programmes. The aim of this study was 
to determine the knowledge, motivation and self-efficacy of ITN use, and their
association with its practice, among pregnant women in a secondary health centre 
in Maiduguri.
METHODS: The study utilized a cross-sectional study design, using a structured
and pre-tested questionnaire to obtain information from 380 respondents.
Respondents were classified as ITN users if they slept under an ITN for at least 
3 days in a week, while those who did not at all, or slept under it less
frequently were classified as ITN non-users. Chi squared test was performed to
test the bivariate association between ITN use and each of the items of the
questionnaire. A further multivariate logistic regression was performed to
determine the predictors of ITN use.
RESULTS: The respondents' ages ranged from 15 to 45 years, with median
(interquartile range) age of 25 (8) years. Eighty percent of them were aware of
ITN, but 50.5% believed ITNs could be dangerous. Only 5.5% and 0.8% respectively 
felt that sleeping under and ITN was either just bad or very bad for their
health. Thirty-five percent of the respondents were ITN users. Not having a
previous miscarriage (OR = 2.38; 95% CI 1.41-4.03, p = 0.001), knowledge that
ITNs were not to be washed after every 1 month (OR = 3.60; 95% CI 1.18-11.06),
significant others thinking they should sleep under an ITN (OR = 3.06; 95% CI
1.35-6.96), ability to effectively persuade others to sleep under an ITN
(OR = 2.37; 95% CI 1.14-4.94) were significantly associated with ITN use.
CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of pregnant women in this study were not sleeping
under ITNs. The development of health promotion interventions aimed at boosting
their self-efficacies for ITN use, and improving social support from their
spouses are, therefore, recommended. Health education on ITN use should also be
incorporated into post-abortal management.

Background: Oral Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) status reflects host EBV activity and
potentially links to EBV-associated diseases, however, factors influencing oral
EBV loads or reactivation, such as environmental exposures or host factors, are
not fully understood.
Methods: A 2-stage, multicenter, cross-sectional study of 6558 subjects from 21
administrative cities of southern China and 3 populations from representative
geographical areas in China (referred to as the south, north, and northeastern
populations) was performed. The relationships between demographical factors and
environmental exposures to EBV loads were analyzed by logistic regression models.
Results: Current smoking, with a dose-response effect, was found to be strongly
associated with higher oral EBV loads in the pooled data, with an odds ratio of
1.58 (95% confidence interval, 1.39-1.79), as well as in each of the separate
populations. The odds ratio increased to 3.06 when current smokers in southern
China were compared to never smokers in northern China. Additionally, higher oral
EBV loads tended to be detected in older participants, male participants, and
participants in southern China.
Conclusions: This study provided evidence linking the effect of
host-environmental factors, particularly smoking, to oral EBV activity. It could 
strengthen our understanding of the possible causal roles of EBV-related
diseases, which may help to prevent or mitigate EBV-associated diseases.

BACKGROUND: Malaria is the main cause of hospital admissions in Benin and a
leading cause of death in childhood. Beside consultations, various studies have
underlined the management of the disease through home treatment. The medicines
used can be purchased in informal market of pharmaceutical drugs (IMPD) without
prescription or any involvement of healthcare professional. Pharmaceutical drugs 
are sold by informal private vendors, who operate at any time in the immediate
environment of the patients. The present study was conducted in Cotonou to study 
the health-seeking behaviour of caregivers to treat malaria in children under
12 years old. Factors associated with malaria home treatment and drugs purchase
in IMPD were studied.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out among 340 children's caregivers 
who were interviewed about their socio-demographic characteristics and their
care-seeking behaviour during the most recent episode of malaria in their
children under 12. Medicines used and purchase place were also collected.
Multivariate logistic regression model was used to determine factors associated
with malaria home treatment and drug purchase in IMPD.
RESULTS: Beyond all the 340 caregivers, 116 (34%) consulted healthcare
professional, 224 (66%) home treat the children, among whom 207 (61%) gave
pharmaceutical drugs and 17 (5%) gave traditional remedies to children. Malaria
home treatment was associated with family size, health insurance (OR = 0.396, 95%
CI 0.169-0.928), and wealth quintiles where home treatment was less used by the
richest (OR = 0.199, 95% CI 0.0676-0.522) compared to those in the poorest
quintile. The caregivers age group 30-39 years was associated to the use of IMPD 
(OR = 0.383, 95% CI 0.152-0.964), the most economically wealthy people were less 
likely to use IMPD (wealth quintile richest: OR = 0.239, 95% CI 0.064-0.887;
wealth quintile fourth OR = 0.271, 95% CI 0.100-0.735) compared to those in the
poorest quintile. All caregivers who benefited from health insurance did not use 
IMPD.
CONCLUSION: This study highlights the link between worse economic conditions and 
accessibility to medical care as one of the main factors of malaria home
treatment and drug purchase in IMPD, even if those two phenomena need to be
understood apart.

BACKGROUND: In rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa, health facilities are difficult
to access for prompt treatment of malaria. Community health workers (CHWs) have
been trained and equipped to treat malaria. Utilization of their service has not 
been adequately evaluated. The aim of this study was to determine the level of
utilization of CHWs, and whether distance and other factors influence the
utilization.
METHODS: The authors conducted a cross-sectional study among households with a
child below 5 y of age and interviewed caregivers in Sheema district, rural
western Uganda. Logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted ORs (aOR) for 
factors associated with use of CHW services.
RESULTS: Among 547 households, 64% (338/528) reported using CHWs as the first
point of consultation for their febrile children. Factors associated with the use
of CHWs services were lower asset index (aOR=1.9, p=0.02), mother being the
decision maker for site of first consultation (aOR=1.9, p=0.01), distance to
nearest CHW of <3 km (aOR=2.1, p=0.03) compared to >3 km, and trust for CHWs
services (aOR=7.8, p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: Proximal location to a CHW is associated with use of CHW services.
Programs should ensure that CHW are well located to enable easy access.

BACKGROUND: Malaria, anaemia and malnutrition are frequently co-existing diseases
that cause significant morbidity and mortality particularly among children. This 
study measured the prevalence, intensity and evaluated risk factors for malaria
parasitaemia, anaemia and malnutrition among children living at low versus high
altitude settings in the Mount Cameroon area.
METHODS: A cross-sectional community based survey involving 828 children aged
6 months to 14 years was conducted between July and November 2017. Malaria
parasitaemia was confirmed by light microscopy, haemoglobin concentration was
measured using an auto haematology analyser, nutritional status was determined
from the anthropometric measurements collected, and socioeconomic status related 
variables by the use of questionnaire. Anaemia and malnutrition were defined
according to World Health Organization standards. Associations between predictor 
variables and primary outcomes were assessed using logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: Malaria parasite and anaemia were prevalent in 41.7% and 56.2% of the
children, respectively while, malnutrition prevalence was 34.8% with wasting,
underweight and stunting occurring in 25.7%, 19.9% and 23.7% of them
respectively. Overall malaria parasite geometric mean density was 413/µL of blood
(range 100-27,060). The odds of having malaria parasitaemia was highest in
children 5-9 years of age [odd ratio (OR) = 1.69, P = 0.006], living in lowland
(OR = 1.48, P = 0.008) as well as those whose domestic water was collected from
an open source (streams/springs) (OR = 1.81, P = 0.005) than their counterparts. 
Being < 5 years (OR = 3.15, P = < 0.001) or 5-9 years (OR = 2.20, P < 0.001) of
age, having malaria parasite (OR = 2.07, P = < 0.001) and fever in the past
2 days (OR = 1.52, P < 0.04) were identified as significant risk factors of
anaemia while the age group < 5 years was the only significant risk (OR = 3.09,
P = < 0.001) associated with malnutrition.
CONCLUSION: While age specific attention should be given in the control of
malaria (5-9 years), anaemia (< 10 years) and malnutrition (< 5 years), the
existing malaria control programmes should be revised to integrate anaemia and
malnutrition control strategies so as to improve upon the health of the children.

Background: Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), due to Leishmania infantum, is a
persistent intracellular parasitic infection transmitted by the bite of infected 
sand flies. Symptomatic VL has been reported in U.S. soldiers with Iraq
deployment. Untreated symptomatic VL can be fatal; asymptomatic VL (AVL) may
establish a lifelong risk of reactivation. We report prevalence and AVL risk
factors in Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) deployers during 2002-11.
Methods: Healthy soldiers exposed to VL endemic areas in Iraq and 50 controls who
never traveled to endemic regions were recruited through military healthcare
facilities (2015-17). Responses to a risk factor survey and blood samples were
obtained. Leishmania research diagnostics utilized included ELISA, rk39 test
strips, quantitative PCR, and interferon gamma release (IGRA) assays. Statistical
analyses included Fisher's exact test, Pearson's Chi square test, Mann-Whitney U 
test, and logistic regression.
Results: 200 deployed subjects were enrolled, mostly males (84.0%), of white
ethnicity (79.0%), and median age 41 (range 24-61) years. Vector exposure was
high with 64% seropositive for Ph. alexandri saliva antibodies. Prevalence of AVL
(any positive test result) was 39/200 (19.5%, 95% CI 14.4%-25.8%). No subjects
had positive rK39 test results. Two (1.0%) PCR, ten (5%) ELISA, and 28 (14%) IGRA
samples were positive. Travel to Ninewa governorate increased risk for AVL
(p=0.01).
Conclusion: AVL was identified in 19.5 % of OIF deployers and travel to northwest
Iraq correlated with infection. Further studies are needed to inform risk for
reactivation VL in U.S. veterans and to target additional blood safety and
surveillance measures.

BACKGROUND: Low birth weight (LBW) and preterm birth (PTB) are major contributors
to infant mortality and chronic childhood morbidity. Understanding factors that
contribute to or protect against these adverse birth outcomes is an important
global health priority. Anaemia and iron deficiency are common in malaria-endemic
regions, but there are concerns regarding the value of iron supplementation among
pregnant women in malaria-endemic areas due to reports that iron supplementation 
may increase the risk of malaria. There is a lack of evidence on the impact of
iron deficiency on pregnancy outcomes in malaria-endemic regions.
METHODS: We determined iron deficiency in a cohort of 279 pregnant women in a
malaria-endemic area of Papua New Guinea. Associations with birth weight, LBW and
PTB were estimated using linear and logistic regression. A causal model using
sequential mediation analyses was constructed to assess the association between
iron deficiency and LBW, either independently or mediated through malaria and/or 
anaemia.
RESULTS: Iron deficiency in pregnant women was common (71% at enrolment) and
associated with higher mean birth weights (230 g; 95% confidence interval, CI
118, 514; p < 0.001), and reduced odds of LBW (adjusted odds ratio, aOR = 0.32;
95% CI 0.16, 0.64; p = 0.001) and PTB (aOR = 0.57; 95% CI 0.30, 1.09; p = 0.089).
Magnitudes of effect were greatest in primigravidae (birth weight 351 g; 95% CI
188, 514; p < 0.001; LBW aOR 0.26; 95% CI 0.10, 0.66; p = 0.005; PTB aOR = 0.39, 
95% CI 0.16, 0.97; p = 0.042). Sequential mediation analyses indicated that the
protective association of iron deficiency on LBW was mainly mediated through
mechanisms independent of malaria or anaemia.
CONCLUSIONS: Iron deficiency was associated with substantially reduced odds of
LBW predominantly through malaria-independent protective mechanisms, which has
substantial implications for understanding risks for poor pregnancy outcomes and 
evaluating the benefit of iron supplementation in pregnancy. This study is the
first longitudinal study to demonstrate a temporal relationship between antenatal
iron deficiency and improved birth outcomes. These findings suggest that iron
supplementation needs to be integrated with other strategies to prevent or treat 
infections and undernutrition in pregnancy to achieve substantial improvements in
birth outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Evidence for association between sickle cell and alpha thalassemia
trait and severe malaria is compelling. However, for these polymorphisms
associations with uncomplicated malaria, and for G6PD deficiency associations
with uncomplicated and severe malaria, findings have been inconsistent. We
studied samples from a three-arm case-control study with the objective of
determining associations between common host erythrocyte polymorphisms and both
uncomplicated and severe malaria, including different severe malaria phenotypes.
METHOD: We assessed hemoglobin abnormalities, α-thalassemia, and G6PD deficiency 
by molecular methods in 325 children with severe malaria age-matched to 325
children with uncomplicated malaria and 325 healthy community controls.
Conditional logistic regression was used to measure associations between
specified genotypes and malaria outcomes.
RESULTS: No tested polymorphisms offered significant protection against
uncomplicated malaria. α-thalassemia homozygotes (_α/_α) had increased risk of
uncomplicated malaria (OR 2.40; 95%CI 1.15, 5.03, p = 0.020). HbAS and
α-thalassemia heterozygous (_α/αα) genotypes protected against severe malaria
compared to uncomplicated malaria (HbAS OR 0.46; 0.23, 0.95, p = 0.036; _α/αα OR 
0.51; 0.24, 0.77; p = 0.001) or community (HbAS OR 0.23; 0.11, 0.50; p<0.001;
_α/αα; OR 0.49; 0.32, 0.76; p = 0.002) controls. The α-thalassemia homozygous
(_α/_α) genotype protected against severe malaria when compared to uncomplicated 
malaria controls (OR 0.34; 95%CI 0.156, 0.73, p = 0.005), but not community
controls (OR 1.03; 0.46, 2.27, p = 0.935). Stratifying by the severe malaria
phenotype, compared to community controls, the protective effect of HbAS was
limited to children with severe anemia (OR 0.17; 95%CI 0.04, 0.65; p = 0.009) and
that of _α/αα to those with altered consciousness (OR 0.24; 0.09, 0.59; p =
0.002). A negative epistatic effect was seen between HbAS and _α/αα; protection
compared to uncomplicated malaria controls was not seen in individuals with both 
polymorphisms (OR 0.45; 0.11, 1.84; p = 0.269). G6PD deficiency was not
protective against severe malaria.
CONCLUSION: Associations were complex, with HbAS principally protective against
severe anemia, _α/αα against altered consciousness, and negative epistasis
between the two polymorphisms.

INTRODUCTION: In Nigeria, malaria remains a major burden. There is the
presupposition that household members could have common exposure to malaria
parasite and use of long-lasting insecticidal net (LLIN) could reduce
transmission. This study was conducted to identify factors associated with
asymptomatic malaria parasitaemia and LLIN use among households of confirmed
malaria patients in Abuja, Nigeria.
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted from March to August 2016 in
twelve health facilities selected from three area councils in Abuja, Nigeria.
Participants were selected using multi-stage sampling technique. Overall, we
recruited 602 participants from 107 households linked to 107 malaria patients
attending the health facilities. Data on LLIN ownership, utilization, and house
characteristics were collected using a semi-structured questionnaire. Blood
samples of household members were examined for malaria parasitaemia using
microscopy. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Chi-square, and
logistic regression (α = 0.05).
RESULTS: Median age of respondents was 16.5 years (Interquartile range: 23
years); 55.0% were females. Proportions of households that owned and used at
least one LLIN were 44.8% and 33.6%, respectively. Parasitaemia was detected in
at least one family member of 102 (95.3%) index malaria patients. Prevalence of
asymptomatic malaria parasitaemia among study participants was 421/602 (69.9%).
No association was found between individual LLIN use and malaria parasitaemia
(odds ratio: 0.9, 95% confidence interval (95%CI): 0.6-1.3) among study
participants. Having bushes around the homes was associated with having malaria
parasitaemia (adjusted OR (aOR): 2.7, 95%CI: 1.7-4.2) and less use of LLIN (aOR: 
0.4, 95%CI: 0.2-0.9). Living in Kwali (aOR: 0.1, 95% CI: 0.0-0.2) was associated 
with less use of LLIN.
CONCLUSION: High prevalence of asymptomatic malaria and low use of LLIN among
household members of malaria patients portend the risk of intra-household common 
source of malaria transmission. We recommend household health education on LLIN
use and environmental management. Study to explore the role of preventive
treatment of household members of confirmed malaria patient in curbing
transmission is suggested. Strategies promoting LLIN use need to be intensified
in Kwali.

BACKGROUND: Understanding pattern of antimalarials use at large scale helps
ensuring appropriate use of treatments and preventing the spread of resistant
parasites. We estimated the proportion of individuals in community surveys with
residual antimalarials in their blood and identified the factors associated with 
the presence of the most commonly detected drugs, lumefantrine and/or
desbutyl-lumefantrine (LF/DLF) or sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP).
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2015 in three regions of
Tanzania with different levels of malaria endemicity. Interviews were conducted
and blood samples collected through household surveys for further antimalarial
measurements using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. In 
addition, diagnosis and treatment availability was investigated through outlet
surveys. Multilevel mixed effects logistic regression models were used to
estimate odds ratios for having LF/DLF or SP in the blood.
RESULTS: Amongst 6391 participants, 12.4% (792/6391) had LF/DLF and 8.0%
(510/6391) SP in the blood. Factors associated with higher odds of detecting
LF/DLF in the blood included fever in the previous two weeks (OR = 2.6, p<0.001),
living in districts of higher malaria prevalence (OR = 1.5, p<0.001) and living
in a ward in which all visited drug stores had artemisinin-based combination
therapies in stocks (OR = 2.7, p = 0.020). Participants in older age groups were 
less likely to have LF/DLF in the blood (OR = 0.9, p<0.001). Factors associated
with higher odds of having SP in the blood included being pregnant (OR = 4.6,
p<0.001), living in Mwanza (OR = 3.9, p<0.001 compared to Mbeya), fever in the
previous two weeks (OR = 1.7, p<0.001) and belonging to older age groups (OR =
1.2, p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: The most significant predictors identified were expected. History of 
fever in the past two weeks and young age were significant predictors of LF/DLF
in the blood, which is encouraging. Antimalarial drug pressure was high and hence
the use of recommended first-line drugs in combination with malaria Rapid
Diagnostics Tests should be promoted to ensure appropriate treatment.

BACKGROUND: Malaria remains one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality
among under-five (U5) children in Nigeria. Though different environmental factors
have been assessed to influence the distribution and transmission of malaria
vectors, there is a dearth of information on how housing type may influence
malaria transmission among U5 children in Nigeria. This study assessed the
relationship between housing type and malaria prevalence among U5s in Nigeria.
METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis of the nationally representative 2015 Nigeria
malaria indicator survey data was done. A representative sample of 8148
households in 329 clusters was selected for the survey. Children aged 6-59 months
in the selected households were tested for anaemia and malaria using the rapid
diagnostic test (RDT) and the microscopy. Data were analysed using descriptive
statistics, Pearson Chi square (χ2) and logistic regression models at 5% level of
significance.
RESULTS: The odds of malaria infection was significantly higher among older
children aged 24-59 months (aOR = 4.8, CI 2.13-10.99, p < 0.001), and children
who lived in houses built completely with unimproved materials (aOR = 1.4, CI
1.08-1.80, p = 0.01). Other predictors of malaria infection include living in a
rural area (aOR = 1.5, CI 1.25-1.91, p = 0.01), ever slept under a long-lasting
insecticide-treated net (aOR = 1.1, CI 0.26-4.79, p = 0.89) and in a room not
sprayed with insecticide (aOR = 1.2, CI 0.64-2.31, p = 0.56). Children who were
malaria positive showed a higher prevalence of severe anaemia on RDT (87.6%) and 
Microscopy (67.4%) than those who were not anaemic (RDT = 31.6%,
Microscopy = 12.9%).
CONCLUSIONS: Non-improved housing predicted malaria infection among U5s in
Nigeria. Improved housing is a promising means to support a more integrated and
sustainable approach to malaria prevention. Education of the Nigerian people on
the role of improved housing on malaria protection and empowerment of the public 
to adopt improved housing as well as overall enlightenment on ways to prevent
malaria infection can help to augment the current malaria control measures among 
U5 children.

BACKGROUND: Indonesia introduced single screening and treatment (SST) of pregnant
women for the control of malaria in pregnancy in 2012. Under this policy pregnant
women are screened for malaria at their first antenatal clinic (ANC) visit and on
subsequent visits are tested for malaria only if symptomatic. The implementation 
of this policy in two districts of Indonesia was evaluated. Cross sectional
survey structured observations of the ANC visit and exit interviews with pregnant
women were conducted to assess health provider compliance with SST guidelines.
Systems effectiveness analysis was performed on components of the strategy.
Multiple logistic regression was used to test for predictors of women being
screened at their first ANC visit.
RESULTS: A total of 865 and 895 ANC visits in Mimika and West Sumba across seven 
and ten health facilities (plus managed health posts) respectively, were included
in the study. Adherence to malaria screening at first ANC visit among pregnant
women was 51.4% (95% CI 11.9, 89.2) in health facilities in Mimika (94.8% in
health centres) and 24.8% (95% CI 10.3, 48.9) in West Sumba (60.0% in health
centres). Reported fever was low amongst women presenting for their second and
above ANC visit (2.8% in Mimika and 3.5% in West Sumba) with 89.5% and 46.2% of
these women tested for malaria in Mimka and West Sumba, respectively. Cumulative 
systems effectiveness for SST on first visit to ANC was 7.6% for Mimika and 0.1% 
for West Sumba; and for second or above visits to ANC was 0.7% in Mimika and 0%
in West Sumba. Being screened on a 1st visit to ANC was associated with level of 
health facility in both sites.
CONCLUSION: Cumulative systems effectiveness of the SST strategy was poor in both
sites. Both elements of the SST strategy, screening on first visit and passive
case detection on second and above visits, was driven by the difference in
implementation of malaria testing in health centres and health posts, and by low 
malaria transmission levels and reported fever.

BACKGROUND: In Ethiopia, malaria has declined in the last decade; only a small
number of cases have been reported, primarily from hotspots. The contribution of 
house proximity to water bodies and the role of migration in malaria transmission
has not yet been examined in detail in northwest Ethiopia. Individual and
household-level environmental and socio-demographic drivers of malaria
heterogeneity were explored contextually in meso-endemic villages around Lake
Tana, northwest Ethiopia.
METHODS: A health facility-based paired age-sex matched case-control study
involving 303 matched pairs was undertaken from 10 October 2016, to 30 June 2017.
Geo-referencing of case households, control households, proximate water bodies,
and health centres was carried out. A pretested and structured questionnaire was 
used to collect data on socio-demography, household assets, housing, travel
history, and malaria intervention measures. Medians (interquartile range) were
computed for continuous variables. Pearson's Chi square/Fisher's exact test was
used to detect significant differences in proportions. Principal component
analysis was performed to estimate household wealth. Stratified analysis was used
to confirm confounding and interaction. A multivariable conditional logistic
regression model was used to detect risk factors for malaria.
RESULTS: Of 303 malaria cases, 59 (19.5% [15.4-24.3]) were imported malaria cases
whereas 244 (80.5% [75.7-84.6]) were locally acquired malaria cases. In bivariate
analysis, marital status, educational status, and bed net ownership were
significantly associated with malaria cases. In multivariable adjustment, travel 
to malarious lowlands in the preceding month (adjusted mOR = 7.32; 95% CI
2.40-22.34), household member's travel to malarious lowlands (adjusted
mOR = 2.75; 95% CI 1.02-7.44), and inadequate health information on malaria
(adjusted mOR = 1.57; 95% CI 1.03-2.41) were predictors of malaria. Stratified
analysis confirmed that elevation of households and travel to malarious lowlands 
were not effect modifiers. Travel to malarious lowlands had a confounding effect 
on malaria but elevation of households did not.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, travel to farms in the lowlands and inadequate health
information on malaria were risk factors for malaria in villages around Lake
Tana. This evidence is critical for the design of improved strategic
interventions that consider imported malaria cases and approaches for accessing
health information on malaria control in northwest Ethiopia.

Heterogeneity in malaria risk is considered a challenge for malaria elimination. 
A cross-sectional study was conducted to describe and explain
micro-epidemiological variation in Plasmodium infection prevalence at household
and village level in three villages in Ratanakiri Province, Cambodia. A two-level
logistic regression model with a random intercept fitted for each household was
used to model the odds of Plasmodium infection, with sequential adjustment for
individual-level then household-level risk factors. Individual-level risk factors
for Plasmodium infection included hammock net use and frequency of evening
outdoor farm gatherings in adults, and older age in children. Household-level
risk factors included house wall material, crop types, and satellite dish and
farm machine ownership. Individual-level risk factors did not explain differences
in odds of Plasmodium infection between households or between villages. In
contrast, once household-level risk factors were taken into account, there was no
significant difference in odds of Plasmodium infection between households and
between villages. This study shows the importance of ongoing indoor and
peridomestic transmission in a region where forest workers and mobile populations
have previously been the focus of attention. Interventions targeting malaria risk
at household level should be further explored.

BACKGROUND: Malaria remains endemic in Nigeria despite programmes and policies
put in place toward malaria elimination. Long-lasting insecticidal nets have been
documented to offer protection from malaria by preventing mosquito bites. While
many studies have examined the factors associated with the use of bed nets in
Nigeria and across Africa, little information is available on the factors
associated with consistency of use of bed nets.
METHODS: The data for this study were derived from a household survey conducted
in three states in Nigeria (Akwa Ibom, Kebbi and Nasarawa) between July and
September 2015 by the Health Communication Capacity Collaborative, a 5-year
cooperative agreement supported by the United States Agency for International
Development and the US President's Malaria initiative and led by the Johns
Hopkins Center for Communication Programs. The analysis was limited to a total of
3884 men and women selected from 2863 households with at least one bed net.
Multilevel multinomial logistic regression was used to assess the factors
associated with consistency of use of bed nets.
RESULTS: The findings revealed 43.2% of the respondents use bed nets every night,
while 38.4% use bed nets most nights. The factors associated with using a bed net
every night rather than rarely or never using a bed net included sociodemographic
and household variables (age, gender, religion, household size, net density, and 
household wealth), ideational variables (perceptions about severity,
susceptibility, self-efficacy to use nets, and response-efficacy of bed net;
awareness of place of purchase; willingness to pay for bed nets; attitudes
towards net use; and descriptive norm about nets), and state of residence. The
three study states differ significantly in terms of most of the independent
variables included in the estimated model.
CONCLUSIONS: The study recommends that efforts designed to promote consistent use
of bed nets should be state-specific and include strategies targeting ideational 
variables. Furthermore, given the significance of unmeasured heterogeneity at the
cluster level, strategies to engage and mobilize the community, such as community
dialogue, home visits and engaging community leadership, are relevant.

BACKGROUND: Severe falciparum malaria can be compounded by bacterial sepsis,
necessitating antibiotics in addition to anti-malarial treatment. The objective
of this analysis was to develop a prognostic model to identify patients admitted 
with severe malaria at higher risk of developing bacterial sepsis.
METHODS: A retrospective data analysis using trial data from the South East Asian
Quinine Artesunate Malaria Trial. Variables correlating with development of
clinically defined sepsis were identified by univariable analysis, and
subsequently included into a multivariable logistic regression model. Internal
validation was performed by bootstrapping. Discrimination and goodness-of-fit
were assessed using the area under the curve (AUC) and a calibration plot,
respectively.
RESULTS: Of the 1187 adults with severe malaria, 86 (7.3%) developed clinical
sepsis during admission. Predictors for developing sepsis were: female sex, high 
blood urea nitrogen, high plasma anion gap, respiratory distress, shock on
admission, high parasitaemia, coma and jaundice. The AUC of the model was 0.789, 
signifying modest differentiation for identifying patients developing sepsis. The
model was well-calibrated (Hosmer-Lemeshow Chi squared = 1.02). The 25th
percentile of the distribution of risk scores among those who developed sepsis
could identify a high-risk group with a sensitivity and specificity of 70.0 and
69.4%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed model identifies patients with severe malaria at risk
of developing clinical sepsis, potentially benefiting from antibiotic treatment
in addition to anti-malarials. The model will need further evaluation with more
strictly defined bacterial sepsis as outcome measure.

Introduction: Malaria is the commonest cause of morbidity and mortality among
displaced populations especially children in endemic countries. Nigeria, an
endemic country, has had increase in internally displaced persons (IDP) due to
insurgency. utilization of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN) is a key
strategy employed to achieve global targets of malaria elimination and its
effectiveness is determined by utilization, coverage and maintenance. We
determined the coverage and utilization of LLIN among children aged 6-59 months
at IDP camps and its predictors.
Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among children aged 6-59 months at
the three IDP camps in Abuja. We collected data on socio-demographic
characteristics, LLIN ownership and utilization using computer-aided interview,
complemented by direct observation of nets. We defined universal LLIN coverage as
the proportion of households with one LLIN to two persons and utilization as an
eligible child sleeping under the LLIN the night preceeding the survey. Bivariate
analysis was done at p < 0.25 and logistic regression at 5% level of
significance.
Results: Overall, 393 children were enrolled with mean age of 33.3 ± 17.4 months,
51.6% were female. Household LLIN ownership was 76.7.5%, universal coverage 11.2%
and utilization 89.7%. Independent predictors of LLIN utilization were LLIN hung 
at sleeping area (adjusted OR: 99.9, CI: 22.7 - 438.8) and type of camp site
(adjusted OR: 8.2, CI: 2.5 - 27.4).
Conclusion: LLIN utilization was high in these IDP camps despite low coverage.
LLIN distribution and hanging campaigns are recommended to reduce malaria
transmission in the IDP camps.

Background: Malaria is a febrile illness caused by protozoan parasites of the
genus Plasmodium. It is prevalent in tropical and subtropical countries and
becomes a challenge to a highly endemic area of Africa including Ethiopia. The
West Armachiho district is a malaria-endemic lowland area where communities are
experiencing hyperendemic malaria transmission.
Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of malaria and
the associated risk factors among asymptomatic migrant laborers in the West
Armachiho district, Northwest Ethiopia.
Materials and methods: Community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from
September to December 2016 on 385 migrant laborers selected by proportionate
two-stage sampling method in Agricultural camps of the West Armachiho district. A
standardized questionnaire was used to collect sociodemographic data and risk
factors. Capillary blood was collected for Giemsa-stained blood film examination 
to detect and identify Plasmodium parasites. Data were coded, entered, checked
for completeness, and analyzed using SPSS version-20 statistical software.
Multivariate logistic regression was used to asses significantly associated risk 
factors. A P-value <0.05 was considered as statistically significant.
Results: The prevalence of malaria was found to be 18.4% (n=71). Education level,
home area or origin of migrant laborers, number of visits, outdoor sleeping, and 
bed net utilization were associated with the risk of malaria (P<0.05).
Conclusion: Malaria was high in this study area and associated with outdoor
sleeping, number of visits, home area, and bed net utilization.

Background: Anemia affects a significant part of the population in nearly every
country in the globe. Iron requirements are greatest at ages 6-23 months when
growth is extremely rapid and critically essential in critical times of life.
Even though infants and toddlers are highly at risk, they are not considered as
separate populations in the estimation of anemia. Despite this, the prevalence of
anemia among under 24 months of age is still at its highest point of severity to 
be a public health problem in Ethiopia. There is no study that documented the
magnitude of the problem and associated factors in the study area. The main aim
of this study was to assess the prevalence of anemia and to identify associated
factors among children 6-23 months of age.
Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was carried out among 485
children of Damot Sore, South Ethiopia from March to April 2017. Data on
socio-demographic, dietary, blood samples for hemoglobin level and malaria
infection were collected. Both descriptive and bivariate analyses were done and
all variables having a p-value of 0.25 were selected for multivariable analyses. 
A multivariable logistic regression model was used to isolate independent
predictors of anemia at a p-value less than 0.05. A principal component analysis 
was used to generate household wealth score, dietary diversity score.
Results: Out of 522 sampled children, complete data were captured from 485 giving
a response rate of 92.91%. For altitude and persons smoking in the house adjusted
prevalence of anemia was 255(52.6%). The larger proportion, 128(26.4%) of
children had moderate anemia. On multivariable logistic regression analyses,
household food insecurity (AOR = 2.74(95% CI: 1.62-4.65)), poor dietary diversity
(AOR = 2.86(95% CI: 1.73-4.7)), early or late initiation of complementary feeding
(AOR = 2.0(95% CI: 1.23-3.60)), poor breastfeeding practice (AOR = 2.6(95% CI:
1.41-4.62)), and poor utilization of folic acid by mothers (AOR = 2.75(95% CI:
1.42-5.36)) were significantly associated with anemia.
Conclusion: Prevalence of anemia among children (6-23 months) was a severe public
health problem in the study area. Most important predictors are suboptimal child 
feeding practices, household food insecurity, and poor diet. Multi-sectoral
efforts are needed to improve health and interventions targeting nutrition
security are recommended.

BACKGROUND: Border malaria, a shared phenomenon in the Greater Mekong Sub-region 
of Southeast Asia, is a major obstacle for regional malaria elimination. Along
the China-Myanmar border, an additional problem arose as a result of the
settlement of internally displaced people (IDP) in the border region. Since
asymptomatic malaria significantly impacts transmission dynamics, assessment of
the prevalence, dynamics and risk factors of asymptomatic malaria infections is
necessary.
METHODS: Cross-sectional surveys were carried out in 3 seasons (March and April, 
July and November) and 2 sites (villages and IDP camps) in 2015. A total of 1680 
finger-prick blood samples were collected and used for parasite detection by
microscopy and nested RT-PCR (nRT-PCR). Logistic regression models were used to
explore the risk factors associated with asymptomatic malaria at individual and
household levels.
RESULTS: The prevalence of asymptomatic Plasmodium infections was 23.3% by
nRT-PCR, significantly higher than that detected by microscopy (1.5%). The
proportions of Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium falciparum and mixed-species
infections were 89.6, 8.1 and 2.3%, respectively. Asymptomatic infections showed 
obvious seasonality with higher prevalence in the rainy season. Logistic
regression analysis identified males and school children (≤ 15 years) as the
high-risk populations. Vector-based interventions, including bed net and indoor
residual spray, were found to have significant impacts on asymptomatic Plasmodium
infections, with non-users of these measures carrying much higher risks of
infection. In addition, individuals living in poorly constructed households or
farther away from clinics were more prone to asymptomatic infections.
CONCLUSIONS: Sub-microscopic Plasmodium infections were highly prevalent in the
border human populations from IDP camps and surrounding villages. Both
individual- and household-level risk factors were identified, which provides
useful information for identifying the high-priority populations to implement
targeted malaria control.

BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of recent prospective data on the incidence of
postpartum infections and associated risk factors in sub-Saharan Africa.
Retrospective studies estimate that puerperal sepsis causes approximately 10% of 
maternal deaths in Africa.
METHODS: We enrolled 4231 women presenting to a Ugandan regional referral
hospital for delivery or postpartum care into a prospective cohort and measured
vital signs postpartum. Women developing fever (> 38.0 °C) or hypothermia
(< 36.0 °C) underwent symptom questionnaire, structured physical exam, malaria
testing, blood, and urine cultures. Demographic, treatment, and post-discharge
outcomes data were collected from febrile/hypothermic women and a random sample
of 1708 normothermic women. The primary outcome was in-hospital postpartum
infection. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine factors
independently associated with postpartum fever/hypothermia and with confirmed
infection.
RESULTS: Overall, 4176/4231 (99%) had ≥1 temperature measured and 205/4231 (5%)
were febrile or hypothermic. An additional 1708 normothermic women were randomly 
selected for additional data collection, for a total sample size of 1913
participants, 1730 (90%) of whom had complete data. The mean age was 25 years,
214 (12%) were HIV-infected, 874 (51%) delivered by cesarean and 662 (38%) were
primigravidae. Among febrile/hypothermic participants, 174/205 (85%) underwent
full clinical and microbiological evaluation for infection, and an additional 24 
(12%) had a partial evaluation. Overall, 84/4231 (2%) of participants met
criteria for one or more in-hospital postpartum infections. Endometritis was the 
most common, identified in 76/193 (39%) of women evaluated clinically.
Twenty-five of 175 (14%) participants with urinalysis and urine culture results
met criteria for urinary tract infection. Bloodstream infection was diagnosed in 
5/185 (3%) participants with blood culture results. Another 5/186 (3%) tested
positive for malaria. Cesarean delivery was independently associated with
incident, in-hospital postpartum infection (aOR 3.9, 95% CI 1.5-10.3, P = 0.006),
while antenatal clinic attendance was associated with reduced odds (aOR 0.4, 95% 
CI 0.2-0.9, P = 0.02). There was no difference in in-hospital maternal deaths
between the febrile/hypothermic (1, 0.5%) and normothermic groups (0, P = 0.11).
CONCLUSIONS: Among rural Ugandan women, postpartum infection incidence was low
overall, and cesarean delivery was independently associated with postpartum
infection while antenatal clinic attendance was protective.

Iron deficiency (ID) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection frequently 
coexist. Little data exist on ID in HIV-infected individuals, partly because the 
iron marker ferritin is altered by inflammation common in HIV infection. We
measured iron biomarkers (ferritin, soluble transferrin receptor [sTfR],
hepcidin) and red cell indices (hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume [MCV]) in
newly diagnosed, antiretroviral therapy-naive, HIV-infected (N = 138) and
uninfected (N = 52) Kenyan adults enrolled in a study of the immune response to
malaria. We compared markers between infected and uninfected groups with t test
and Wilcoxon Rank-Sum, used Spearman correlation to determine the association
between iron and inflammatory markers, and applied logistic regression to
determine which markers best predicted anemia. HIV-infected individuals had lower
hemoglobin (P < 0.001), lower MCV (P < 0.001), higher sTfR (P = 0.003), and a
greater prevalence of ID (sTfR > 8.3 mg/L) than uninfected individuals. Ferritin 
was elevated in HIV-infected individuals and was more strongly correlated with
C-reactive protein (ρ = 0.43, P < 0.001) and hepcidin (ρ = 0.69, P < 0.001) than 
with hemoglobin. The best predictor of anemia in HIV-infected participants was
sTfR, with a one log-unit increase in sTfR associated with a 6-fold increase in
the odds of anemia (odds ratio = 6.3, 95% confidence interval: 1.8-21.8). These
data suggest a significant burden of ID among treatment-naive HIV-infected Kenyan
adults. Soluble transferrin receptor may be a reliable marker of ID in
HIV-mediated inflammation.

Introduction: The burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) is increasing in low
and middle-income countries (LMIC). According to the World Health Organization
(WHO) the largest increase occurs in Africa. Obesity, diabetes mellitus and
hypertension (ODH) are major risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, causing
nearly 18 million deaths worldwide. Various risks associated with mining as an
occupational activity are implicated in NCDs' occurrence. This study describes
the baseline prevalence of ODH and associated risk factors in the workforce of
Tenke Fungurume Mining (TFM), in southern Democratic Republic of Congo.
Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on a sample of 2,749 employees'
and contractor's occupational health examination files for 2010.
Socio-demographic, occupational, medical, anthropometric and behavioral
characteristics were collected and assessed. Disease status regards ODH was based
on WHO criteria. A multivariate logistic regression model was used.
Results: Overall prevalence of ODH was 4.5%, 11.7%, and 18.2% respectively.
Proportions of pre-ODH individuals were 19.7%, 16.5%, and 47.8% respectively.
Prevalence of ODH increased with age, professional grade, nature of work, gender 
and reported alcohol use. Smoking 10 or more cigarettes per day increased risk of
diabetes and hypertension, while decreasing obesity.
Conclusion: Rates of ODH and associated risk factors are higher in the TFM
workforce, than in the general DRC population. This is likely reflective of other
mining sites in the country and region. It is evident that ODH are associated
with various socio-demographic, occupational, anthropometric, biomedical and
behavioral risk factors. A NCD prevention program and close monitoring of disease
and risk factors trends are needed in this population.

BACKGROUND: A marked decline in malaria morbidity and mortality has been reported
after the introduction of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) in high
malaria prevalence countries in Africa. Data on the impact of ACT and on the
prevalence of malaria has so far been scarce for Southwest Tanzania.
METHODS: Between 2005 and 2011, a large general population cohort in the Mbeya
Region in the south-west of Tanzania has been surveyed within the EMINI-study
(Evaluation and Monitoring of the Impact of New Interventions). Participants were
examined once per year, including rapid diagnostic testing for malaria. ACT was
introduced in the region according to national guidelines in the time period
2006/2007, replacing sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine as first-line therapy. In four
study sites, 6773 individuals who participated in the first two of three
consecutive survey visits in the period from 2006 to 2009 were included in this
analysis. The prevalence of Plasmodium infection prior to and after the
introduction of ACT was compared by logistic regression, with consideration of
climatic variability, age, sex, socio-economic status and bed net use as
potential confounders.
RESULTS: A significant reduction over time in the prevalence of Plasmodium
falciparum infection from 2.5 to 0.3% was shown across the four study sites. The 
decline was not explained by other factors included in the analysis, therefore,
the decline over time most likely reflects the impact of introduction of ACT in
the study area.
CONCLUSIONS: The longitudinal study showed a significant and relevant decline in 
the prevalence of P. falciparum infection after introduction of ACT, which could 
not be explained by potential confounders. The data suggests that
artemisinin-based combinations are not only an effective instrument for reduction
of immediate morbidity and mortality, but also for reduction of transmission
rates.

BACKGROUND: Taenia solium cysticercosis, recognized as a neglected tropical
disease by the WHO, is distributed mostly in developing countries of Latin
America, sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. Pigs and humans act as intermediate hosts, 
acquiring T. solium cysticerci (larval stage) in their tissue, through the
ingestion of T. solium eggs shed in the faeces of humans infected with adult
tapeworms. The disease has a negative impact on rural economies due to losses in 
productivity arising from human disease, pork carcass condemnations and loss of
market access. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of T. solium 
cysticercosis in pigs in Dak Lak Province in the Central Highlands of Vietnam and
to identify household level characteristics associated with T. solium porcine
cysticercosis.
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of household pigs in three districts of
Dak Lak Province. A total of 408 households in six villages in three districts
were visited between June and October 2015. A questionnaire was administered to
the head of each household, and within each household, serum samples were
collected from three pigs. Serum samples were analyzed using the recombinant T24H
antigen in enzyme-linked immunoelectrotransfer blot assay and lentil lectin
purified glycoprotein in EITB assay. A Bayesian, mixed-effects logistic
regression model was developed to identify management factors associated with the
probability of a household having at least one cysticercosis-positive pig.
RESULTS: The prevalence of porcine T. solium cysticercosis in this study was low 
at 0.94 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51-1.68] cases per 100 pigs at risk, in
agreement with other studies conducted throughout Vietnam. Scavenging of food and
coprophagy were associated with T. solium cysticercosis [odds ratios 1.98 (95%
CrI: 0.55-4.74) and 2.57 (95% CrI: 1.22-4.66), respectively].
CONCLUSIONS: This study proves that the seroprevalence of porcine cysticercosis
in Dak Lak Province was as low as that of other studies conducted throughout
Vietnam. Scavenging of food and coprophagy are modifiable factors, providing the 
opportunity to decrease the prevalence of porcine cysticercosis further in the
province.

BACKGROUND: Utilization of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN) has been
associated with reduction of malaria incidence, especially among children. The
2013 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey revealed Osun State had the least
proportion (5.7%) of under-five children (U5) who slept under LLIN the night
before the survey. A study was conducted to assess caregivers' knowledge about
LLIN, utilization of LLIN and factors influencing LLIN use among U5 in Osun
State, Nigeria.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out among 1020 mothers/caregivers of
U5 selected from six communities in Osun State using a multistage sampling
technique. A pre-tested interviewer administered questionnaire was used to
collect information on socio-demographic characteristics, mothers' knowledge
about LLIN, ownership and utilization of LLIN and factors influencing use of LLIN
in U5. Questions on knowledge about LLIN were scored and categorized into good
(scored ≥ 5) and poor (score < 5) knowledge out of a maximum obtainable score of 
seven. Utilization of LLIN was defined as the proportion of U5 who slept under
net the night before the survey. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics,
Chi square test and logistic regression at α < 0.05. Transcripts from focus group
discussions (FGD) were analysed for emerging themes related to caregivers'
perspectives on utilization and factors affecting use of LLIN among U5.
RESULTS: Majority of the respondents 588 (58.3%) fall between age 25-34 years,
with a mean age of 30.0 ± 6.3 years. All were aware of LLIN but only 76.1% had
good knowledge and 59.0% reported use of LLIN among their U5. Reported barriers
to utilizing LLIN were; heat (96.4%), reactions to the chemical (75.5%) and
unpleasant odour (41.3%). These were corroborated at FGD. Those with formal
education [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.4; 95% CI 1.0-2.1] and those with good
knowledge of LLIN (aOR = 1.8; 95% CI 1.4-2.5) were more likely to use LLIN than
their counterparts without formal education and those with poor knowledge of LLIN
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The level of knowledge of respondents about LLIN was high and the
utilization of LLIN among U5 was above average, however, it is still far below
the 80% target. Efforts should be made to further improve utilization of LLIN
through intensified promotion and health education.

BACKGROUND: Malaria case management in the context of the 2014-2016 West African 
Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic was complicated by a similar initial clinical 
presentation of the two diseases. In September 2014, the World Health
Organization (WHO) released recommendations titled, "Guidance on temporary
malaria control measures in Ebola-affected countries", which aimed at reducing
the risk of EVD transmission and improving malaria outcomes. This guidance
recommended malaria diagnostic testing of fever cases only if adequate personal
protective equipment (PPE) was available, defined as examination gloves, face
shield, disposable gown, boots, and head cover; otherwise presumptive
anti-malarial treatment was recommended. The extent to which health workers
adhered to these guidelines in affected countries has not been assessed.
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 118 health units in Guinea in 
November 2014 to produce a representative and probabilistic sample of health
facilities and patients. Adherence to the EVD-specific malaria case management
guidelines during the height of the EVD epidemic was assessed. Associations
between case management practices and possible determinants were calculated using
multivariate logistic regression, controlling for expected confounders and the
complex sample design.
RESULTS: Most (78%) facilities reported availability of examination gloves, but
adequate PPE was available at only 27% of facilities. Only 28% of febrile
patients received correct malaria case management per the WHO temporary malaria
case management guidelines. The most common error was diagnostic testing in the
absence of adequate PPE (45% of febrile patients), followed by no presumptive
treatment in the absence of adequate PPE (14%). Having had a report of an EVD
case at a health facility and health worker-reported participation in
EVD-specific malaria trainings were associated with lower odds of diagnostic
testing and higher odds of presumptive treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to guidance on malaria case management in EVD-affected
countries was low at the height of the EVD epidemic in Guinea, and there was
substantial malaria diagnostic testing in the absence of adequate PPE, which
could have contributed to increased EVD transmission in the healthcare setting.
Conversely, low presumptive treatment when diagnostic tests were not performed
may have led to additional morbidity and mortality among malaria positive
patients. National malaria control programs may consider preparing contingency
plans for future implementation of temporary changes to malaria case management
guidelines to facilitate uptake by health workers. Additional training on
standard and transmission-based precautions should help health workers understand
how to protect themselves in the face of emerging and unknown pathogens.

In 2005, Nigeria changed its antimalarial drug policy to Artemisinin-based
Combination Therapies (ACTs) for the treatment of malaria infection, and it is
imperative for prescribers to strictly comply with this guideline to harmonize
malaria management practices within the country. This study aims to evaluate
prescribers' adherence with the National Antimalarial Treatment Guideline (NATG) 
in the treatment of malaria infections and to describe the determinants of
antimalarial drugs coprescription with antibiotics at a tertiary hospital in
Nigeria. A cross-sectional, retrospective study of antimalarial drug
prescriptions of one-year period of 2013 was conducted. A simple method for
assessing the quality of drug prescribing (DU90%) was adopted. Logistic
regression was used to predict antimalarial drugs coprescription with
antibiotics. Overall, 95.8% of the total prescriptions contained ACTs, out of
which 80.8% were Artemether/Lumefantrine. However, adherence to NATG was 88.2%
with an adjusted value of 100.0%. Age was the only predictor for antimalarial
drugs coprescription with antibiotics. This study showed high concordance with
NATG at the studied hospital. Age less than 5 years is a significant risk factor 
for antimalarial drugs coprescription with antibiotics.

Though literature suggests a positive association between use of biomass fuel for
cooking and inflammation, few studies among women in rural South Africa exist. We
included 415 women from the South African Study of Women and Babies (SOWB),
recruited from 2010 to 2011. We obtained demographics, general medical history
and usual source of cooking fuel (wood, electricity) via baseline questionnaire. 
A nurse obtained height, weight, blood pressure, and blood samples. We measured
plasma concentrations of a suite of inflammatory markers (e.g., interleukins,
tumor necrosis factor-α, C-reactive protein). We assessed associations between
cooking fuel and biomarkers of inflammation and respiratory symptoms/illness
using crude and adjusted linear and logistic regression models. We found little
evidence of an association between fuel-use and biomarkers of inflammation,
pre-hypertension/hypertension, or respiratory illnesses. Though imprecise, we
found 41% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.72-2.77) higher odds of self-reported
wheezing/chest tightness among wood-users compared with electricity-users. Though
studies among other populations report positive findings between biomass fuel use
and inflammation, it is possible that women in the present study experience lower
exposures to household air pollution given the cleaner burning nature of wood
compared with other biomass fuels (e.g., coal, dung).

BACKGROUND: Four university medical training institutions in Uganda have trained 
students at off-site health facilities under community-based education and
Research Service (COBERS) programme for over 5 years. One of the major components
of COBERS placement is for the students to provide health education in the
communities about malaria as a major public health disease in Uganda. This study 
seeks to assess if targeted community-based medical education programme is
associated with better prevention and treatment seeking behaviours in the
management of malaria, a leading cause of morbidity and mortality of children
under five in Uganda.
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was done to compare communities around health
facilities where medical students were placed at COBERS sites with communities
around similar health facilities where medical students were not placed
(non-COBERS sites). We randomly selected two villages near each health facility
and consecutively selected 10 households per village for interviews using
nearest-neighbour method. We used a structured questionnaire to interview
household heads on malaria prevention and treatment seeking behaviour for
children under 5 years. We performed univariate analysis to determine site and
demographic characteristics and performed a multivariate logistic regression to
assess association between dependant and independent variables.
RESULTS: Five hundred twenty-three (66.8%) of the children under 5 years in
COBERS communities slept under Insecticide Treated Nets (ITNs) the night before
survey compared with 1451 (57.8%) in non-COBERS communities (AOR = 0.66,
p = 0.017). 100 (60.0%) of children under 5 years in COBERS communities sought
care for fever within 24 h of onset compared with 268 (47.0%) in non-COBERS
communities (AOR = 0.71, P = 0.009).
CONCLUSION: The presence of COBERS in communities is associated with improved
malaria prevention and treatment-seeking behaviour for parents of children under 
5 years. Further study needs to be done to determine the long-term impact of
COBERS training program on malaria control and prevention in Uganda, along with
other effects of COBERS.

BACKGROUND: Reliable, population-based data on pregnancy-related morbidity and
mortality, and risk factors for fatal foetal outcomes are scarce for low- and
middle-income countries. Yet, such data are essential for understanding and
improving maternal and neonatal health and wellbeing.
METHODS: Within the 4-monthly surveillance rounds of the Taabo health and
demographic surveillance system (HDSS) in south-central Côte d'Ivoire, all women 
of reproductive age identified to be pregnant between 2011 and 2014 were
followed-up. A questionnaire pertaining to antenatal care, pregnancy-related
morbidities, delivery circumstances, and birth outcome was administered to
eligible women. Along with sociodemographic information retrieved from the Taabo 
HDSS repository, these data were subjected to penalized maximum likelihood
logistic regression analysis, to determine risk factors for fatal foetal
outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 2976 pregnancies were monitored of which 118 (4.0%) resulted 
in a fatal outcome. Risk factors identified by multivariable logistic regression 
analysis included sociodemographic factors of the expectant mother, such as
residency in a rural area (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 2.87; 95% confidence
interval (CI) 1.31-6.29) and poorest wealth tertile (aOR = 1.79; 95% CI
1.02-3.14), a history of miscarriage (aOR = 23.19; 95% CI 14.71-36.55),
non-receipt of preventive treatment such as iron/folic acid supplementation
(aOR = 3.15; 95% CI 1.71-5.80), only two doses of tetanus vaccination
(aOR = 2.59; 95% CI 1.56-4.30), malaria during pregnancy (aOR = 1.94; 95% CI
1.21-3.11), preterm birth (aOR = 4.45; 95% CI 2.82-7.01), and delivery by
caesarean section (aOR = 13.03; 95% CI 4.24-40.08) or by instrumental delivery
(aOR = 5.05; 95% CI 1.50-16.96). Women who paid for delivery were at a
significantly lower odds of a fatal foetal outcome (aOR = 0.39; 95% CI
0.25-0.74).
CONCLUSIONS: We identified risk factors for fatal foetal outcomes in a mainly
rural HDSS site of Côte d'Ivoire. Our findings call for public health action to
improve access to, and use of, quality services of ante- and perinatal care.

BACKGROUND: The transmission of malaria through population inflows from highly
endemic areas with limited control efforts poses major challenges for national
malaria control programmes. Several multilateral programmes have been launched in
recent years to address cross-border transmission. This study assesses the
potential impact of such a programme at the Angolan-Namibian border.
METHODS: Community-based malaria prevention programmes involving bed net
distribution and behaviour change home visits were rolled-out using a controlled,
staggered (stepped wedge) design between May 2014 and July 2016 in a 100 × 40 km 
corridor along the Angolan-Namibian border. Three rounds of survey data were
collected. The primary outcome studied was fever among children under five in the
2 weeks prior to the survey. Multivariable linear and logistic regression models 
were used to assess overall programme impact and the relative impact of
unilateral versus coordinated bilateral intervention programmes.
RESULTS: A total of 3844 child records were analysed. On average, programme
rollout reduced the odds of child fever by 54% (aOR: 0.46, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.73)
over the intervention period. In Namibia, the programme reduced the odds of fever
by 30% in areas without simultaneous Angolan efforts (aOR: 0.70, 95% CI 0.34 to
1.44), and by an additional 62% in areas with simultaneous Angolan programmes. In
Angola, the programme was highly effective in areas within 5 km of Namibian
programmes (OR: 0.37, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.62), but mostly ineffective in areas
closer to inland Angolan areas without concurrent anti-malarial efforts.
CONCLUSIONS: The impact of malaria programmes depends on programme efforts in
surrounding areas with differential control efforts. Coordinated malaria
programming within and across countries will be critical for achieving the vision
of a malaria free world.

BACKGROUND: Lao People Democratic Republic (PDR; Laos), a landlocked country in
Southeast Asia, has made important progress in reducing malaria morbidity and
mortality in the past 5-6 years, and the northern provinces have very low
reported incidence. To support national progress towards elimination, it is
critical to verify and understand these changes in disease burden.
METHODS: A two-stage cluster cross-sectional survey was conducted in four
districts within four northern provinces (Khua, Phongsaly Province; Paktha, Bokeo
Province; Nambak, Luang Prabang, and Muang Et, Huaphanh Province). During
September and October 2016, demographics and malaria risk factors were collected 
from a total of 1492 households. A total of 5085 persons consented to collection 
of blood samples for testing, by rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and polymerase chain
reaction (PCR)-based testing. Risk factors for infection were examined using
logistic regression; and a randomized subset of males was tested for
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiencies using a combined PCR and
sequencing approach.
RESULTS: There were zero positives by RDT, and PCR detected Plasmodium infections
in 39 (0.77%; 95% CI 0.40-1.47%) of 5082 analysable samples. The species
distribution was Plasmodium vivax (28 total); Plasmodium falciparum/P. vivax (5);
P. falciparum (3), Plasmodium malariae (2), and P. vivax/P. malariae (1). In
multivariable analysis, the main risk factors included having any other cases
within the household [aOR 12.83 (95% CI 4.40 to 37.38), p < 0.001]; and lack of
bed net ownership within the household [aOR 10.91 (95% 5.42-21.94), p < 0.001];
age, sex and forest-travel were not associated with parasitaemia. A total of 910 
males were tested for the six most common G6PDd in SE Asia; and 30 (3.3%; 95% CI 
2.1-5.1%) had a G6PD variant allele associated with G6PD deficiency, with the
majority being the Union (14) and Viangchan (11) polymorphisms, with smaller
numbers of Canton and Mahidol.
CONCLUSION: This is the first rigorous PCR-based population survey for malaria
infection in Northern Lao PDR, and found a very low prevalence of asymptomatic
Plasmodium infections by standard PCR methods, with P. vivax predominating in the
surveyed districts. Clustering of cases within households, and lack of a bed nets
suggest reactive case detection, and scale-up of coverage should be prioritized. 
The predominance of infections with P. vivax, combined with moderate levels of
serious G6PD deficiencies highlight the need for careful rollout of primaquine
towards elimination goals.

BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of knowledge concerning erythrocytes in the
aetiology of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) despite their potential to contribute to
disease through impaired antioxidant capacity and altered haemorheological
features. Several studies have identified an abundance of erythrocyte miRNAs and 
variable profiles associated with disease states, such as sickle cell disease and
malaria. The aim of this study was to compare the erythrocyte miRNA profile of
relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients to healthy sex- and age-matched controls.
METHODS: Erythrocytes were purified by density-gradient centrifugation and RNA
was extracted. Following library preparation, samples were run on a HiSeq4000
Illumina instrument (paired-end 100 bp sequencing). Sequenced erythrocyte miRNA
profiles (9 patients and 9 controls) were analysed by DESeq2. Differentially
expressed miRNAs were validated by RT-qPCR using miR-152-3p as an endogenous
control and replicated in a larger cohort (20 patients and 18 controls). After
logarithmic transformation, differential expression was determined by two-tailed 
unpaired t-tests. Logistic regression analysis was carried out and receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to determine biomarker
potential.
RESULTS: A total of 236 erythrocyte miRNAs were identified. Of twelve
differentially expressed miRNAs in RRMS two showed increased expression (adj.
p < 0.05). Only modest fold-changes were evident across differentially expressed 
miRNAs. RT-qPCR confirmed differential expression of miR-30b-5p (0.61 fold,
p < 0.05) and miR-3200-3p (0.36 fold, p < 0.01) in RRMS compared to healthy
controls. Relative expression of miR-3200-5p (0.66 fold, NS p = 0.096) also
approached significance. MiR-3200-5p was positively correlated with cognition
measured by audio-recorded cognitive screen (r = 0.60; p < 0.01). MiR-3200-3p
showed greatest biomarker potential as a single miRNA (accuracy = 75.5%,
p < 0.01, sensitivity = 72.7%, specificity = 84.0%). Combining miR-3200-3p,
miR-3200-5p, and miR-30b-5p into a composite biomarker increased accuracy to
83.0% (p < 0.05), sensitivity to 77.3%, and specificity to 88.0%.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to report differences in erythrocyte miRNAs 
in RRMS. While the role of miRNAs in erythrocytes remains to be elucidated,
differential expression of erythrocyte miRNAs may be exploited as biomarkers and 
their potential contribution to MS pathology and cognition should be further
investigated.

BACKGROUND: A large body of research has investigated the rise of injection drug 
use and HIV transmission in Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez (CJ). However, little is
known about the dynamics of injecting in Hermosillo. This study compares
drug-related behaviors and risk environment for HIV of people who inject drugs
(PWID) across Tijuana, CJ, and Hermosillo to identify factors that could explain 
differences in HIV prevalence.
METHODS: Data from Tijuana belong to a prospective study (El Cuete IV). Data from
Hermosillo and Ciudad Juarez belong to a cross-sectional study. Both studies
collected data in places where PWID spend time. All participants completed
quantitative behavioral and serological testing for HIV. Datasets were merged
using only comparable variables. Descriptive statistics tests were used to
compare sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics of people who inject
drugs PWID sampled in each city. A logistic regression model was built to
identify factors independently associated with the likelihood of reporting
receptive syringe sharing in the past 6 months.
RESULTS: A total of 1494 PWID provided data between March 2011 and May 2012. HIV 
prevalence differed significantly between participants in Tijuana (4.2%), CJ
(7.7%), and Hermosillo (5.2%; p < 0.05). PWID from Hermosillo reported better
living conditions, less frequency of drug injection, and lower prevalence of
syringe sharing (p < 0.01). PWID from CJ reported a higher prevalence of syringe 
sharing and confiscation by police (p < 0.01). In a multivariable logistic
regression model, living in Hermosillo compared to Tijuana (adjusted odds ratio
[AOR] = 0.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.29-0.61) and being female
(AOR = 0.61, 95% CI 0.45-0.83) were protective against syringe sharing. Having
used crystal meth (AOR = 1.62, 95% CI 1.24-2.13, p = 0.001), having experienced
syringe confiscation by police in the last 6 months (AOR = 1.78, 95% CI
1.34-2.40), and lower perception of syringe availability (AOR = 2.15, 95% CI
1.59-2.91) were significantly associated with syringe sharing (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Differences in HIV prevalence across cities reflect mainly
differences in risk environments experienced by PWID, shaped by police practices,
access to injection equipment, and dynamics of drug markets. Findings highlight
the importance of ensuring sterile syringe availability through harm reduction
services and a human rights approach to drug harms in northern Mexico and to
generate better understanding of local dynamics and contexts of drug use for
designing proper harm reduction programs.

BACKGROUND: After the introduction of an artemisinin-based combination therapy,
the reduction of prevalence of malaria infections has shown a remarkable progress
during the last decade. However due to the lack of a consistent malaria control
programme and socioeconomic inequalities, Plasmodium infection is still one of
the major cause of disease in Equatorial Guinea, namely in the rural communities.
This study explored the associated risk factors of malaria transmission at the
microeconomic level (households) in two rural villages of mainland Equatorial
Guinea.
METHODS: This survey involved 232 individuals living in 69 households located in 
two rural villages, Ngonamanga and Miyobo, of coastal and interior of Equatorial 
Guinea, respectively. Malaria prevalence was measured by PCR and parasitaemia
level by optical microscopy; household socioeconomic status (SES) was measured
based on house characteristics using a 2-step cluster analysis. Logistic
regression analysis was performed to investigate the relationship of a diverse
set of independent variables on being diagnosed with malaria and on showing high 
levels of parasitaemia.
RESULTS: The prevalence of Plasmodium spp. infection was 69%, with 80% of
households having at least one parasitaemic member. The majority of houses have
eaves (80%), walls of clay/wood (90%) and zinc roof (99%) and only 10% of them
have basic sanitation facilities. The studied areas showed reduced rates of
indoor residual spraying coverage (9%), and long-lasting insecticide-treated net 
ownership (35%), with none of these preventive tools showing any significant
effects on malaria risk in these areas. Neither the risk of malaria infection
(PCR positive result) or the development of high parasitaemia did show
association with SES.
CONCLUSIONS: This study has contributed to reinforce the importance of living
conditions associated to a high risk of malaria infection and vulnerability to
develop high parasitaemia. This study also contributes to future malaria control 
interventions to be implemented in mainland Equatorial Guinea or in other
countries with similar environmental conditions.

Introduction: For every woman who dies during pregnancy and childbirth, many more
suffer ill-health, the burden of which is highest in low-resource settings. We
sought to assess the extent and types of maternal morbidity.
Methods: Descriptive observational cross-sectional study at primary-level and
secondary-level healthcare facilities in India, Pakistan, Kenya and Malawi to
assess physical, psychological and social morbidity during and after pregnancy.
Sociodemographic factors, education, socioeconomic status (SES), quality of life,
satisfaction with health, reported symptoms, clinical examination and laboratory 
investigations were assessed. Relationships between morbidity and maternal
characteristics were investigated using multivariable logistic regression
analysis.
Results: 11 454 women were assessed in India (2099), Malawi (2923), Kenya (3145),
and Pakistan (3287). Almost 3 out of 4 women had ≥1 symptoms (73.5%),
abnormalities on clinical examination (71.3%) or laboratory investigation
(73.5%). In total, 36% of women had infectious morbidity of which 9.0% had an
identified infectious disease (HIV, malaria, syphilis, chest infection or
tuberculosis) and an additional 32.5% had signs of early infection. HIV-positive 
status was highest in Malawi (14.5%) as was malaria (10.4%). Overall, 47.9% of
women were anaemic, 11.5% had other medical or obstetric conditions, 25.1%
reported psychological morbidity and 36.6% reported social morbidity (domestic
violence and/or substance misuse). Infectious morbidity was highest in Malawi
(56.5%) and Kenya (40.4%), psychological and social morbidity was highest in
Pakistan (47.3%, 60.2%). Maternal morbidity was not limited to a core at-risk
group; only 1.2% had all four morbidities. The likelihood of medical or
obstetric, psychological or social morbidity decreased with increased education; 
adjusted OR (95% CI) for each additional level of education ranged from 0.79
(0.75 to 0.83) for psychological morbidity to 0.91 (0.87 to 0.95) for infectious 
morbidity. Each additional level of SES was associated with increased
psychological morbidity (OR 1.15 (95% CI 1.10 to 1.21)) and social morbidity (OR 
1.05 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.10)), but there was no difference regarding medical or
obstetric morbidity. However, for each morbidity association was heterogeneous
between countries.
Conclusion: Women suffer significant ill-health which is still largely
unrecognised. Current antenatal and postnatal care packages require adaptation if
they are to meet the identified health needs of women.

BACKGROUND: Several malaria endemic countries have implemented community health
worker (CHW) programmes to increase access to populations underserved by health
care. There is considerable evidence on CHW adherence to case management
guidelines, however, there is limited evidence on the compliance to referral
advice and the outcomes of children under-5 referred by CHWs. This analysis
examined whether caregivers complied with CHWs referral advice.
METHODS: Data from two cluster (village) randomised trials, one in a
moderate-to-high malaria transmission setting, another in a low-transmission
setting conducted between January 2010-July 2011 were analysed. CHW were trained 
to recognise signs and symptoms that required referral to a health centre. CHW in
the intervention arm also had training on; malaria rapid diagnostic tests (mRDT) 
and administering artemisinin based combination therapy (ACT); CHW in the control
arm were trained to treat malaria with ACTs based on fever symptoms. Caregivers' 
referral forms were linked with CHW treatment forms to determine whether
caregivers complied with the referral advice. Factors associated with compliance 
were examined with logistic regression.
RESULTS: CHW saw 18,497 child visits in the moderate-to-high transmission setting
and referred 15.2% (2815/18,497) of all visits; in the low-transmission setting, 
35.0% (1135/3223) of all visits were referred. Compliance to referral was low, in
both settings < 10% of caregivers complied with referral advice. In the
moderate-to-high transmission setting compliance was higher if children were
tested with mRDT compared to children who were not tested with mRDT. In both
settings, nearly all children treated with pre-referral rectal artesunate failed 
to comply with referral and compliance was independently associated with factors 
such as health centre distance and day of referral by a CHW. In the
moderate-to-high transmission setting, time of presentation, severity of referral
were also associated with compliance, whilst in the low-transmission setting,
compliance was low if an ACT was prescribed.
CONCLUSIONS: This analysis suggests there are several barriers to comply with
CHWs referral advice by caregivers. This is concerning for children who received 
rectal artesunate. As CHW programmes continue scale-up, barriers to referral
compliance need to be addressed to ensure a continuum of care from the community 
to the health centre.

BACKGROUND: School children in developing countries like Nigeria are faced with
numerous nutrition and health problems. Lack of functional school health and
nutrition programmes in Enugu state, Nigeria may be associated with dearth of
data on associated factors. Identifying these factors could inform the design and
implementation of school-based programmes aimed at ameliorating these problems.
METHODS: A cross sectional survey involving 450 primary and secondary school
children aged 6-15 years was conducted in Ede-Oballa, a rural community in Enugu 
state, South-eastern Nigeria. Selection of the pupils was by multistage sampling 
technique. Data were collected through interviewer administered questionnaire,
anthropometric measurements of weight and height, 3-day weighed food intake,
stool microscopy and blood analyses for malaria, zinc and vitamin A. Bivariate
and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate associations 
of interest with significance accepted at P < 0.05.
RESULTS: The school children were affected by underweight (18.2%), stunting
(41.6%), thinness (20.0%), zinc (43.3%) and vitamin A (51.1%) deficiencies. After
adjusting for potential confounders, weekly food expenditure was a major
predictor of under-weight (AOR = 0.19, 95% CI: 0.08, 0.46), stunting (AOR = 0.36,
95% CI: 0.13, 0.95) and thinness (AOR = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.30, 0.80); household
income was also a predictor of thinness (AOR = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.25, 0.88). Males
had lower odds of being stunted than females (AOR = 0.31, 95% CI: 0.11, 0.83).
The odd of being underweight was higher in female headed households than in
households headed by males (AOR = 0.30, 95% CI: 0.12, 0.75). Tapeworm was an
independent predictor of vitamin A (AOR = 3.59; 95% CI: 1.06, 12.13) and zinc
(AOR = 3.64; 95% CI: 1.02, 12.98) deficiencies. Children with whipworm were more 
likely to be zinc (AOR = 3.80; 95% CI: 1.11, 13.04) and vitamin A (AOR = 3.79;
95% CI: 1.12, 12.89) deficient than those uninfected.
CONCLUSION: Underweight, stunting, thinness, vitamin A and zinc deficiency among 
the school children were functions of weekly food expenditure, gender of
household head and household income, tapeworm, whipworm, and sex. These findings 
emphasize the need for effective school- and community-based interventions.

Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes develop over 9-12 days while sequestered in
deep tissues. On emergence into the bloodstream, they circulate for varied
amounts of time during which certain host factors might influence their further
development. We aimed to evaluate the potential association of patient clinical
parameters with gametocyte development and carriage via in vivo methods.
Seventy-two patients were enrolled from three hospitals in the Volta region of
Ghana in 2016. Clinical parameters were documented for all patients, and
gametocyte prevalence by microscopy was estimated at 12.5%. By measuring RNA
transcripts representing two distinct gametocyte developmental stages using
reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), we
obtained a more precise estimate of gametocyte carriage while also inferring
gametocyte maturation. Fifty-three percent of the study participants harbored
parasites expressing transcripts of the immature gametocyte-specific gene
(PF3D7_1477700), whereas 36% harbored PF3D7_1438800 RNA-positive parasites, which
is enriched in mid and mature gametocytes, suggesting the presence of more
immature stages. Linear logistic regression showed that patients older than 5
years but less than 16 years were more likely to carry gametocytes expressing
both PF3D7_1477700 and PF3D7_1438800 compared with younger participants, and
gametocytemia was more likely in mildly anemic individuals compared with those
with severe/moderate anemia. These data provide further evidence that a greater
number of malaria patients harbor gametocytes than typically estimated by
microscopy and suggest a possible association between age, fever, anemia, and
gametocytemia.

BACKGROUND: Malaria in pregnancy causes adverse birth outcomes. Intermittent
preventive treatment of malaria during pregnancy with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine 
(IPTp-SP) is recommended as a chemoprevention therapy. Zomba district IPTp uptake
falls far below the national average. The study was conducted to assess
determinants of IPTp-SP uptake during pregnancy among postpartum women in Zomba
district after adoption of new IPTp-SP policy in 2014.
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional survey. Two public health facilities (HFs)
were randomly selected from urban and rural areas in Zomba district. Study
participants were postpartum women selected by using exit poll method from HFs. A
total of 463 postpartum women were interviewed using structured questionnaire.
Bivariate and multiple logistic regression was used in data analysis.
RESULTS: Out of all the enrolled participants (n = 463), 92% women had complete
information for analysis. Of these, (n = 426) women, 127 (29.8%, 95% CI:
25.6%-34.3%) received three or more doses of SP, 299 (70.2%, 95% CI: 65.7%-74.4%)
received two or less doses. Women receiving SP from rural HF were less likely to 
get at least three doses of SP than urban women, (AOR = 0.31, 95% CI 0.13-0.70); 
Others less likely were those with three or few antenatal care (ANC) visits
versus four or more visits (AOR = 0.29, 95% CI 0.18-0.48); not taking SP under
direct observation therapy (DOT) (AOR = 0.18, 95% CI (0.05-0.63).
CONCLUSIONS: There is low utilisation of at least three doses of SP in this
population and this seems to be associated with the number of ANC visits and use 
of DOTs. These determinants may therefore be important in shaping interventions
aimed at increasing the uptake of IPTp in this district. In addition, the rural
urban differential suggests the need for further research to understand the
barriers and enablers of uptake in each context in order to improve the health of
the community.

BACKGROUND: Despite the progress in reducing malaria infections and related
deaths, the disease remains a major global public health problem. The problem is 
among the top five leading causes of outpatient visits in Dembia district of the 
northwest Ethiopia. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the determinants of
malaria infections in the district.
METHODS: An institution-based case-control study was conducted in Dembia district
from October to November 2016. Out of the ten health centers in the district,
four were randomly selected for the study in which 370 participants (185 cases
and 185 controls) were enrolled. Data were collected using a pretested structured
questionnaire. Factors associated with malaria infections were determined using
logistic regression analysis. Odds ratio with 95% CI was used as a measure of
association, and variables with a p-value of ≤0.05 were considered as
statistically significant.
RESULTS: The median age of all participants was 26 years, while that of cases and
controls was 22 and 30 with a range of 1 to 80 and 2 to 71, respectively. In the 
multivariable logistic regression, over 15 years of age adjusted odds ratio(AOR) 
and confidence interval (CI) of (AOR = 18; 95% CI: 2.1, 161.5), being male
(AOR = 2.2; 95% CI: 1.2, 3.9), outdoor activities at night (AOR = 5.7; 95% CI:
2.5, 12.7), bed net sharing (AOR = 3.9; 95% CI: 2.0, 7.7), and proximity to
stagnant water sources (AOR = 2.7; 95% CI: 1.3, 5.4) were independent predictors.
CONCLUSION: Being in over 15 years of age group, male gender, night time
activity, bed net sharing and proximity to stagnant water sources were
determinant factors of malaria infection in Dembia district. Additional
interventions and strategies which focus on men, outdoor work at night, household
net utilization, and nearby stagnant water sources are essential to reduce
malaria infections in the area.

and Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda.

Background: Initiation of specific antimalarial treatment within 24 hrs of fever 
onset at home and before presentation to the hospital is one of the strategies to
reduce mortality from malaria in sub-Saharan Africa. In order to determine
whether this strategy is being implemented we describe the use and factors
associated with the use of pre-hospital medications among children admitted with 
malaria in one of the tertiary hospitals in Uganda.
Materials and methods: Use of pre-hospital medications was assessed in 205
children aged 6-59 months and diagnosed with malaria at admission in Mulago
hospital. Data were obtained on the type, source, and dose adequacy of medicines 
used before presentation to the hospital as well as the socio-demographical
characteristics of the children. The proportion of children using pre-hospital
medication was determined and logistic regression analysis used to determine
factors associated with use of pre-hospital medication.
Results: Overall, 147/205 (72%) of the children were given some medication for
their illness before presentation to the hospital. The common pre-hospital
medicines used were paracetamol (107/147, 72.8 %) and antimalarial medicines
(91/147, 61.9 %). Antibiotics were used in only 12 (8.2 %) of the cases. The
majority (62/91, 68%) of the cases got medicines from a health facility but only 
41/91 (45%) received an adequate dose. Having fever for more than three days was 
significantly associated with use of pre-hospital medicines (OR = 2.2; 95% CI
1.12-4.35; p = 0.02).
Conclusions: The pre-hospital use of medicines is common amongst children
presenting with malaria to this tertiary Ugandan hospital. The practice is,
however, associated with use of inadequate doses of antimalarials and delay in
presentation to the hospital. More effort is therefore needed to educate
communities on the importance of proper home management of malaria.

OBJECTIVE: Existing information has shown that infants who are prenatally exposed
to P. falciparum are susceptible to subsequent malaria infections. However, the
effect of prenatal exposure to P. falciparum on parasite density during clinical 
malaria episodes has not been fully elucidated. This study is a component of a
prospective cohort study for which initial results have been published. This
component was designed to determine the effect of prenatal exposure to P.
falciparum on parasite density during clinical malaria episodes in the first
24 months of life. A total of 215 infants were involved and monitored for
clinical malaria episodes defined by fever (≥ 37 °C) and parasitaemia. The
geometric mean parasite counts between exposed and unexposed infants were
compared using independent samples t test. The effect of in utero exposure to P. 
falciparum on parasite density was assessed using binary logistic regression.
RESULTS: The geometric mean parasite count per µl of blood during clinical
malaria episodes in exposed infants was 24,889 (95% CI 18,286-31,490) while in
unexposed infants it was 14,035 (95% CI 12,111-15,960), P < 0.05. Prenatal
exposure to P. falciparum was associated with hyperparasitaemia during clinical
malaria episodes (OR 7.04, 95% CI 2.31-21.74), while other factors were not
significantly associated (P > 0.05).

BACKGROUND: With an increasing burden of non-communicable disease in Nepal and
limited progress towards universal health coverage, country- and disease-specific
estimates of financial hardship related to healthcare costs need to be evaluated 
to protect the population effectively from healthcare-related financial burden.
OBJECTIVES: To estimate the cost and economic burden of illness and to assess the
inequality in the financial burden due to catastrophic health expenditure from
1995 to 2010 in Nepal.
METHODS: This study used nationally representative Nepal Living Standards Surveys
conducted in 1995 and 2010. A Bayesian two-stage hurdle model was used to
estimate average cost of illness and Bayesian logistic regression models were
used to estimate the disease-specific incidence of catastrophic health payment
and impoverishment. The concentration curve and index were estimated by disease
category to examine inequality in healthcare-related financial hardship.
FINDINGS: Inflation-adjusted mean out-of-pocket (OOP) payments for chronic
illness and injury increased by 4.6% and 7.3%, respectively, while the cost of
recent acute illness declined by 1.5% between 1995 and 2010. Injury showed the
highest incidence of catastrophic expenditure (30.7% in 1995 and 22.4% in 2010)
followed by chronic illness (12.0% in 1995 and 9.6% in 2010) and recent acute
illness (21.1% in 1995 and 7.8% in 2010). Asthma, diabetes, heart conditions,
malaria, jaundice and parasitic illnesses showed increased catastrophic health
expenditure over time. Impoverishment due to injury declined most (by 12% change 
in average annual rate) followed by recent acute illness (9.7%) and chronic
illness (9.6%) in 15 years. Inequality analysis indicated that poorer populations
with recent acute illness suffered more catastrophic health expenditure in both
sample years, while wealthier households with injury and chronic illnesses
suffered more catastrophic health expenditure in 2010.
CONCLUSION: To minimize the economic burden of illness, several approaches need
to be adopted, including social health insurance complemented with an upgraded
community-based health insurance system, subsidy program expansion for diseases
with high economic burden and third party liability motor insurance to reduce the
economic burden of injury.

Malaria outbreaks have been reported in recent years in the Colombian Amazon
region, malaria has been re-emerging in areas where it was previously controlled.
Information from malaria transmission networks and knowledge about the population
characteristics influencing the dispersal of parasite species is limited. This
study aimed to determine the distribution patterns of Plasmodium vivax, P.
malariae and P. falciparum single and mixed infections, as well as the
significant socio-spatial groupings relating to the appearance of such
infections. An active search in 57 localities resulted in 2,106 symptomatic
patients being enrolled. Parasitaemia levels were assessed by optical microscopy,
and parasites were detected by PCR. The association between mixed infections (in 
43.2% of the population) and socio-spatial factors was modelled using logistic
regression and multiple correspondence analyses. P. vivax occurred most
frequently (71.0%), followed by P. malariae (43.2%), in all localities. The
results suggest that a parasite density-dependent regulation model (with fever
playing a central role) was appropriate for modelling the frequency of mixed
species infections in this population. This study highlights the under-reporting 
of Plasmodium spp. mixed infections in the malaria-endemic area of the Colombian 
Amazon region and the association between causative and environmental factors in 
such areas.

Livestock ownership may influence anaemia through complex and possibly
contradictory mechanisms. In this study, we aimed to determine the association of
household livestock ownership with anaemia among women aged 15-49 years and
children aged 6-59 months in Ghana and to examine the contribution of animal
source foods (ASFs) to consumption patterns as a potential mechanism mediating
this association. We analysed data on 4,441 women and 2,735 children from the
2014 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey and 16,772 households from the Ghana
Living Standards Survey Round 6. Haemoglobin measurements were used to define
anaemia (non-pregnant women: <120 g/L; children: <110 g/L). Child- and
household-level ASF consumption data were collected from 24-hour food group
intake and food consumption and expenditure surveys, respectively. In multiple
logistic regression models, household livestock ownership was associated with
anaemia among children (OR, 95% CI: 1.5 [1.1, 2.0]), but not women (1.0 [0.83,
1.2]). Household ownership of chickens was associated with higher odds of anaemia
among children (1.6 [1.2, 2.2]), but ownership of other animal species was not
associated with anaemia among women or children. In path analyses, we observed no
evidence of mediation of the association of household livestock ownership with
child anaemia by ASF consumption. Ownership of livestock likely has limited
importance for consumption of ASFs among young children in Ghana and may in fact 
place children at an increased risk of anaemia. Further research is needed to
elucidate if and how pathogen exposure associated with livestock rearing may
underlie this increased risk of anaemia.

BACKGROUND: Cerebral malaria (CM) causes a rapidly developing coma, and remains a
major contributor to morbidity and mortality in malaria-endemic regions. This
study sought to determine the relationship between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
Plasmodium falciparum histidine rich protein-2 (PfHRP-2) and clinical, laboratory
and radiographic features in a cohort of children with retinopathy-positive CM.
METHODS: Patients included in the study were admitted (2009-2013) to the
Pediatric Research Ward (Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital, Blantyre, Malawi)
meeting World Health Organization criteria for CM with findings of malarial
retinopathy. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine plasma and
CSF PfHRP-2 levels. Wilcoxon rank-sum tests and multivariable logistic regression
analysis assessed the association of clinical and radiographic characteristics
with the primary outcome of death during hospitalization.
RESULTS: In this cohort of 94 patients, median age was 44 (interquartile range
29-62) months, 53 (56.4%) patients were male, 6 (7%) were HIV-infected, and 10
(11%) died during hospitalization. Elevated concentrations of plasma lactate
(p = 0.005) and CSF PfHRP-2 (p = 0.04) were significantly associated with death. 
On multivariable analysis, higher PfHRP-2 in the CSF was associated with death
(odds ratio 9.00, 95% confidence interval 1.44-56.42) while plasma PfHRP-2 was
not (odds ratio 2.05, 95% confidence interval 0.45-9.35).
CONCLUSIONS: Elevation of CSF, but not plasma PfHRP-2, is associated with death
in this paediatric CM cohort. PfHRP-2 egress into the CSF may represent
alteration of blood brain barrier permeability related to the sequestration of
parasitized erythrocytes in the cerebral microvasculature.

Background: Malaria is of global health concern particularly among pregnant
women. Nigeria contributes largely to global burden but coverage of Intermittent 
Preventive Treatment of malaria in pregnancy using Sulphadoxine pyrimethamine
remains low. This study was conducted to determine the national situation of
missed opportunity for IPTp-SP and attempted to look at correlates and
predictors.
Method: The study used secondary data analysis of the Nigeria Demographic Health 
Survey, 2013. Data on socio-demographics, ANC characteristics and IPTp-SP use
during pregnancy among 6,910 women aged 15-49 years who delivered in the last two
years with at least 4 ANC visits were analyzed. Missed opportunity for IPTp
delivery was defined as an ANC visit where IPTp was not delivered as per the
policy. Data was analyzed using SPSS version 21. Associations used Chi-square
test and significant variables were fit into multi-variate logistic regression
model. All analyses were performed at 5% level of significance.
Results: National prevalence for missed opportunity for IPTp-SP was high (73.4%).
Predictors of missed opportunity are being of poorer, middle and richer wealth
index (OR=0.737, CI 0.566-0.960); (OR=0.659, CI 0.521-0.833); (OR=0.686, CI
0.550-0.857), residence in South East OR=0.549, CI (0.415-0.726) and in the North
West (OR=0.176, CI 0.133-0.232). Other predictors are having a primary and
secondary education and presenting for the first ANC visit in the second
trimester OR=0.739, p=0.024, CI (0.569-0.961).
Conclusion: Missed opportunity for IPTp-SP was high. The need for stronger
governmental commitment to upscale uptake of IPTp-SP by incorporating the
knowledge of socio-economic, cultural and demographic barriers to accessing IPTp 
is paramount.

BACKGROUND: In Vietnam, malaria persists in remote forested regions where
infections are spatially heterogeneous, mostly asymptomatic and with low parasite
density. Previous studies in Vietnam have investigated broad behavioural concepts
such as 'engaging in forest activities' as risk factors for malaria infection,
which may not explain heterogeneity in malaria risk, especially in malaria
elimination settings.
METHODS: A mixed methods study combining ethnographic research and a
cross-sectional survey was embedded in a 1-year malariometric cohort study in
three ethnic minority villages in South Tra My district, Quang Nam Province in
Central Vietnam. Qualitative data collection included in-depth interviews,
informal conversations and participant observations over a 2-month period, and
the findings were used to develop the questionnaire used in the cross-sectional
survey. The latter collected data on evening activities, mobility patterns and
household characteristics. The primary outcome, recent exposure to malaria, was
defined using the classification and regression tree method to determine
significant changes in antibody titres during the year preceding the survey. Risk
factor analyses for recent exposure to malaria were conducted using logistic
regression.
RESULTS: 22 in-depth interviews and numerous participant observations were
recorded during the ethnographic research (April to June 2015), and 160 adults
(86% response rate) responded to the cross-sectional survey (November to December
2015). Recent exposure to Plasmodium falciparum malaria was estimated at 22.9 and
at 17.1% for Plasmodium vivax. Ongoing malaria transmission appears to be
maintained by activities that delay or disrupt sleeping in a permanent structure 
in which a bed net could be hung, including evening drinking gatherings, fishing,
logging in the forest and outdoor TV watching.
CONCLUSIONS: Vector control tools for outdoor evening activities in villages as
well as at farms, forest and river locations should be incorporated into current 
malaria elimination efforts in Central Vietnam. Micro-epidemiology studies using 
mixed-methods designs can provide a comprehensive understanding of the malaria
risk at fine spatial scales and better inform the implementation of targeted
interventions for malaria elimination.

In low-endemic areas for malaria transmission, asymptomatic individuals play an
important role as reservoirs for malarial infection. Understanding the dynamics
of asymptomatic malaria is crucial for its efficient control in these regions.
Genetic host factors such as Toll-like receptor (TLR) polymorphisms may play a
role in the maintenance or elimination of infection. In this study, the effect of
TLR polymorphisms on the susceptibility to malaria was investigated among
individuals living in the Atlantic Forest of São Paulo, Southern Brazil. A
hundred and ninety-five Brazilian individuals were enrolled and actively followed
up for malaria for three years. Twenty-four polymorphisms in five toll-like
receptor (TLR) genes were genotyped by RFLP, direct sequencing or fragment
analysis. The genotypes were analyzed for the risk of malaria. Ongoing Plasmodium
vivax or P. malariae infection, was identified by the positive results in PCR
tests and previous P. vivax malaria, was assumed when antiplasmodial antibodies
against PvMSP119 were detected by ELISA. An evaluation of genomic ancestry was
conducted using biallelic ancestry informative markers and the results were used 
as correction in the statistical analysis. Nine SNPs and one microsatellite were 
found polymorphic and three variant alleles in TLR genes were associated to
malaria susceptibility. The regression coefficient estimated for SNP
TLR9.-1237.T/C indicated that the presence of at least one allele C increased, on
average, 2.3 times the malaria odds, compared to individuals with no allele C in 
this SNP. However, for individuals with the same sex, age and household, the
presence of at least one allele C in SNP TLR9.-1486.T/C reduced, on average, 1.9 
times the malaria odds, compared to individuals with no allele C. Moreover, this 
allele C plus an S allele in TLR6.P249S in individuals with same sex, age and
ancestry, reduced, on average, 4.4 times the malaria odds. Our findings indicate 
a significant association of TLR9.-1237.T/C gene polymorphism with malarial
infection and contribute to a better knowledge of the role of TLRs in malaria
susceptibility in an epidemiological setting different from other settings.

Objective To investigate the capabilities of Plasmodium microscopic examinations 
of professional staff in medical institutions in Wuxi City, so as to provide
evidences for improving malaria control and elimination work in the future.
Methods The data of questionnaires for laboratorial staff in charge of Plasmodium
microscopic examinations were collected and analyzed in the medical institutions 
in Wuxi City in 2016, and the influencing factors related to the capabilities of 
Plasmodium microscopic examinations were analyzed by the method of logistic
regression. Results Totally 54 laboratorial workers in 54 medical institutions in
Wuxi City were investigated, 16 of them were male, and 38 were female, and the
ratio of male to female was 0.42:1. Among the 54 laboratorial workers, 12 persons
(22.22%) had the experience of detecting Plasmodium in the work. The
multivariable analysis showed the ability to detect Plasmodium was associated
with male laboratorial workers (adjusted OR = 0.11, 95%CI:0.02-0.53),
laboratorial workers with intermediate or higher professional titles (adjusted OR
= 5.31, 95%CI: 1.04-27.19) and laboratorial workers from county and township
medical institutions (adjusted OR = 0.04, 95%CI:0.01-0.98). Conclusions All of
the medical institutions in Wuxi City have the capability of microscopic
examinations of Plasmodium. However, the ability of laboratorial staff in primary
hospitals still should be improved.

BACKGROUND: Spatio-temporal variations in malaria burden are currently complex
and costly to measure, but are important for decision-making. We measured the
spatio-temporal variation of clinical malaria incidence at a fine scale in a
cohort of children under five in an endemic area in rural Chikhwawa, Malawi,
determined associated factors, and monitored adult mosquito abundance.
METHODS: We followed-up 285 children aged 6-48 months with recorded geolocations,
who were sampled in a rolling malaria indicator survey, for one year (2015-2016).
Guardians were requested to take the children to a nearby health facility
whenever ill, where health facility personnel were trained to record malaria test
results and temperature on the child's sick-visit card; artemisinin-based
combination therapy was provided if indicated. The cards were collected and
replaced 2-monthly. Adult mosquitoes were collected from 2-monthly household
surveys using a Suna trap. The head/thorax of adult Anopheles females were tested
for presence of Plasmodium DNA. Binomial logistic regression and geospatial
modelling were performed to determine predictors of and to spatially predict
clinical malaria incidence, respectively.
RESULTS: Two hundred eighty two children, with complete results, and 267.8
child-years follow-up time were included in the analysis. The incidence rate of
clinical malaria was 1.2 cases per child-year at risk; 57.1% of the children had 
at least one clinical malaria case during follow-up. Geographical groups of
households where children experienced repeated malaria infections overlapped with
high mosquito densities and high entomological inoculation rate locations.
CONCLUSIONS: Repeated malaria infections within household groups account for the 
majority of cases and signify uneven distribution of malaria risk within a small 
geographical area.

Introduction: Primaquine is vital for the management of liver-stage Plasmodium
vivax and Plasmodium ovale malaria. However, primaquine effectiveness is
dependent on various factors and differs between populations. Therefore, this
study was conducted to identify factors that affect the length of stay and
relapse during primaquine combination treatment in malaria-infected patients in
the local setting.
Materials and Methods: A retrospective study on the use of primaquine combination
among P. vivax and P. ovale infected patients in Selangor, Malaysia within a
5-year period from 2011 to 2015 was obtained from the National Malaria Case
Registry, Malaysia. Data collected were patient characteristics (age, gender,
nationality, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, pregnancy); disease
characteristics (survival, past malaria infection, parasite type, presence of
gametocyte, parasite count, week onset, severity, transmission type); and
treatment characteristics (type of antimalarial, treatment completion). Outcome
measures were length of stay and relapse during a 1-year follow-up.
Results: A total of 635 patients were included in the study. Based on a
multivariate logistic regression analysis, the significant predictors for length 
of stay were gender (P = 0.009) and indigenous transmission (P < 0.001). Male
patients had a shorter length of stay than females by 0.868 days (P = 0.009), and
indigenous transmission took 1.82 days more compared to nonindigenous
transmission (P < 0.001). Predictors for relapse were indigenous transmission of 
malaria (P = 0.019), which was 15.83 times more likely to relapse than
nonindigenous transmission (P < 0.01).
Conclusions: This study reveals that the effectiveness of primaquine was
clinically associated with gender and indigenous transmission. To that end,
vigilant monitoring of primaquine use is required to reduce relapse and future
transmission.

University, Wolaita-Sodo, Ethiopia.

Background: Malaria can be prevented using cost-effective interventions. It can
be prevented at large via the use of insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITNs).
The use of ITNs decreases malaria mortality rates by 55% in under-5 years old
children in Africa, Ethiopia, realizing the effectiveness, scaling up
distribution and utilization of ITNs to cover 100% of children less than 5 years 
of age. However, little is known about ITNs utilization and factors associated
with the utilization in under-5 years old children in the study area yet. The
purpose of this study was to assess the level and associated factors of ITNs
utilization in under-5 years old children among households with under-5 years old
children of Mirab Abaya District, Gamo Gofa Zone, Ethiopia.
Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted during
August-September, 2016. Six study Kebeles were identified by simple random
sampling technique and 398 households with at least one under-5 years old
children were selected by random sampling technique using computer generated
random numbers from health post family folders. Structured, interviewer
questionnaire was administered to mothers or care givers of the children. Data
were entered to Epi Info Version 3.5 and analyzed in SPSS version 21 statistical 
software. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was done.
P-value <0.05 and odds ratio with 95% confidence interval were used for the
determination of associations between dependent and predictor variables. Results 
were presented in narrations, tables, and graph.
Result: Among 398 under-5 years old children assessed, the majority, 362 (91.0%) 
of them had access to ITN, but only 137 (37.2%) of the child had ITNs utilization
during the previous night prior to the survey. Households with age of mothers or 
caretakers 31-44 years, AOR = 0.03, 95% CI (0.01-0.07) and ≥45 years of age;
AOR = 0.05, 95% CI (0.01-0.58); households with family size ≤5 members,
AOR = 11.23, 95% CI (4.31-29.24); and households with sleeping space ≥2,
AOR = 13.59, 95% CI (4.40-41.93) were found to be significantly associated with
under-5 years old children ITNs utilization.
Conclusion: Even though, a significant proportions of under-5 years old children 
had access to ITN, only one-third of the participant child utilized it properly.

Liver dysfunction has long been recognized as a clinical feature of malaria. We
have observed delayed elevation in the transaminase portion of liver function
tests (LFTs) after treatment in some participants undergoing induced blood stage 
malaria infection. We sought to determine whether similar LFT elevations occur
after naturally acquired infection. We performed a retrospective audit of
confirmed cases of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax in Queensland,
Australia, from 2006 to 2016. All LFT results from malaria diagnosis until 28
days after diagnosis were collected with demographic and clinical information to 
describe longitudinal changes. The timing of peak LFT elevations was classified
as early (0-3 days), delayed (4-11 days), or late (12-28 days) with respect to
the day of diagnosis. Among 861 cases with LFT evaluated, an elevated bilirubin
level was identified in 12.4% (N = 107/861), whereas elevated alanine
transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase levels were observed in 15.1% (N = 
130/861) and 14.8% (N = 127/861) of cases, respectively. All peak bilirubin
results occurred in the early period, whereas ALT elevations were biphasic, with 
elevations in the early and delayed periods, with 35.4% (N = 46/130) of cases
delayed. Univariate and paired stepwise logistic regression analyses were
performed to investigate factors associated with the incidence and timing of
transaminase elevation. A raised ALT level at diagnosis was strongly associated
with the timing of transaminase elevation. No other demographic, parasitic, or
treatment factors were associated. Liver function test abnormalities are likely
an inherent although variable aspect of human malaria, and individual-specific
factors may confer susceptibility to hepatocyte injury.

BACKGROUND: Severe forms of malaria (SM) are an outcome of Plasmodium falciparum 
infection and can cause death especially in children under 4 years of age. RNASE3
(ECP) has been identified as an inhibitor of Plasmodium parasites growth in
vitro, and genetic analysis in hospitalized Ghanaian subjects has revealed the
RNASE3 +371G/C (rs2073342) polymorphism as a susceptibility factor for cerebral
malaria. The +371 C allele results in an Arg/Thr mutation that abolishes the
cytotoxic activity of the ECP protein. The present study aims to investigate
RNASE3 gene polymorphisms and their putative link to severe malaria in a malaria 
cohort from Senegal.
METHODS/RESULTS: Patients enrolled from hospitals were classified as having
either uncomplicated (UM) or severe malaria (SM). The analysis of the RNASE3 gene
polymorphisms was performed in 241 subjects: 178 falciparum infected (96 SM, 82
UM) and 63 non-infected subjects as population control group (CTR). Six frequent 
SNPs (MAF > 3%) were identified, and one SNP was associated with malaria severity
by performing a logistic regression analysis SM vs.UM: RNASE3 +499G/C (rs2233860)
under age, sex as covariates and HbS/HbC polymorphisms adjustment (p = 0.003, OR 
0.43, CI 95% 0.20-0.92). The polymorphisms: +371G/C (rs2073342), +499G/C
(rs2233860) and +577A/T (rs8019343) defined a haplotype risk (G-G-T) for malaria 
severity (Fisher exact test, p = 0.03) (OR 4.1, IC 95% (1.1-14.9).
CONCLUSION: In addition to the previously described association of +371G/C
polymorphism in Ghanaians cohort, the RNASE3 +499G/C polymorphism was associated 
with susceptibility to SM in a Senegalese population. The haplotype
+371G/+499G/+577T defined by RNASE3 polymorphisms was associated with severity.
The genetic association identified independently in the Senegalese population
provide additional evidence of a role of RNASE3 (ECP) in malaria severity.

BACKGROUND: Sustained investments in Rwanda's health system have led to historic 
reductions in under five (U5) mortality. Although Rwanda achieved an estimated
68% decrease in the national under U5 mortality rate between 2002 and 2012,
according to the national census, 5.8% of children still do not reach their fifth
birthday, requiring the next wave of child mortality prevention strategies.
METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study of 9002 births to 6328 women age 15-49
in the 2010 Rwanda Demographic and Health Survey. We tested bivariate
associations between 29 covariates and U5 mortality, retaining covariates with an
odds ratio p < 0.1 for model building. We used manual backward stepwise logistic 
regression to identify correlates of U5 mortality in all children U5,
0-11 months, and 12-59 months. Analyses were performed in Stata v12, adjusting
for complex sample design.
RESULTS: Of 14 covariates associated with U5 mortality in bivariate analysis, the
following remained associated with U5 mortality in multivariate analysis:
household being among the poorest of the poor (OR = 1.98), child being a twin
(OR = 2.40), mother having 3-4 births in the past 5 years (OR = 3.97) compared to
1-2 births, mother being HIV positive (OR = 2.27), and mother not using
contraceptives (OR = 1.37) compared to using a modern method (p < 0.05 for all). 
Mother experiencing physical or sexual violence in the last 12 months was
associated with U5 mortality in children ages 1-4 years (OR = 1.48, p < 0.05). U5
survival was associated with a preceding birth interval 25-50 months (OR = 0.67) 
compared to 9-24 months, and having a mosquito net (OR = 0.46) (p < 0.05 for
both).
CONCLUSIONS: In the past decade, Rwanda rolled out integrated management of
childhood illness, near universal coverage of childhood vaccinations, a national 
community health worker program, and a universal health insurance scheme.
Identifying factors that continue to be associated with childhood mortality
supports determination of which interventions to strengthen to reduce it further.
This study suggests that Rwanda's next wave of U5 mortality reduction should
target programs in improving neonatal outcomes, poverty reduction, family

BACKGROUND: Measuring the quality of hospital admission care is essential to
ensure that standards of practice are met and continuously improved to reduce
morbidity and mortality associated with the illnesses most responsible for
inpatient deaths. The Paediatric Admission Quality of Care (PAQC) score is a tool
for measuring adherence to guidelines for children admitted with acute illnesses 
in a low-income setting. We aimed to explore the external and criterion-related
validity of the PAQC score by investigating its association with mortality using 
data drawn from a diverse sample of Kenyan hospitals.
METHODS: We identified children admitted to Kenyan hospitals for treatment of
malaria, pneumonia, diarrhoea, or dehydration from datasets from three sources:
an observational study, a clinical trial, and a national cross-sectional survey. 
We extracted variables describing the process of care provided to patients at
admission and their eventual outcomes from these data. We applied the PAQC
scoring algorithm to the data to obtain a quality-of-care score for each child.
We assessed external validity of the PAQC score by its systematic replication in 
datasets that had not been previously used to investigate properties of the PAQC 
score. We assessed criterion-related validity by using hierarchical logistic
regression to estimate the association between PAQC score and the outcome of
mortality, adjusting for other factors thought to be predictive of the outcome or
responsible for heterogeneity in quality of care.
FINDINGS: We found 19 065 eligible admissions in the three validation datasets
that covered 27 hospitals, of which 12 969 (68%) were complete cases. Greater
guideline adherence, corresponding to higher PAQC scores, was associated with a
reduction in odds of death across the three datasets, ranging between 9% (odds
ratio 0·91, 95% CI 0·84-0·99; p=0·031) and 30% (0·70, 0·63-0·78; p<0·0001)
adjusted reduction per unit increase in the PAQC score, with a pooled estimate of
17% (0·83, 0·78-0·89; p<0·0001). These findings were consistent with a multiple
imputation analysis that used information from all observations in the combined
dataset.
INTERPRETATION: The PAQC score, designed as an index of the technical quality of 
care for the three commonest causes of admission in children, is also associated 
with mortality. This finding suggests that it could be a meaningful summary
measure of the quality of care for common inpatient conditions and supports a
link between process quality and outcome. It might have potential for application
in low-income countries with similar disease profiles and in which paediatric
practice recommendations are based on WHO guidelines.

Background: Information on the hemoglobin status of pregnant and lactating
mothers was scarce. The objectives of this study were to determine the burden and
determinants of anemia in the pregnant and lactating mother.
Methods: A comparative cross-sectional study was conducted. Descriptive
statistics were used to identify the prevalence of anemia. Binary logistic
regression and multiple linear regressions were used to identify the predictors
of anemia.
Results: The prevalence of anemia in lactating and pregnant women was 43.00% (95%
CI {confidence interval}, 41% - 45%) and 84% of anemia was microcytic and
hypocromic anemia. Anemia in lactating and pregnant women was positively
associated with malaria infection [AOR{adjusted odds ratio} 3.61 (95% CI:
2.63-4.95)], abortion [AOR 6.63 (95% CI: 3.23-13.6)], hookworm infection [AOR
3.37 (95% CI: 2.33-4.88)], tea consumption [AOR 3.63 (95% CI: 2.56-5.14)],
pregnancy [AOR 2.24 (95% CI: 1.57-3.12)], and Mid-upper arm circumference [ B
0.36 (95% CI: 0.33, -0.4)]. Anemia in pregnant and lactating mother was
negatively associated with urban residence [AOR 0.68, (95% CI: 0.5-0.94)], iron
supplementation during pregnancy [AOR 0.03 (95% CI, 0.02-0.04)], parity [ B -0.18
(95% CI: -0.23, -0.14)], age [B -0.03 (95% CI: -0.04, -0.03)].
Conclusion: The burden of anemia was higher in pregnant women than lactating
women.

The Effectiveness of Community Bed Net Use on Malaria Parasitemia among Children 
Less Than 5 Years Old in Liberia.

In 2013, the under-5 mortality rate in Liberia was 71 deaths per 1,000 live
births, with malaria responsible for 22% of those deaths. One of the primary
existing control tools, long-lasting insecticide-treated bed nets (LLINs), is
thought to be dually effective, acting as a physical barrier but also decreasing 
the mosquito population in communities. However, there has been little
investigation into the protective effects of community-wide bed net use above and
beyond the individual level. Using data from the population-representative 2011
Liberia Malaria Indicator Survey, we estimated the association between proportion
of a community using LLINs and malaria in children using multi-level logistic
regression. To investigate the potential effect measure modification of the
relationship by urbanicity, we included an interaction term and calculated
stratum-specific prevalence odds ratios (PORs) for rural and urban communities.
We calculated a POR of malaria for an absolute 10% increase in community bed net 
use of 1.13 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.91, 1.41) and 0.35 (95% CI: 0.13,
0.92) for rural and urban communities, respectively, indicating a strong, though 
imprecise, protective effect within urban communities only. Our results indicate 
that bed net use has an indirect protective effect in urban areas, above and
beyond individual use. Little or no such effect of community-wide use is seen in 
rural areas, likely because of population density factors. Therefore, although
all control efforts should be multifaceted, promotion of bed net use in urban
areas in particular will likely be a highly effective tool for control.

BACKGROUND: Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT), used to treat
uncomplicated malaria cases, is one of the main strategies of malaria control and
elimination. One of the main objectives of the Benin National Malaria Control
Program's (NMCP) strategic plan is to ensure that at least 80% of uncomplicated
malaria is treated with ACT within 24 h. Therefore, it was of great interest to
measure whether the country case management of fever amongst children under five,
adhered to the NMCP's strategic plan and look into the barriers to the use of
ACT.
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey based on a cluster and multi-stage sampling was
conducted in two rural health districts in Benin. We recruited 768 and 594
children under five years were included in the northern and in the southern
respectively. Data was collected on the general use of ACT and on the correct use
of ACT that adheres to the NMCP's strategy, as well as the barriers that prevent 
the proper management of fever amongst children. To assess the certain predictors
of ACT usage, logistic regression was used, while taking into account the cluster
random effect.
RESULTS: Among febrile children aged 6 to 59 months, 20.7% in the south and 33.9%
in north received ACT. The correct use of ACT, was very low, 5.8% and in southern
and 8.6% northern areas. Caregivers who received information on ACT were 3.13
time more likely in the south and 2.98 time more likely in the north to give ACT 
to their feverish child, PPR = 3.13[1.72-4.15] and PPR = 2.98 [2.72-3.11]
respectively. Chloroquine and quinine, other malaria treatments not recommended
by NMCP, were still being used in both areas: 12.3 and 3.3% in the south and 11.4
and 3.0% in the north.
CONCLUSION: In Benin, the use and the correct use of ACT for febrile children
remains low. The study also showed that having received information about the use
of ACT is positively associated with the use of ACT. This point highlights the
fact that efforts may not have been sufficiently integrated with social
communication, which should be based on the behavioural determinants of
populations.

BACKGROUND: Insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) reduce malaria morbidity and
mortality in endemic areas. Despite increasing availability, the use of ITNs
remains limited in some settings. Poor malaria knowledge is a barrier to the
widespread use of ITNs. The goal of this study was to assess the levels of
malaria knowledge and evaluate factors associated with bed net use among
individuals residing in three regions of southern Africa with different levels of
malaria transmission and control.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on a sample of 7535 residents
recruited from 2066 households in Mutasa District, Zimbabwe (seasonal malaria
transmission), Choma District, Zambia (low transmission) and Nchelenge District, 
Zambia (high transmission), between March 2012 and March 2017. A standardized
questionnaire was used to collect data on demographics, malaria-related knowledge
and use of preventive measures. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were
used to assess determinants of bed net use.
RESULTS: Most of the 3836 adult participants correctly linked mosquito bites to
malaria (85.0%), mentioned at least one malaria symptom (95.5%) and knew of the
benefit of sleeping under an ITN. Bed net ownership and use were highest in Choma
and Nchelenge Districts and lowest in Mutasa District. In multivariate analyses, 
knowledge of ITNs was associated with a 30-40% increased likelihood of bed net
use after adjusting for potential confounders across all sites. Other factors
significantly associated with bed net use were age, household size and
socioeconomic status, although the direction, strength and size of association
varied by study site. Importantly, participants aged 5-14 years had reduced odds 
of sleeping under a bed net compared to children younger than 5 years.
CONCLUSION: Relevant knowledge of ITNs translated into the expected preventive
behaviour of sleeping under a bed net, underscoring the need for continued health
messaging on malaria prevention. The implementation and delivery of malaria
control and elimination interventions needs to consider socioeconomic equity
gaps, and target school-age children to ensure access to and improve utilization 
of ITNs.

Malaria in South Africa is still a problem despite existing efforts to eradicate 
the disease. In the Vhembe District Municipality, malaria prevalence is still
high, with a mean incidence rate of 328.2 per 100,0000 persons/year. This study
aimed at evaluating environmental covariates, such as vegetation moisture and
vegetation greenness, associated with malaria vector distribution for better
predictability towards rapid and efficient disease management and control. The
2005 malaria incidence data combined with Landsat 5 ETM were used in this study. 
A total of nine remotely sensed covariates were derived, while pseudo-absences in
the ratio of 1:2 (presence/absence) were generated at buffer distances of
0.5-20 km from known presence locations. A stepwise logistic regression model was
applied to analyse the spatial distribution of malaria in the area. A buffer
distance of 10 km yielded the highest classification accuracy of 82% at a
threshold of 0.9. This model was significant (ρ < 0.05) and yielded a deviance
(D2) of 36%. The significantly positive relationship (ρ < 0.05) between the
soil-adjusted vegetation index and malaria distribution at all buffer distances
suggests that malaria vector (Anopheles arabiensis) prefer productive and greener
vegetation. The significant negative relationship between water/moisture index
(a1 index) and malaria distribution in buffer distances of 0.5, 10, and 20 km
suggest that malaria distribution increases with a decrease in shortwave
reflectance signal. The study has shown that suitable habitats of malaria vectors
are generally found within a radius of 10 km in semi-arid environments, and this 
insight can be useful to aid efforts aimed at putting in place evidence-based
preventative measures against malaria infections. Furthermore, this result is
important in understanding malaria dynamics under the current climate and
environmental changes. The study has also demonstrated the use of Landsat data
and the ability to extract environmental conditions which favour the distribution
of malaria vector (An. arabiensis) such as the canopy moisture content in
vegetation, which serves as a surrogate for rainfall.

BACKGROUND: Self-medication is a universal challenge that requires attention
because of the potential threat not only to the pregnant women but also to unborn
child. Data on self-medication practice and predictors among pregnant women is
lacking in Tanzania. Information on the effects of this practice to the pregnant 
woman and the foetus globally is also scanty.
METHODS: This was a cross sectional study which was conducted using face to face 
interview with 372 pregnant women at Makongoro health centre. Semi-structured
questionnaires were used. Data were analysed using STATA 13 (Statistical
Corporation, College Station, Texas, US).
RESULTS: A total of 372 pregnant women participated in the study. The prevalence 
of self-medication among pregnant women was 172 (46.24%). There was a significant
statistical association between self-medication and occupation (P value =0.01),
gestation age (P < 0.01) and education (P < 0.01). Age, marital status and
gravidity were not associated with self-medication (P = 0.809, P = 0.243 and
P = 0.922) respectively. When bivariate logistic regression was performed,
occupation and education were the only determining factors for self-medication.
Pregnant women who were unemployed, doing business and house wife were most
likely to practice self-medication than employed pregnant women (P = 0.03;
OR = 2.33; 95% CI, 1.06-5.31, P = 0.01; OR = 2.31; CI 1.21-4.41, P = <0.01,
OR = 2.73, 95% CI 0.52-2.43) respectively. Pregnant women with no formal
education, incomplete primary education, primary education and secondary
education were most likely to practice self-medication than pregnant women with
college or university education (P < 0.01, OR = 6.37 95% CI 2.37-19.03, P < 0.01,
OR = 6.58, 95% CI 2.36-18.25, P < 0.01, OR = 3.78, 95% CI 1.89-7.56, P < 0.01,
OR = 2.59 95% CI = 1.30-5.17). The leading illness/symptoms which led to
self-medication among pregnant women attending clinic were malaria 56 (32.56%,
morning sickness 44 (25.55%) and headache 33(19.19%). Drugs commonly used in
self-medication among pregnant women were ant malarial 42 (24.42%), antiemetics
59 (34.30%) and analgesics 33 (19.19%).
CONCLUSION: Prevalence of self-medication among pregnant women is high in
Tanzania. This is a threat to the safety of the developing foetus and the
pregnant woman. Therefore there is a need of interventions to minimize the
practice among pregnant women.

BACKGROUND: Indoor residual spraying (IRS) is an efficient method of preventing
malaria in homes, and community willingness to take up IRS is critical to its
success. The first phase of IRS was conducted in Tororo district, Uganda between 
December 2014 and January 2015. High coverage rates (90%) were attained in the
district. However, Mulanda sub-county had the lowest coverage of 78%, in the
first round. This study assessed willingness and associated factors of IRS uptake
among household heads for the next IRS campaign in Mulanda sub-county, Tororo
district.
METHODS: A household survey was conducted in all three parishes of Mulanda
sub-county. A multistage sampling technique involving the village and household
as the first and second sampling levels, respectively, was used to identify 640
households Household heads were interviewed using standard questionnaire. Seven
key informants were also conducted to explore the impact of community
IRS-perceptions on uptake. Bi-variable and multi-variable logistic regression
analyses were used to identify factors associated with willingness to take up
IRS. Qualitative data was analysed by thematic content analysis method.
RESULTS: Most (79.9%) respondents were willing to take up repeat IRS. However
this was below the target of 85%. Fear of insecticide adverse effects (62%) was
the most common reason mentioned by 134 (21%) household heads who were not
willing to take up IRS. Factors associated with to take up IRS were;
age ≥ 35 years (AOR 1.9; 95% CI 1.08-3.51), higher socio-economic status (AOR
0.4; 95% CI 0.27-0.98), not taking IRS in previous round (AOR 0.1; 95% CI
0.06-0.23), not knowing reason for conducting IRS (AOR 0.4; 95% CI 0.24-0.78) and
having an iron sheet roof (AOR 2.2; 95% CI 1.03-4.73). Community and religious
leaders were the preferred sources of IRS information.
CONCLUSIONS: The level of willingness to take up IRS was low (79%) compared to
the targeted 85%. Involvement of community and religious leaders in community
sensitization on the efficacy and safety of the chemicals could increase uptake
of IRS.

Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS), the use of insecticides inside residences for
malaria control, may cause elevated exposure to insecticides such as
dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethane (DDT). Evidence suggests that DDT exposure may
increase blood pressure but no study has investigated associations with
hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) in an IRS area. We measured the serum
concentration of DDT and its breakdown product dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethylene
(DDE) at the time of delivery among 733 rural South African women participating
in the Venda Health Examination of Mothers, Babies and their Environment
(VHEMBE). We also collected data on HDP diagnosis through questionnaires
administered to participants and medical record abstraction. We used multiple
logistic regression models to examine the relation between DDT/E and HDP.
p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE serum concentrations were associated with HDP based on
self-report (OR = 1.50; 95%CI = 1.10, 2.03 for p,p'-DDT and OR = 1.58; 95%CI =
1.09, 2.28 for p,p'-DDE) and medical records (OR = 1.32; 95%CI = 0.99, 1.75 for
p,p'-DDT and OR = 1.47; 95%CI = 1.03, 2.09 for p,p'-DDE). p,p'-DDE was also
associated with gestational hypertension (OR = 1.44; 95% CI = 1.00, 2.07).
Exposure to DDT and DDE may be associated with elevated risks of HDP in South
African women residing in an area sprayed for malaria control.

University, Wolkite, Ethiopia.

Background: Globally malaria remains one of the most severe public health
problems resulting in massive morbidity particularly in developing countries.
Ethiopia as one of the sub-Saharan country it is highly endemic to malaria. It
was noted that early detection and prompt treatment of malaria cases, selective
vector control and epidemic prevention and control are the major strategies for
malaria prevention and control; So far, a lot have been done and remarkable
improvements were seen. However, in what extent the prevention strategy was
running in the community and what factors are hindering the prevention strategy
at community level was not well known in Ethiopia. Therefore this study aimed to 
assess measures taken to prevent malaria and associated factors among households 
in Gurage zone, south Ethiopia.
Methods: Community based cross- sectional study was conducted in Gurage zone,
southern Ethiopia. A total of 817 randomly selected households were included in
the study. After checking for completeness the data was entered in to Epi info 7 
and analyzed through SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) version 21.
Descriptive summary was computed and presented by tables, graphs and figures.
After checking for assumptions Bivariate analysis was run to look for the
association between dependent and explanatory variables; and using variables
which have p-value ≤0.25 binary logistic regression was fitted. Association was
presented in Odds ratio with 95% confidence interval and significance determined 
at P-value less than 0.05. Goodness of fit of the final model checked by Hosmer
and Lemshow test.
Results: Overall 496 (62%) of households practiced good measure of malaria
prevention and control. Educated households (AOR = 2.15 (95% CI [1.21-4.67]),
higher wealth index (AOR = 3.3 (95% CI [2.3-6.2]), iron corrugated house owners
(AOR = 2.7 (95% CI [1.7-3.5]), who received ITN from HC (AOR = 3.6 (95% CI
[1.7-4.5] and involved in malaria prevention campaign AOR = 2.6, (95% CI
[1.8-3.6]) were independently and significantly determined the practice of
malaria prevention measures.
Conclusion: The practice of malaria prevention measures were at acceptable and
comparable level to other national findings and standards. Further strengthening 
of the program is important.

BACKGROUND: Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) have remained
efficacious treatments of acute falciparum malaria in many endemic areas but
there is little evaluation of factors contributing to the anaemia of acute
falciparum malaria following long term adoption of ACTs as first-line
antimalarials in African children.
METHODS: Malarious <5 year-olds randomized to artemether-lumefantrine,
artesunate-amodiaquine or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine treatments were followed
up clinically for 6 weeks. Anaemia was defined as haematocrit <30%;
Malaria-attributable fall in haematocrit (MAFH) as the difference between
haematocrit 28-42 days post- and pre-treatment; Total MAFH (TMAFH) as the
difference between days 28-42 haematocrit and the lowest haematocrit recorded in 
the first week post-treatment initiation; Drug-attributable fall in haematocrit
(DAFH) as the difference between MAFH and TMAFH; Early appearing anaemia (EAA) as
haematocrit <30% occurring within 1 week in children with normal haematocrit
pre-treatment. Predictors of anaemia pre-treatment, EAA, MAFH or DAFH >4% were
evaluated by stepwise multiple logistic regression models. Survival analysis and 
kinetics of DAFH were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier estimator and non-compartment
model, respectively.
RESULTS: Pre-treatment, 355 of 959 children were anaemic. Duration of illness
>2 days and parasitaemia ≤10,000 μL-1 were independent predictors of anaemia
pre-treatment. EAA occurred in 301 of 604 children. Predictors of EAA were
age ≤ 15 months, history of fever pre-treatment and enrolment haematocrit ≤35%.
The probabilities of progression from normal haematocrit to EAA were similar for 
all treatments. MAFH >4% occurred in 446 of 694 children; its predictors were
anaemia pre-treatment, enrolment parasitaemia ≤50,000 μL-1, parasitaemia one day 
post-treatment initiation and gametocytaemia. DAFH >4% occurred in 334 of 719
children; its predictors were history of fever pre-and fever 1 day post-treatment
initiation, haematocrit ≥37%, and parasitaemia >100,000 μL-1. In 432 children,
declines in DAFH deficits were monoexponential with overall estimated half-time
of 2.2d (95% CI 1.9-2.6). Area under curve of deficits in DAFH versus time and
estimated half-time were significantly higher in non-anaemic children indicating 
greater loss of haematocrit in these children.
CONCLUSION: After ten years of adoption of ACTs, anaemia is common pre-and early 
post-treatment, falls in haematocrit attributable to a single infection is high, 
and DAFH >4% is common and significantly lower in anaemic compared to non-anaemic
Nigerian children.

BACKGROUND: Management of pneumonia in many low-income and middle-income
countries is based on WHO guidelines that classify children according to clinical
signs that define thresholds of risk. We aimed to establish whether some children
categorised as eligible for outpatient treatment might have a risk of death
warranting their treatment in hospital.
METHODS: We did a retrospective cohort study of children aged 2-59 months
admitted to one of 14 hospitals in Kenya with pneumonia between March 1, 2014,
and Feb 29, 2016, before revised WHO pneumonia guidelines were adopted in the
country. We modelled associations with inpatient mortality using logistic
regression and calculated absolute risks of mortality for presenting clinical
features among children who would, as part of revised WHO pneumonia guidelines,
be eligible for outpatient treatment (non-severe pneumonia).
FINDINGS: We assessed 16 162 children who were admitted to hospital in this
period. 832 (5%) of 16 031 children died. Among groups defined according to new
WHO guidelines, 321 (3%) of 11 788 patients with non-severe pneumonia died
compared with 488 (14%) of 3434 patients with severe pneumonia. Three
characteristics were strongly associated with death of children retrospectively
classified as having non-severe pneumonia: severe pallor (adjusted risk ratio
5·9, 95% CI 5·1-6·8), mild to moderate pallor (3·4, 3·0-3·8), and weight-for-age 
Z score (WAZ) less than -3 SD (3·8, 3·4-4·3). Additional factors that were
independently associated with death were: WAZ less than -2 to -3 SD, age younger 
than 12 months, lower chest wall indrawing, respiratory rate of 70 breaths per
min or more, female sex, admission to hospital in a malaria endemic region,
moderate dehydration, and an axillary temperature of 39°C or more.
INTERPRETATION: In settings of high mortality, WAZ less than -3 SD or any degree 
of pallor among children with non-severe pneumonia was associated with a
clinically important risk of death. Our data suggest that admission to hospital
should not be denied to children with these signs and we urge clinicians to
consider these risk factors in addition to WHO criteria in their decision making.

Background: Insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITNs) are one of the most
effective tools for preventing malaria in sub-Saharan Africa.
Objective: This study examined knowledge, attitude, and practice on the use of
ITNs in the prevention of malaria among pregnant women and guardians of children 
under five in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Methods: A total of 5,138 pregnant women and guardians of children under five
were interviewed.
Results: The majority of participants (>80%) knew the signs and symptoms of
malaria; 81.6% reported having an ITN in the household, but 78.4% reported using 
it the night before the interview. Only 71.4% of pregnant women used ITN the
night compared to 68.2% of children under five. In the Logistic Regression model,
women who believed that it is normal to use ITNs were 1.9 times more likely to
use it than those who did not (OR: 1.930); women who were confident in their
abilities to use ITNs were 1.9 times more likely than those who were not
confident (OR: 1.915); and women who had a good attitude towards ITNs were also
more likely to use ITNs compared to those who did not (OR: 1.529).
Conclusion: New and innovative evidence-based behavior change interventions are
needed to increase the utilization of ITNs among vulnerable groups.

Derbie A(1), Alemu M(1).

Author information: 
(1)Department of Medical Microbiology, Immunology and Parasitology, College of
Medicine and Health Sciences, Bahir Dar University, Bahir Dar, Ethiopia.

Background: An estimated 68% of the Ethiopian population, living in 75% of the
landmass, is at risk of contracting malaria at any time making it the leading
public health problem. The temporal analysis of malaria data could be important
to evaluate the performance of malaria prevention programmes. Thus, the aim of
this study was to determine the trend of malaria at Woreta Health Center (WHC)
over a period of five years.
Methods: We analyzed the records of 8,057 presumptive malaria patients registered
in 2012 to 2016. The following patient data were retrieved from laboratory
registration logbook for analysis: sex, age, residence, blood film (BF)
microscopy result, type of malaria parasite identified, year and month when the
patients visited WHC. Logistic regression was employed to assess the association 
between potential associated factors and positive BF result; p < 0.05 was
considered significant.
Results: Among the total presumptive individuals, 4447(55.2%) were females. The
prevalence of malaria in each year ranged from 4.1% to 6.7%. The overall
prevalence of malaria was 5.4% (95%CI: 4.9%-5.9%). The two most important species
of malaria parasite identified were P. falciparum at 233(53.7%) and P. vivax at
184(42.4%). Relatively higher proportions of cases were documented in the months 
of November, December and June (11.1%, 8.1% and 7.2%, respectively). Patients who
visited the health center in the month of December were >4 times more likely to
be infected as compared with those who came to the health center in September
[AOR: 4.2, 95%CI (2.374-7.560)]. Females were 1.3 times more likely to be
infected than males, [AOR: 1.3, 95%CI (1.101-1.638)]. Similarly, patients in the 
age group above 15 were 1.9 times more likely to be infected than individuals <
5, [AOR: 1.9 95%CI (1.498-2.455), p value 0.000].
Conclusion: In the studied area, malaria remains a major public health challenge.
Hence, interventions to decrease the impact of the disease have to be evaluated
and strengthened.

Background: Antibiotic resistance mechanisms originating in low- and middle-
income countries are among the most common worldwide. Reducing unnecessary
antibiotic use in India, the world's largest antibiotic consumer, is crucial to
control antimicrobial resistance globally. Limited data describing factors
influencing Indian clinicians to start or stop antibiotics are available.
Methods: Febrile adults and children admitted to a public tertiary care hospital 
in Pune, India, were enrolled. Antibiotic usage and clinical history were
recorded. Immunoassays for mosquito-borne disease and bacterial cultures were
performed by protocol and clinician-directed testing. Clinical factors were
assessed for association with empiric antibiotic initiation and discontinuation
by day 5 using multivariable logistic regression and propensity score-matched Cox
proportional hazard models.
Results: Among 1486 participants, 683 (82%) adults and 614 (94%) children
received empiric antibiotics. Participants suspected of having mosquito-borne
disease were less likely to receive empiric antibiotics (adjusted odds ratio
[AOR], 0.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], .4-.8). Empiric antibiotics were
discontinued in 450 (35%) participants by day 5. Dengue or malaria testing
performed before day 4 was positive in 162 (12%) participants, and was associated
with antibiotic discontinuation (AOR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.2-2.4). In a propensity
score-matched model accounting for admission suspicion of mosquito-borne disease,
positive dengue or malaria tests increased hazard of antibiotic discontinuation
(hazard ratio, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2-2.0).
Conclusions: Most patients with acute febrile illness in an Indian public
hospital setting receive empiric antibiotics. Mosquito-borne disease
identification is associated with reduced empiric antibiotic use and faster
antibiotic discontinuation.

Background: Malaria is one of the most challenging public health concerns in the 
developing world. To address its impact in endemic regions, several interventions
are implemented by stakeholders. The Affordable Medicine Facility-malaria (AMFm) 
is an example of such interventions. Its activities include communication
interventions to enhance the knowledge of caregivers of children under five
years, licensed chemical sellers (LCS) and prescribers on malaria management with
artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT). This study was conducted to evaluate
the effectiveness of the AMFm activities on malaria among targeted groups in two 
rural communities in Ghana.
Methods: A communication intervention study was conducted in the Asante-Akim
North and South Districts of Ghana. Repeated cross-sectional pre and post surveys
were deployed. Relevant malaria messages were designed and used to develop the
information, education and communication (IEC) tools for the intervention. With
the aid of posters and flipcharts developed by our study, community health
workers (CHWs), prescribers, and licenced chemical sellers provided proper
counselling to clients on malaria management. Trained CHWs and community based
volunteers educated caregivers of children under five years on malaria management
at their homes and at public gatherings such as churches, mosques, schools.
Chi-square tests and logistic regression were run to determine associations and
control for demographic differences respectively.
Results: There was significantly high exposure to malaria/ACT interventions in
the intervention district than in the comparison district (OR = 16.02; 95%
CI = 7.88-32.55) and same for malaria/ACT-related knowledge (OR = 3.63; 95%
CI = 2.52-5.23). The participants in the intervention district were also more
knowledgeable about correct administration of dispersible drug for children
<5 years than their counterparts in the unexposed district.
Conclusion: Our data show that targeted interventions improve malaria based
competences in rural community settings. The availability of subsidized ACTs and 
the intensity of the communication campaigns contributed to the AMFm-related
awareness, improved knowledge on malaria/ACTs and management practices.

The Nuisance Mosquito Anopheles plumbeus (Stephens, 1828) in Germany-A
Questionnaire Survey May Help Support Surveillance and Control.

The mosquito species Anopheles plumbeus is an aggressive biter and a potential
vector of malaria parasites and West Nile virus. It occurs naturally at low
population densities, as its larval development is adapted to the specific water 
qualities found in tree holes. However, probably owing to environmental changes, 
it has recently been observed in several European countries to use increasingly
often artificial breeding habitats that may lead to mass development and severe
annoyance to humans living close by. The perception of mosquito nuisance,
however, is very subjective, and breeding habitats are not always known, thus
impeding targeted surveillance and control. To relate nuisance by An. plumbeus to
specific environmental conditions, a questionnaire survey was carried out
addressing persons who had submitted specimens of this particular mosquito
species to the German citizen science project "Mueckenatlas", an instrument of
passive mosquito surveillance. The questionnaire was intended to find out whether
a nuisance situation linked to An. plumbeus had existed, whether mosquito
breeding habitats could be identified and whether control measures had been
conducted. Despite some efforts, the participants who claimed to suffer from an
An. plumbeus nuisance problem had rarely identified the source of the mosquitoes.
Once control measures had been performed on abandoned manure pits, however, the
nuisance problem disappeared or mosquito abundance was at least significantly
reduced. Nevertheless, no significant effect of abandoned manure pits on the
probability of an An. plumbeus nuisance could be demonstrated in a multivariate
logistic regression model testing various variables. Instead, a significant
positive effect of a disused farm nearby was found. The reason is probably that
manure pits as the most frequent source of An. plumbeus mass development are
often located on disused farms, without most people's knowledge about their
existence. Disused farms are therefore appropriate candidates to consider when it
comes to public health issues connected to An. plumbeus such as surveillance of
mass development and implementation of control measures.

Background: Research shows inadequate Integrated Management of Childhood Illness 
(IMCI)-pneumonia care in various low-income settings but evidence is largely from
small-scale studies with limited evidence of patient-, provider- and
facility-levels determinants of IMCI non-severe pneumonia classification and its 
management.
Methods: The Malawi Service Provision Assessment 2013-2014 included 3149
outpatients aged 2-59 months with completed observations, interviews and
re-examinations. Mixed-effects logistic regression models quantified the
influence of patient-, provider and facility-level determinants on having IMCI
non-severe pneumonia and its management in observed consultations.
Findings: Among 3149 eligible outpatients, 590 (18.7%) had IMCI non-severe
pneumonia classification in re-examination. 228 (38.7%) classified cases received
first-line antibiotics and 159 (26.9%) received no antibiotics. 18.6% with cough 
or difficult breathing had 60-second respiratory rates counted during
consultations, and conducting this assessment was significantly associated with
IMCI training ever received (odds ratio (OR) = 2.37, 95% confidence interval
(CI): 1.29-4.31) and negative rapid diagnostic test results (OR = 3.21, 95% CI:
1.45-7.13). Older children had lower odds of assessments than infants (OR = 48-59
months: 0.35, 95% CI: 0.16-0.75). Children presenting with any of the following
complaints also had reduced odds of assessment: fever, diarrhea, skin problem or 
any danger sign. First-line antibiotic treatment for classified cases was
significantly associated with high temperatures (OR = 3.26, 95% CI: 1.24-8.55)
while older children had reduced odds of first-line treatment compared to infants
(OR = 48-59 months: 0.29, 95% CI: 0.10-0.83). RDT-confirmed malaria was a
significant predictor of no antibiotic receipt for IMCI non-severe pneumonia
(OR = 10.65, 95% CI: 2.39-47.36).
Conclusions: IMCI non-severe pneumonia care was sub-optimal in Malawi health
facilities in 2013-2014 with inadequate assessments and prescribing practices
that must be addressed to reduce this leading cause of mortality. Child's
symptoms and age, malaria diagnosis and provider training were primary influences
on assessment and treatment practices. Current evidence could be used to better
target IMCI training and support to improve pneumonia care for sick children in
Malawi facilities.

BACKGROUND: Malaria is the leading cause of disease burden across the world,
especially in African countries. Ethiopia has designed a five year (2011-2015)
plan to cover 100% of the households in malarious areas with one insecticide
treated net (ITN) for every two persons, and to raise consistent ITN utilization 
to at least 80%. However, evidence on ownership of ITN among malarious rural
households in northwest Ethiopia is quite limited. Hence, the present study aimed
at assessing ownership of ITN and associated factors among rural households at
risk of malaria at Dabat Health and Demographic Surveillance System site,
northwest Ethiopia.
METHODS: A cross sectional re-census was carried out in Dabat Health and
Demographic Surveillance System site during peak malaria seasons from October to 
December, 2014. Data for 15,088 households at Dabat Health and Demographic
Surveillance System site were used for the analysis. Descriptive measures and
binary logistic regression were carried out.
RESULTS: Among those who owned at least one ITN, 53.4% were living at an altitude
>2500 m above sea level. However, out of households living at an altitude <2000 m
above sea level, 15.8% (95% CI 14.4%, 17.3%) owned ITN at an average of 4.3 ± 2.1
persons per ITN. Of these, 69.5% (95% CI 64.7%, 74.1%) used the ITN. Among
utilizing households at malarious areas, 23.7% prioritized pregnant women and
31.4% children to use ITN. The availability of radio receiver/mobile (AOR 1.60,
95%CI 1.08, 2.35) and secondary/above educational status of household member (AOR
1.54, 95%CI 1.19, 2.04) were predictors of ownership of ITN.
CONCLUSION: Rural households at risk of malaria did not own a sufficient number
of ITN though the utilization is promising. Moreover, prioritizing children and
pregnant women to sleep under ITN remains public health problems. Programmers,
partners and implementers should consider tailored intervention strategy
stratified by altitude in distributing ITN. ITN distribution should also be
accompanied by using exhaustive promotion strategies that consider people without
access to any source of information, and educating households to prioritize
pregnant and under five children to sleep under ITN.

BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of
insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and intermittent preventive treatment in
pregnancy (IPTp) as a cost-effective intervention for the prevention of malaria
during pregnancy in endemic areas. This study was conducted to investigate: (1)
the extent of use of both IPTp and ITNs, and (2) conduct multinomial regression
to identify factors affecting the optimal usage of IPTp and ITNs among women with
a recent pregnancy in Senegal.
METHODS: Data was drawn from the 2013-2014 Demographic and Health Survey. A total
of 4616 women aged 15-49 years old, who had a recent pregnancy were analyzed.
Multinomial logistic regression model was used to assess factors associated with 
optimal uptake of malaria preventive strategies (both IPTp and ITN use).
RESULTS: Amongst women who had a recent pregnancy, less than half of them used
ITNs (46.84%) however, 80.35% reported taking IPTp during their last pregnancy.
Overall, 37.51% reported using the optimal malaria preventive strategies. Women
aged 35-49 years and living in the richer or middle wealth quintile were more
likely to use optimal prevention methods. Pregnant women living in Diourbel,
Saint-Louis, Thies, Louga, Fatick and Matam were more likely to use both IPTp-SP 
and ITNs compared to those living in Dakar. Additionally, women who initiated
antenatal care in at least at 6 weeks of pregnancy or who attended four antenatal
visits or more were more likely to use optimal malaria preventive methods during 
pregnancy.
CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown important factors that influence the uptake of 
malaria prevention methods during pregnancy in Senegal. These findings highlight 
the need for targeted preventive strategies when designing and implementing
policies aimed at improving the uptake of these measures during pregnancy in
Senegal.

Creating better access to good quality healthcare for the poor is a major
challenge to development. In this study, we examined inter-linkages between
poverty and disease, referred to as poverty-related diseases (PRDs), by
investigating how Cameroon Development Corporation (CDC) camp dwellers respond to
diseases that adversely affect their health and wellbeing. Living in plantation
camps is associated with poverty, overcrowding, poor sanitation and the rapid
spread of diseases. In a survey of 237 CDC camp dwellers in Cameroon, we used the
health belief model to understand the drivers (perceived threats, benefits and
cues for treatment seeking) of reported responses. Using logistic regression
analysis, we looked for trends in people's response to malaria. We calculated the
odds ratio of factors shown to have an influence on people's health, such as
food, water, sanitation challenges and seeking formal healthcare for malaria.
Malaria (40.3%), cholera (20.8%) and diarrhoea (17.7%) were the major PRDs
perceived by camp dwellers. We found a strong link between what respondents
perceived as PRDS and hygiene conditions. Poverty for our respondents was more
about living in poor hygiene conditions than lack of money. Respondents perceived
health challenges as stemming from their immediate living environment. Moreover, 
people employed self-medication and other informal health practices to seek
healthcare. Interestingly, even though respondents reported using formal
healthcare services as a general response to illness (84%), almost 90% stated
that, in the case of malaria, they would use informal healthcare services. Our
study recommends that efforts to curb the devastating effects of PRDs should have
a strong focus on perceptions (i.e. include diseases that people living in
conditions of poverty perceive as PRDs) and on hygiene practices, emphasising how
they can be improved. By providing insights into the inter-linkages between
poverty and disease, our study offers relevant guidance for potentially
successful health promotion interventions.

Background: In the Lao PDR, the incidence of malaria greatly differs among
villages even within a subdistrict, and the reasons for this difference are
poorly understood. The objective of this study was to identify differences in
villagers' behavior and the household environment between villages with high
incidences and those with low incidences of malaria in a rural district of the
Lao PDR.
Methods: A case-control study was conducted in Xepon district, Savannakhet
province. Case villages were defined as those with a high incidence (> 10 cases
per 1000 population per year), and control villages were those with a low
incidence (0-10 cases per 1000 population per year). Data were collected from 178
households in the six case villages and six control villages between December
2016 and January 2017. The data collection consisted of an interview survey with 
the heads of households and an observational survey in and around the house.
Logistic regression was used to assess the association between the case-control
status and individual-level behavioral factors and household-level environmental 
factors adjusted for socio-demographic and economic factors.
Results: Compared to the household members in the control villages, household
members in the case villages were significantly more likely to work at night in
the forest (adjusted odds ratio 1.95; 95% confidence interval 1.28 to 2.98) and
more likely to sleep overnight in the forest (adjusted odds ratio 1.94; 95%
confidence interval 1.13 to 3.33). Additionally, compared to the households in
the control villages, households in the case villages were significantly more
likely to have an open space on the house surface (adjusted odds ratio 3.64; 95% 
confidence interval 1.68 to 7.84).
Conclusions: There were significant differences in nighttime working and sleeping
behaviors in the forest and the presence of an open space on the house surface in
the case versus control villages. These differences can partly explain the
difference in the incidences of malaria among the villages. The Lao National
Malaria Control Program should recommend that villagers use personal protection
when working and sleeping in the forest and to reduce any open space on the house
surfaces.

Malaria remains a significant public health concern in developing countries.
Drivers of malaria transmission vary across different geographical regions.
Climatic variables are major risk factor in seasonal and secular patterns of P.
vivax malaria transmission along Anhui province. The study aims to forecast
malaria outbreaks using empirical model developed in Hefei, China. Data on the
monthly numbers of notified malaria cases and climatic factors were obtained for 
the period of January 1st 1990 to December 31st 2011 from the Hefei CDC and Anhui
Institute of Meteorological Sciences, respectively. Two logistic regression
models with time series seasonal decomposition were used to explore the impact of
climatic and seasonal factors on malaria outbreaks. Sensitivity and specificity
statistics were used for evaluating the predictive power. The results showed that
relative humidity (OR = 1.171, 95% CI = 1.090-1.257), sunshine (OR = 1.076, 95%
CI = 1.043-1.110) and barometric pressure (OR = 1.051, 95% CI = 1.003-1.100) were
significantly associated with malaria outbreaks after adjustment for seasonality 
in Hefei area. The validation analyses indicated the overall agreement of 70.42% 
(sensitivity: 70.52%; specificity: 70.30%). The research suggested that the
empirical model developed based on disease surveillance and climatic conditions
may have applications in malaria control and prevention activities.

The study was conducted with an objective to investigate the association between 
reproductive factors, nutritional status and serum 25(OH)D levels among women
diagnosed with breast cancer (BC). A total of 200 women with BC attending a
tertiary healthcare institute of Delhi, India matched with 200 healthy women for 
age (±2years) and socio economic status were included in the study. Data was
collected on socio-demographic profile, reproductive factors, physical activity
and dietary intake (24h dietary recall and food frequency questionnaire) using
interviewer administered structured questionnaires and standard tools. Non
fasting blood samples (5ml) were collected for the biochemical estimation of
serum 25(OH)D and calcium levels by chemiluminescent immunoassay and colorimetric
assay technique. Data was analyzed by univariable conditional logistic regression
and significant variables with (p<0.05), were analyzed in final model by
conditional multivariable logistic regression analysis. The mean age of patients 
at diagnosis of BC was 45±10years. Results of multivariable conditional logistic 
regression analysis revealed significantly higher odds of BC for reproductive
factors like age at marriage (more than 23 years), number of abortions, history
or current use of oral contraceptive pills (OCP), with [OR (95% CI)] of [2.4
(1.2-4.9)], [4.0 (1.6-12.6)], [2.4 (1.2-5.0)]. Women with physically light
activities and occasional consumption of eggs were found to have higher odds of
BC [4.6 (1.6-13.0)] and [3.2 (1.6-6.3)]. Women with serum 25(OH)D levels less
than 20ng/ml and calcium levels less than 10.5mg/dl had higher odds of having BC 
[2.4 (1.2-5.1)] and [3.7 (1.5-8.8)]. A protective effect of urban areas as place 
of residence and energy intake greater than 50% of Recommended Dietary Allowance 
(RDA) per day against BC was observed (p<0.05). The findings of the present study
revealed a significant association of reproductive and dietary factors in
addition to sedentary physical activity and low serum 25(OH)D levels in women
diagnosed with BC.

BACKGROUND: Migration flows and the emerging resistance to artemisinin-based
combination therapy in the Greater Mekong Sub-region (GMS) create programmatic
challenges to meeting the AD 2030 malaria elimination target in Myanmar. The
National Malaria Control Programme (NMCP) targeted migrant workers based mainly
on the stability of their worksites (categories 1: permanent work-setting;
categories 2 and 3: less stable work-settings). This study aims to assess the
migration patterns, malaria treatment-seeking preferences, and challenges
encountered by mobile/migrant workers at remote sites in a malaria-elimination
setting.
METHODS: A mixed-methods explanatory sequential study retrospectively analysed
the secondary data acquired through migrant mapping surveys (2013-2015) in six
endemic regions (n = 9603). A multivariate logistic regression model was used to 
ascertain the contributing factors. A qualitative strand (2016-2017) was added by
conducting five focus-group discussions (n = 50) and five in-depth interviews
with migrant workers from less stable worksites in Shwegyin Township, Bago
Region. The contiguous approach was used to integrate quantitative and
qualitative findings.
RESULTS: Among others, migrant workers from Bago Region were significantly more
likely to report the duration of stay ≥ 12 months (63% vs. 49%) and high seasonal
mobility (40% vs. 35%). Particularly in less stable settings, a very low
proportion of migrant workers (17%) preferred to seek malaria treatment from the 
public sector and was significantly influenced by the worksite stability
(adjusted OR = 1.4 and 2.3, respectively for categories 2 and 1); longer duration
of stay (adjusted OR = 3.5); and adjusted OR < 2 for received malaria messages,
knowledge of malaria symptoms and awareness of means of malaria diagnosis.
Qualitative data further elucidated their preference for the informal healthcare 
sector, due to convenience, trust and good relations, and put migrant workers at 
risk of substandard care. Moreover, the availability of cheap anti-malarial in
unregistered small groceries encouraged self-medication. Infrequent or no contact
with rural health centres and voluntary health workers worsened the situation.
CONCLUSIONS: Mitigating key drivers that favour poor utilization of public-sector
services among highly mobile migrant workers in less stable work-settings should 
be given priority in a malaria-elimination setting. These issues are challenging 
for the NMCP in Myanmar and might be generalized to other countries in the GMS to
achieve malaria-elimination goals. Further innovative out-reach programmes
designed and implemented specific to the nature of mobile/migrant workers is
crucial.

BACKGROUND: Rapid diagnostic test (RDT) positivity is supplanting microscopy as
the standard measure of malaria burden at the population level. However, there is
currently no standard for externally validating RDT results from field surveys.
METHODS: Individuals' blood concentration of the Plasmodium falciparum histidine 
rich protein 2 (HRP2) protein were compared to results of HRP2-detecting RDTs in 
participants from field surveys in Angola, Mozambique, Haiti, and Senegal. A
logistic regression model was used to estimate the HRP2 concentrations
corresponding to the 50 and 90% level of detection (LOD) specific for each
survey.
RESULTS: There was a sigmoidal dose-response relationship between HRP2
concentration and RDT positivity for all surveys. Variation was noted in
estimates for field RDT sensitivity, with the 50% LOD ranging between 0.076 and
6.1 ng/mL and the 90% LOD ranging between 1.1 and 53 ng/mL. Surveys conducted in 
two different provinces of Angola using the same brand of RDT and same study
methodology showed a threefold difference in LOD.
CONCLUSIONS: Measures of malaria prevalence estimated using population RDT
positivity should be interpreted in the context of potentially large variation in
RDT LODs between, and even within, surveys. Surveys based on RDT positivity would
benefit from external validation of field RDT results by comparing RDT positivity
and antigen concentration.

BACKGROUND: Despite the high prevalence of helminth infections among
preschool-aged children, control programs in sub-Saharan countries primarily
focus on school-aged populations. We assessed the prevalence of helminth
infections and determined risk factors for infection among preschool-aged
children in the urban setting of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
METHODOLOGY: Starting in October 2015, we conducted a 12-month prospective study 
among tuberculosis (TB)-exposed children under the age of 5 years and unexposed
controls from neighboring households. At the time of recruitment, we collected
medical histories, assessed development and cognitive functions, and performed
medical examinations. We performed full blood cell counts and screened for HIV
and malaria. Point-of-care circulating cathodic antigen (POC-CCA), urine
filtration, Kato-Katz, FLOTAC, and Baermann tests were employed to detect
helminth infections in urine and stool. Helminth infections were stratified for
Schistosoma and other helminths to identify risk factors, using logistic
regression.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We included 310 children with a median age of 26 months
(inter quartile range 17-42 months) in the study. Among these, 189 were
TB-exposed and 121 TB-unexposed. Two thirds of the children were anemic
(hemoglobin level <11 g/dl) and the HIV prevalence was 1.3%. Schistosoma spp. was
the predominant helminth species (15.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI]
12.1-20.3%). Other helminth infections were less frequent (9.0%, 95% CI
6.3-12.8%). Poor hygiene, use of household water sources, and TB-exposure were
not associated with helminth infection. Development and cognitive scores did not 
significantly differ in helminth-infected and uninfected peers, but hemoglobin
levels were significantly lower in helminth-infected children (10.1 g/dl vs. 10.4
g/dl, p = 0.027).
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In Dar es Salaam, a city with more than 4 million
inhabitants, the prevalence of Schistosoma spp. infection among preschool-aged
children was unexpectedly high. Setting-specific interventions that target
preschool-aged children and urban settlements should be considered to reduce the 
transmission of Schistosoma and other helminth infections and to improve
children's health.

BACKGROUND: Approximately 80% of deaths attributed to malaria worldwide occurred 
mainly in Africa in 2015. Kenya is one of the major malaria endemic countries,
making malaria the leading public health concern in this country. This study
intended to document the prevalence of malaria and determine associated factors
including socioeconomic status among children aged 6 months to 14 years in Kenya.
METHODS: This study analyzed the secondary data extracted from the 2015 Kenya
Malaria Indicator Survey (KMIS), a cross-sectional country representative survey.
Associations of demographic, socioeconomic, community-based, and behavioral
factors with the prevalence of malaria in children were analyzed using
multivariable logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: Data from 7040 children aged 6 months to 14 years were analyzed. The
prevalence of malaria showed an upward trend in terms of age, with the highest
prevalence among children aged 11-14 years. Prevalence was also higher among
rural children (10.16%) compared to urban children (2.93%), as well as poor
children (11.05%) compared to rich children (3.23%). The likelihood of having
malaria was higher among children aged 10-14 years (AOR = 4.47, 95% CI = 3.33,
6.02; P < 0.001) compared with children aged under 5 years. The presence of
anemia (AOR = 3.52, 95% CI = 2.78, 4.45; P < 0.001), rural residence (AOR = 1.71,
95% CI = 1.31, 2.22; P < 0.001), lack of a hanging mosquito net (AOR = 2.38, 95% 
CI = 1.78, 3.19; P < 0.001), primary education level of the household head
(AOR = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.08, 2.25; P < 0.05), and other factors, such as the
household having electricity and access to media such as television or radio,
were also associated with the likelihood of infection.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the need to focus on awareness programs to
prevent malaria and to use existing knowledge in practice to control the malaria 
burden in Kenya. Furthermore, this study suggests that improving the information 
available through the mass media and introducing behavior change communication
and intervention program specifically for those of poor socioeconomic status will
help to reduce malaria cases.

Introduction:A large proportion of the Ethiopian population (approximately 68%)
lives in malaria risk areas. Millions of long-lasting insecticide treated nets
(LLINs) have been distributed as part of the malaria prevention and control
strategy in the country. This study assessed the ownership, access and use of
LLNs in the malaria endemic southwest Ethiopia. Methods: A community-based
cross-sectional study was conducted in southwest Ethiopia during October-November
2015, including 836 households from sixteen villages around Gilgel-Gibe dam area.
Indicators of ownership, access and use of LLINs were derived following the Roll 
Back Malaria (RBM) guidelines. Factors associated with failure for both LLIN
access and use were analysed at household level using a multivariate logistic
regression model. Results: The proportion of households with at least one LLIN
was 82.7% (95% CI: 80.0, 85.1). However, only 68.9% (95% CI: 65.6, 71.9) had
enough LLINs to cover all family members (with ≥one LLIN for every two persons). 
While 75.3% (95% CI: 68.4, 83.0) of the population was estimated to have accessed
to LLINs, only 63.8% (95% CI: 62.3, 65.2) reported to have used a LLIN the
previous night. The intra-household gap (i.e., households owning at least one
LLIN, but unable to cover all family members) and the behavioral gap (i.e.,
household members who did not sleep under a LLIN despite having access to one)
were 16.8% and 10.5%, respectively. Age, marital status and education of
household heads, as well as household size and cooking using firewood were
associated with the access to enough LLINs within households. Decreased access to
LLINs at households was the main determinant for not achieving ≥80% household
members sleeping under a LLIN the previous night. Other associated factors were
household size and education level of household head. Conclusions: LLIN coverage 
levels in study villages remain below national targets of 100% for ownership and 
80% for use. The access to enough LLINs within the households is the main
restriction of LLIN use in the study area.

BACKGROUND: Anemia during pregnancy is one of the most common indirect obstetric 
cause of maternal mortality in developing countries. It is responsible for poor
maternal and fetal outcomes. A limited number of studies were conducted on anemia
during pregnancy in Ethiopia, and they present inconsistent findings. Therefore, 
this review was undertaken to summarize the findings conducted in several parts
of the country and present the national level of anemia among pregnant women in
Ethiopia.
METHODS: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
(PRISMA) guideline was followed for this systematic review and meta-analysis. The
databases used were; PUBMED, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, CINAHL, and
African Journals Online. Search terms used were; anemia, pregnancy related anemia
and Ethiopia. Joanna Briggs Institute Meta-Analysis of Statistics Assessment and 
Review Instrument (JBI-MAStARI) was used for critical appraisal of studies. The
meta-analysis was conducted using STATA 14 software. The pooled Meta logistic
regression was computed to present the pooled prevalence and relative risks (RRs)
of the determinate factors with 95% confidence interval (CI).
RESULTS: Twenty studies were included in the meta-analysis with a total of 10,
281 pregnant women. The pooled prevalence of anemia among pregnant women in
Ethiopia was 31.66% (95% CI (26.20, 37.11)). Based on the pooled prevalence of
the subgroup analysis result, the lowest prevalence of anemia among pregnant
women was observed in Amhara region, 15.89% (95% CI (8.82, 22.96)) and the
highest prevalence was in Somali region, 56.80% (95% CI (52.76, 60.84)).
Primigravid (RR: 0.61 (95% CI: 0.53, 0.71)) and urban women (RR: 0.73 (95% CI:
0.60, 0.88)) were less likely to develop anemia. On the other hand, mothers with 
short pregnancy interval (RR: 2.14 (95% CI: 1.67, 2.74)) and malaria infection
during pregnancy (RR: 1.94 (95% CI: 1.33, 2.82)) had higher risk to develop
anemia.
CONCLUSIONS: Almost one-third of pregnant women in Ethiopia were anemic.
Statistically significant association was observed between anemia during
pregnancy and residence, gravidity, pregnancy interval, and malaria infection
during pregnancy. Regions with higher anemia prevalence among pregnant women
should be given due emphasis. The concerned body should intervene on the
identified factors to reduce the high prevalence of anemia among pregnant women.

BACKGROUND: Babesia, usually found in wild and domestic mammals worldwide, have
recently been responsible for emerging malaria-like zoonosis in infected
patients. Human B. microti infection has been identified in China, primarily in
the Southwest along the Myanmar border but little direct surveillance of B.
microti infection in rodents has been carried out here (Yunnan province). In this
region, a diverse topographic range combined with tropical moisture sustains a
high biodiversity of small mammals, which might play important role on Babesia
transmission.
METHODS: Small mammals were captured in 141 sample locations from 18 counties
located Yunnan Province, and screened for B. microti-like parasites infection by 
a nested PCR to target 18S rRNA gene of Babesia, plus directly sequencing for
positive samples. Univariate and multivariate forward stepwise logistic
regression analysis was used to access the association between infections and
some related risk factors.
RESULTS: Infection with Babesia microti was confirmed in 2.4% (53/ 2204) of small
mammals. Significant differences in prevalence rates of B. microti were observed 
based on variations in forest, agricultural, and residential landscapes.
Furthermore, adult small mammals had higher prevalence rates than younger,
pubertal mammals. The near full-length 18S rRNA gene revealed that there were two
types of B. microti, Kobe and Otsu, which demonstrate the genetic diversity and
regional distribution.
CONCLUSIONS: There exists a wide distribution and genetic diversity of endemic B.
microti in Southwestern China, warranting further investigations and monitoring
of clinical disease in individuals presenting with Babesia like symptoms in these
areas.

BACKGROUND: The incidence of malaria due both to Plasmodium falciparum and
Plasmodium vivax in the Peruvian Amazon has risen in the past 5 years. This study
tested the hypothesis that the maintenance and emergence of malaria in
hypoendemic regions such as Amazonia is determined by submicroscopic and
asymptomatic Plasmodium parasitaemia carriers. The present study aimed to
precisely quantify the rate of very-low parasitaemia carriers in two sites of the
Peruvian Amazon in relation to transmission patterns of P. vivax and P.
falciparum in this area.
METHODS: This study was carried out within the Amazonian-ICEMR longitudinal
cohort. Blood samples were collected for light microscopy diagnosis and packed
red blood cell (PRBC) samples were analysed by qPCR. Plasma samples were tested
for total IgG reactivity against recombinant PvMSP-10 and PfMSP-10 antigens by
ELISA. Occupation and age 10 years and greater were considered surrogates of
occupation-related mobility. Risk factors for P. falciparum and P. vivax
infections detected by PRBC-qPCR were assessed by multilevel logistic regression 
models.
RESULTS: Among 450 subjects, the prevalence of P. vivax by PRBC-PCR (25.1%) was
sixfold higher than that determined by microscopy (3.6%). The prevalence of P.
falciparum infection was 4.9% by PRBC-PCR and 0.2% by microscopy. More than 40%
of infections had parasitaemia under 5 parasites/μL. Multivariate analysis for
infections detected by PRBC-PCR showed that participants with recent settlement
in the study area (AOR 2.1; 95% CI 1.03:4.2), age ≥ 30 years (AOR 3.3; 95% CI
1.6:6.9) and seropositivity to P. vivax (AOR 1.8; 95% CI 1.0:3.2) had
significantly higher likelihood of P. vivax infection, while the odds of P.
falciparum infection was higher for participants between 10 and 29 years (AOR
10.7; 95% CI 1.3:91.1) and with a previous P. falciparum infection (AOR 10.4; 95%
CI 1.5:71.1).
CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the contrasting transmission patterns of P.
vivax and P. falciparum in the Peruvian Amazon, with stable local transmission
for P. vivax and the source of P. falciparum to the study villages dominated by
very low parasitaemia carriers, age 10 years and older, who had travelled away
from home for work and brought P. falciparum infection with them.

BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) malaria infection is suspected to cause
endemic Burkitt Lymphoma (eBL), but the evidence remains unsettled. An inverse
relationship between sickle cell trait (SCT) and eBL, which supports that between
malaria and eBL, has been reported before, but in small studies with low power.
We investigated this hypothesis in children in a population-based study in
northern Uganda using Mendelian Randomization.
METHODS: Malaria-related polymorphisms (SCT, IL10, IL1A, CD36, SEMA3C, and
IFNAR1) were genotyped in 202 eBL cases and 624 controls enrolled during
2010-2015. We modeled associations between genotypes and eBL or malaria using
logistic regression.
FINDINGS: SCT was associated with decreased risk of eBL (adjusted odds ratio [OR]
0·37, 95% CI 0·21-0·66; p=0·0003). Decreased risk of eBL was associated with IL10
rs1800896-CT (OR 0·73, 95% CI 0·50-1·07) and -CC genotypes (OR 0·53, 95% CI
0·29-0·95, ptrend=0·019); IL1A rs2856838-AG (OR 0·56, 95% CI 0·39-0·81) and -AA
genotype (OR 0·50, 95% CI 0·28-1·01, ptrend=0·0016); and SEMA3C rs4461841-CT or
-CC genotypes (OR 0·57, 95% CI 0·35-0·93, p=0·0193). SCT and IL10 rs1800896, IL1A
rs2856838, but not SEMA3C rs4461841, polymorphisms were associated with decreased
risk of malaria in the controls.
INTERPRETATION: Our results support a causal effect of malaria infection on eBL.

Health Statistics, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.

Background: Toxocariasis results from infection with larval stages of a dog and
cat intestinal nematode and causes human morbidity. The current United States
estimate of Toxocara exposure is 13.9% (National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey [NHANES] III [1988-1994]).
Methods: We used a multiplex bead-based assay (Tc-CTL-1MBA) with purified
Toxocara canis antigen to estimate Toxocara antibody seroprevalence in serum of
13 509 persons aged ≥6 years from NHANES 2011-2014 and identified seropositivity 
risk factors. We tested a subset of 500 samples with the T. canis enzyme
immunoassay used in NHANES III to estimate prior seroprevalence had samples from 
NHANES III been tested by Tc-CTL-1MBA.
Results: The age-standardized estimate of Toxocara seroprevalence was 5.0% (95%
confidence interval [CI], 4.2%-5.8%), lower than previously reported even after
adjusting for increased Tc-CTL-1MBA specificity. Risk factors for seropositivity 
from multiple logistic regression were older age, non-Hispanic black/Hispanic
origin, male sex, living below poverty level, households with ≥0.5 persons per
room, less than college education, and birth outside of the United States.
Conclusions: Toxocara seroprevalence estimates in 2011-2014 were lower than in a 
study from NHANES III (1988-1994), but seropositivity risk factors remained the
same and should continue to be the focus of prevention efforts.

BACKGROUND: There is a growing concern about child mortality especially in
developing countries. The Government of Tanzania and non-governmental
organizations are fighting against diseases like malaria, anaemia, diarrhoea and 
pneumonia that contribute extensively to child mortality. This was a
hospital-based, retrospective cohort study involving 1130 under-fives (excluding 
neonates) being either discharged from or died in public hospitals of the Lake
Zone in Tanzania. We extracted information on symptoms and signs at admission,
major diagnoses and causes of death from the medical records. We applied binary
logistic regression models to assess risk factors associated with in-patient
under-five death.
RESULTS: The major leading morbidities include malaria (49%), anemia (37%),
diarrhea (27%), pneumonia (22%) and severe acute malnutrition (21%). We found the
case fatality of 74 deaths per 1000 under-five admissions. Major underlying
causes of deaths were severe anaemia, severe malaria and severe pneumonia.
Factors associated with in-patient death were female sex (AOR 1.7; 95% CI 1.0,
2.8) and the odds significantly decreased with increasing level of maternal
education.
CONCLUSIONS: Malaria remains a leading cause of admissions in hospitals among
under-fives. Although the case fatality among children aged between 2 and
59 months admitted in hospitals in Lake Zone is decreasing, efforts are needed to
address major causes of deaths (severe anaemia, severe malaria and severe
pneumonia).

We studied associations between delayed care seeking, demographic, socioeconomic,
and geographic factors and likelihood of severe malaria in Ugandan children. The 
study was based at Jinja Hospital, Uganda. We enrolled 325 severe malaria cases
and 325 uncomplicated malaria controls matched by age and residence. Patient
details, an itinerary of events in response to illness, household information,
and location of participants' residences were captured. Conditional logistic
regression was used to determine risk factors for severe malaria and delayed care
seeking. Delayed care seeking (≥ 24 hours after fever onset; odds ratio [OR]
5.50; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.70, 11.1), seeking care at a drug shop as
the initial response to illness (OR 3.62; 95% CI 1.86, 7.03), and increasing
distance from place of residence to the nearest health center (OR 1.45; 95% CI
1.17, 1.79) were independent risk factors for severe malaria. On subgroup
analysis, delayed care seeking was a significant risk factor in children with
severe malaria attributable to severe anemia (OR 15.6; 95% CI 3.02, 80.6), but
not unconsciousness (OR 1.13; 95% CI 0.30, 4.28). Seeking care at a drug shop (OR
2.84; 95% CI 1.12, 7.21) and increasing distance to the nearest health center (OR
1.18; 95% CI 1.01, 1.37) were independent risk factors for delayed care seeking. 
Delayed care seeking and seeking care at a drug shop were risk factors for severe
malaria. Seeking care at a drug shop was also a predictor of delayed care
seeking. The role of drug shops in contributing to delayed care and risk of
severe malaria requires further study.

Anemia is common during pregnancy and is associated with poor outcomes.
Objectives were not only 1) to determine the prevalence of anemia and iron
deficiency (ID) but also 2) to identify other factors associated with anemia in
pregnant women from South Kivu province, in the eastern Democratic Republic of
Congo. Between December 2013 and March 2014, 531 women attending the first
antenatal visit in their second trimester of pregnancy were recruited.
Sociodemographic, clinical, and biological data were collected. Hemoglobin (Hb)
was determined by a portable photometer (Hemocue® Hb201+), and anemia was defined
as altitude-adjusted Hb < 110 g/L. ID was defined as serum ferritin < 15 μg/L
adjusted for inflammation status (C-reactive protein [CRP] > 5 mg/L and/or
α-1-acid glycoprotein > 1 g/L) whereas hypoalbuminemia was defined as serum
albumin < 35 g/L. A Giemsa-stained blood smear was used to diagnose malaria. The 
median age (interquartile range ) was 25.5 (21.1-31.3) years, with anemia in
17.6% and ID in 8%. Malaria was present in 7.5% and hypoalbuminemia among 44%.
Soluble transferrin receptor concentration was higher in the presence of
inflammation and/or malaria. In the final logistic regression model, factors
independently associated with anemia were malaria (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]:
11.24 (4.98-25.37) P < 0.001), hypoalbuminemia [aOR: 2.14 (1.27-3.59); P = 0.004]
and elevated CRP [aOR: 1.94 (1.10-3.45); P = 0.022]. ID was not highly prevalent 
and not associated with anemia in our population. Effective control of anemia
during pregnancy in this region should consider fighting malaria and other
infectious diseases in combination with measures to improve women's nutrition,
both before and during pregnancy.

BACKGROUND: Transplacental transfer of maternal immunoglobulin G (IgG) to the
fetus helps to protect against malaria and other infections in infancy. Recent
studies have emphasized the important role of malaria-specific IgG3 in malaria
immunity, and its transfer may reduce the risk of malaria in infancy. Human IgGs 
are actively transferred across the placenta by binding the neonatal Fc receptor 
(FcRn) expressed within the endosomes of the syncytiotrophoblastic membrane.
Histidine at position 435 (H435) provides for optimal Fc-IgG binding. In contrast
to other IgG subclasses, IgG3 is highly polymorphic and usually contains an
arginine at position 435, which reduces its binding affinity to FcRn in vitro.
The reduced binding to FcRn is associated with reduced transplacental transfer
and reduced half-life of IgG3 in vivo. Some haplotypes of IgG3 have histidine at 
position 435. This study examines the hypotheses that the IgG3-H435 variant
promotes increased transplacental transfer of malaria-specific antibodies and a
prolonged IgG3 half-life in infants and that its presence correlates with
protection against clinical malaria during infancy.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: In Benin, 497 mother-infant pairs were included in a
longitudinal birth cohort. Both maternal and cord serum samples were assayed for 
levels of IgG1 and IgG3 specific for MSP119, MSP2 (both allelic families, 3D7 and
FC27), MSP3, GLURP (both regions, R0 and R2), and AMA1 antigens of Plasmodium
falciparum. Cord:maternal ratios were calculated. The maternal IgG3 gene was
sequenced to identify the IgG3-H435 polymorphism. A multivariate logistic
regression was used to examine the association between maternal IgG3-H435
polymorphism and transplacental transfer of IgG3, adjusting for
hypergammaglobulinemia, maternal malaria, and infant malaria exposure.
Twenty-four percent of Beninese women living in an area highly endemic for
malaria had the IgG3-H435 allele (377 women homozygous for the IgG3-R435 allele, 
117 women heterozygous for the IgG3-R/H alleles, and 3 women homozygous for the
IgG3-H435 allele). Women with the IgG3-H435 allele had a 78% (95% CI 17%, 170%, p
= 0.007) increased transplacental transfer of GLURP-R2 IgG3 compared to those
without the IgG3-H435 allele. Furthermore, in infants born to mothers with the
IgG3-H435 variant, a 28% longer IgG3 half-life was noted (95% CI 4%, 59%, p =
0.02) compared to infants born to mothers homozygous for the IgG3-R435 allele.
Similar findings were observed for AMA1, MSP2-3D7, MSP3, GLURP-R0, and GLURP-R2
but not for MSP119 and MSP2-FC27. Infants born to women with IgG3-H435 had a 32% 
lower risk of symptomatic malaria during infancy (incidence rate ratio [IRR] =
0.68 [95% CI 0.51, 0.91], p = 0.01) compared to infants born to mothers
homozygous for IgG3-R435. We did not find a lower risk of asymptomatic malaria in
infants born to women with or without IgG3-H435. Limitations of the study were
the inability to determine (i) the actual amount of IgG3-H435 relative to
IgG-R435 in serum samples and (ii) the proportion of malaria-specific IgG
produced by infants versus acquired from their mothers.
CONCLUSIONS: An arginine-to-histidine replacement at residue 435 in the binding
domain of IgG3 to FcRn increases the transplacental transfer and half-life of
malaria-specific IgG3 in young infants and is associated with reduced risk of
clinical malaria during infancy. The IgG3-H435 allele may be under positive
selection, given its relatively high frequency in malaria endemic areas.

Malaria control intervention coverage increased nationwide in Malawi during
2000-2010. Trends in intervention coverage were assessed against trends in
malaria parasite prevalence, severe anemia (hemoglobin < 8 g/dL), and all-cause
mortality in children under 5 years of age (ACCM) using nationally representative
household surveys. Associations between insecticide-treated net (ITN) ownership, 
malaria morbidity, and ACCM were also assessed. Household ITN ownership increased
from 27.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 25.9-29.0) in 2004 to 56.8% (95% CI = 
55.6-58.1) in 2010. Similarly intermittent preventive treatment during pregnancy 
coverage increased from 28.2% (95% CI = 26.7-29.8) in 2000 to 55.0% (95% CI =
53.4-56.6) in 2010. Malaria parasite prevalence decreased significantly from
60.5% (95% CI = 53.0-68.0) in 2001 to 20.4% (95% CI = 15.7-25.1) in 2009 in
children aged 6-35 months. Severe anemia prevalence decreased from 20.4% (95% CI:
17.3-24.0) in 2004 to 13.1% (95% CI = 11.0-15.4) in 2010 in children aged 6-23
months. ACCM decreased 41%, from 188.6 deaths per 1,000 live births (95% CI =
179.1-198.0) during 1996-2000, to 112.1 deaths per 1,000 live births (95% CI =
105.8-118.5) during 2006-2010. When controlling for other covariates in random
effects logistic regression models, household ITN ownership was protective
against malaria parasitemia in children (odds ratio [OR] = 0.81, 95% CI =
0.72-0.92) and severe anemia (OR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.72-0.94). After considering
the magnitude of changes in malaria intervention coverage and nonmalaria factors,
and given the contribution of malaria to all-cause mortality in malaria-endemic
countries, the substantial increase in malaria control interventions likely
improved child survival in Malawi during 2000-2010.

BACKGROUND: A recent considerable decline in malaria morbidity and mortality in
Ethiopia is likely to be followed by changes in the practice of effective
preventive measures and malaria risk factors. This study aimed to identify
determinants of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) ownership and risk of
malaria infection.
METHODS: A matched case-control study of 191 case and 377 control households was 
conducted between October 2014 and November 2015 in Adami Tullu district in
south-central Ethiopia. Cases were microscopy or rapid diagnostic test confirmed 
malaria patients identified at three health centers and nine health posts, and
matched on age with two neighbourhood controls. Information was collected on
socio-demographic factors, house structure, knowledge on malaria and ownership of
LLINs. The logistic regression model was used to determine predictors of LLINs
ownership and malaria infection.
RESULTS: All cases were infections due to either Plasmodium falciparum (71.2%) or
Plasmodium vivax (28.8%). About 31% of the study households had at least one
LLINs. Significant determinants of LLINs ownership were household's head malaria 
knowledge [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.47, 95% confidence interval (CI)
1.44-4.22], educational status [read and write (AOR = 6.88, 95% CI 2.30-20.55),
primary education or higher (AOR = 5.40, 95% CI 1.57-18.55)], farmer respondent
(AOR = 0.35, 95% CI 0.17-0.76), having ≥ 3 sleeping areas (AOR = 6.71, 95% CI
2.40-18.77) and corrugated roof type (AOR = 2.49, 95% CI 1.36-4.58). This study
was unable to identify important risk factors of malaria infection with regard to
sex, household wealth index, house structure, ownership of LLINs, keeping
livestock inside house, staying overnight outdoor or having malaria during the
last 6 months.
CONCLUSIONS: Household socio-economic status, educational status and knowledge on
malaria were important predictors of LLINs ownership. Households with farmer
respondents were less likely to own LLINs. Addressing these factors could improve
household's ownership of LLINs. The importance of factors associated with malaria
infection was less evident in the current low transmission setting, and
necessitates further epidemiological study.

Objective: We assessed the prevalence of malarial fever and its association with 
demographic and socioeconomic factors in children <5 years of age.
Methods: Using the data of Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey (PDHS), the
socioeconomic condition (SEC) was assessed by using a household wealth index as a
proxy indicator, generated through principal component analysis. Two-stage
sampling was used for selection of households, and multilevel logistic regression
analysis was performed.
Results: The PDHS contains 10 935 children <5 years of age with valid information
about malaria fever. In total, 36% (3930) children have malaria 2 weeks before
the survey. A decreasing trend in prevalence of malaria fever was found with
increasing SEC. Compared with SEC Quintile V, children of SEC Quintile I were
more likely to get fever [adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=1.40 (1.15-1.69)] and of SEC 
Quintile II [AOR = 1.23 (1.03-1.45)].
Conclusion: SEC has a significant impact on the prevalence of malaria fever in
the context of different regions in Pakistan.

BACKGROUND: Long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) are a key malaria control
intervention. Although LLINs are presumed to be effective for 3 years under field
or programmatic conditions, net care and repair approaches by users influence the
physical and chemical durability. Understanding how knowledge, perception and
practices influence net care and repair practices could guide the development of 
targeted behavioural change communication interventions related to net care and
repair in Ethiopia and elsewhere.
METHODS: This population-based, household survey was conducted in four regions of
Ethiopia [Amhara, Oromia, Tigray, Southern Nations Nationalities Peoples Region
(SNNPR)] in June 2015. A total of 1839 households were selected using multi-stage
sampling procedures. The household respondents were the heads of households. A
questionnaire was administered and the data were captured electronically. STATA
software version 12 was used to analyse the data. Survey commands were used to
account for the multi-stage sampling approach. Household descriptive statistics
related to characteristics and levels of knowledge and perception on net care and
repair are presented. Ordinal logistic regression was used to identify factors
associated with net care and repair perceptions.
RESULTS: Less than a quarter of the respondents (22.3%: 95% CI 20.4-24.3%)
reported adequate knowledge of net care and repair; 24.6% (95% CI 22.7-26.5%) of 
the respondents reported receiving information on net care and repair in the
previous 6 months. Thirty-five per cent of the respondents (35.1%: 95% CI
32.9-37.4%) reported positive perceptions towards net care and repair.
Respondents with adequate knowledge on net care and repair (AOR 1.58: 95% CI
1.2-2.02), and those who discussed net care and repair with their family (AOR
1.47: 95% CI 1.14-1.89) had higher odds of having positive perceptions towards
net care and repair.
CONCLUSIONS: The low level of reported knowledge on net care and repair, as well 
as the low level of reported positive perception towards net repair need to be
addressed. Targeted behavioural change communication campaigns could be used to
target specific groups; increased net care and repair would lead to longer
lasting nets.

BACKGROUND: Long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) are a cornerstone of malaria
prevention. Holes develop in LLINs over time and compromise their physical
integrity, but how holes affect malaria transmission risk is not well known.
METHODS: After a nationwide mass LLIN distribution in July 2012, a study was
conducted to assess the relationship between LLIN damage and malaria. From March 
to September 2013, febrile children ages 6-59 months who consistently slept under
LLINs (every night for 2 weeks before illness onset) were enrolled in a
case-control study at Machinga District Hospital outpatient department. Cases
were positive for Plasmodium falciparum asexual parasites by microscopy while
controls were negative. Digital photographs of participants' LLINs were analysed 
using an image-processing programme to measure holes. Total hole area was
classified by quartiles and according to the World Health Organization's
proportionate hole index (pHI) cut-offs [< 79 cm2 (good), 80-789 cm2 (damaged),
and > 790 cm2 (too torn)]. Number of holes by location and size, and total hole
area, were compared between case and control LLINs using non-parametric analyses 
and logistic regression.
RESULTS: Of 248 LLINs analysed, 97 (39%) were from cases. Overall, 86% of LLINs
had at least one hole. The median number of holes of any size was 9
[interquartile range (IQR) 3, 22], and most holes were located in the lower
halves of the nets [median 7 (IQR 2, 16)]. There were no differences in number or
location of holes between LLINs used by cases and controls. The median total hole
area was 10 cm2 (IQR 2, 125) for control LLINs and 8 cm2 (IQR 2, 47) for case
LLINs (p = 0.10). Based on pHI, 109 (72%) control LLINs and 83 (86%) case LLINs
were in "good" condition. Multivariable modeling showed no association between
total hole area and malaria, controlling for child age, caregiver education, and 
iron versus thatched roof houses.
CONCLUSIONS: LLIN holes were not associated with increased odds of malaria in
this study. However, most of the LLINs were in relatively good condition 1 year
after distribution. Future studies should examine associations between LLIN holes
and malaria risk with more damaged nets.

Anopheles arabiensis (Patton; Diptera: Culicidae) is a major malaria vector in
the southern African region. In South Africa, effective control of this species
using indoor-based interventions is reduced owing to its tendency to rest
outdoors. As South Africa moves towards malaria elimination there is a need for
complementary vector control strategies. One of the methods under consideration
is the use of the sterile insect technique (SIT). Key to the successful
implementation of an SIT programme is prior knowledge of the size and spatial
distribution of the target population. Understanding mosquito population dynamics
for both males and females is critical for efficient programme implementation. It
is thus necessary to use outdoor-based population monitoring tools capable of
sampling both sexes of the target population. In this project mosquito
surveillance and evaluation of tools capable of collecting both genders were
carried out at Mamfene in northern KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa, during
the period January 2014 to December 2015. Outdoor- and indoor-resting Anopheles
mosquitoes were sampled in three sections of Mamfene over the 2-yr sampling
period using modified plastic buckets, clay pots and window exit traps.
Morphological and molecular techniques were used for species identifications of
all samples. Wild-caught adult females were tested for Plasmodium falciparum
(Welch; Haemosporida: Plasmodiidae) infectivity. Out of 1,705 mosquitoes
collected, 1,259 (73.8%) and 255 (15%) were identified as members of either the
Anopheles gambiae complex or Anopheles funestus group respectively. An.
arabiensis was the most abundant species contributing 78.8% of identified
specimens. Mosquito density was highest in summer and lowest during winter. Clay 
pots yielded 16.3 mosquitoes per trap compared to 10.5 for modified plastic
buckets over the 2-yr sampling period. P. falciparum infection rates for An.
arabiensis were 0.7% and 0.5% for 2014 and 2015, respectively. Logistic
regression analysis showed an association between An. arabiensis catches with
Section and season of collection but not with sex and collection methods. These
data confirmed the presence of a perennial An. arabiensis population at Mamfene
and constitute the first records of P. falciparum infective An. arabiensis from
South Africa, confirming this species as a major vector in the malaria endemic
provinces of the country.

BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum infections are especially severe in pregnant
women because infected erythrocytes (IE) express VAR2CSA, a ligand that binds to 
placental trophoblasts, causing IE to accumulate in the placenta. Resulting
inflammation and pathology increases a woman's risk of anemia, miscarriage,
premature deliveries, and having low birthweight (LBW) babies. Antibodies (Ab) to
VAR2CSA reduce placental parasitaemia and improve pregnancy outcomes. Currently, 
no single assay is able to predict if a woman has adequate immunity to prevent
placental malaria (PM). This study measured Ab levels to 28 malarial antigens and
used the data to develop statistical models for predicting if a woman has
sufficient immunity to prevent PM.
METHODS: Archival plasma samples from 1377 women were screened in a bead-based
multiplex assay for Ab to 17 VAR2CSA-associated antigens (full length VAR2CSA
(FV2), DBL 1-6 of the FCR3, 3D7 and 7G8 lines, ID1-ID2a (FCR3 and 3D7) and 11
antigens that have been reported to be associated with immunity to P. falciparum 
(AMA-1, CSP, EBA-175, LSA1, MSP1, MSP2, MSP3, MSP11, Pf41, Pf70 and RESA)). Ab
levels along with clinical variables (age, gravidity) were used in the following 
seven statistical approaches: logistic regression full model, logistic regression
reduced model, recursive partitioning, random forests, linear discriminant
analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis, and support vector machine.
RESULTS: The best and simplest model proved to be the logistic regression reduced
model. AMA-1, MSP2, EBA-175, Pf41, and MSP11 were found to be the top five most
important predictors for the PM status based on overall prediction performance.
CONCLUSIONS: Not surprising, significant differences were observed between PM
positive (PM+) and PM negative (PM-) groups for Ab levels to the majority of
malaria antigens. Individually though, these malarial antigens did not achieve
reasonably high performances in terms of predicting the PM status. Utilizing
multiple antigens in predictive models considerably improved discrimination power
compared to individual assays. Among seven different classifiers considered, the 
reduced logistic regression model produces the best overall predictive
performance.

Background Higher cumulative burden of viral and bacterial pathogens may increase
the risk of stroke, but the contribution of parasitic infections in relation to
cumulative pathogen burden and risk of stroke has rarely been examined. Aim To
estimate the association of multiple persistent viral and parasitic infections
with stroke in a representative sample of adults in the United States. Methods
Serological evidence of prior infection was categorized as positive for 0-1, 2,
3, or 4-5 infections based on immunoglobulin G seropositivity to cytomegalovirus,
hepatitis A virus, hepatitis B virus, Toxoplasma gondii, and Toxocara spp. in
13,904 respondents from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III.
Regression analysis was used to estimate the cross-sectional association between 
serological evidence of prior infection and history of stroke adjusting for
demographic risk factors, and potential mediators of stroke. Results Age-adjusted
models that included serological evidence of prior infection to cytomegalovirus, 
hepatitis A virus, hepatitis B virus, Toxoplasma gondii, and Toxocara spp. showed
that adults in the highest serological evidence of prior infection category (4-5 
infections) had a higher prevalence of stroke (5.50%, 95% confidence interval
2.44-10.46%) than those in the lowest serological evidence of prior infection
categories (1.49%, 95% confidence interval 1.01-2.11%), and a trend test
suggested a graded association between serological evidence of prior infection
and stroke ( p = 0.02). In multivariable logistic regression models, the positive
association of serological evidence of prior infection with stroke prevalence
remained significant after adjustment for other significant risk factors (odds
ratio = 1.4, p = 0.01) but was only significant among those aged 20-59 (odds
ratio = 2.0, p = 0.005) and not among those aged 60-69 ( p = 0.78) or 70 and
older ( p = 0.43). Conclusion We found support for a connection between
serological evidence of prior infection to cytomegalovirus, hepatitis A virus,
hepatitis B virus, Toxoplasma gondii, and Toxocara spp. and stroke among those
aged 20-59. There may be a need to consider common parasitic infections in
addition to viral and bacterial pathogens when calculating serological evidence
of prior infection in relation to cerebrovascular disease.

BACKGROUND: Malaria accounts for ~21% of outpatient visits annually in Kenya;
prompt and accurate malaria diagnosis is critical to ensure proper treatment. In 
2013, formal malaria microscopy refresher training for microscopists and a pilot 
quality-assurance (QA) programme for malaria diagnostics were independently
implemented to improve malaria microscopy diagnosis in malaria low-transmission
areas of Kenya. A study was conducted to identify factors associated with malaria
microscopy performance in the same areas.
METHODS: From March to April 2014, a cross-sectional survey was conducted in 42
public health facilities; 21 were QA-pilot facilities. In each facility, 18
malaria thick blood slides archived during January-February 2014 were selected by
simple random sampling. Each malaria slide was re-examined by two expert
microscopists masked to health-facility results. Expert results were used as the 
reference for microscopy performance measures. Logistic regression with specific 
random effects modelling was performed to identify factors associated with
accurate malaria microscopy diagnosis.
RESULTS: Of 756 malaria slides collected, 204 (27%) were read as positive by
health-facility microscopists and 103 (14%) as positive by experts. Overall, 93% 
of slide results from QA-pilot facilities were concordant with expert reference
compared to 77% in non-QA pilot facilities (p < 0.001). Recently trained
microscopists in QA-pilot facilities performed better on microscopy performance
measures with 97% sensitivity and 100% specificity compared to those in non-QA
pilot facilities (69% sensitivity; 93% specificity; p < 0.01). The overall
inter-reader agreement between QA-pilot facilities and experts was κ = 0.80 (95% 
CI 0.74-0.88) compared to κ = 0.35 (95% CI 0.24-0.46) between non-QA pilot
facilities and experts (p < 0.001). In adjusted multivariable logistic regression
analysis, recent microscopy refresher training (prevalence ratio [PR] = 13.8; 95%
CI 4.6-41.4), ≥5 years of work experience (PR = 3.8; 95% CI 1.5-9.9), and pilot
QA programme participation (PR = 4.3; 95% CI 1.0-11.0) were significantly
associated with accurate malaria diagnosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Microscopists who had recently completed refresher training and
worked in a QA-pilot facility performed the best overall. The QA programme and
formal microscopy refresher training should be systematically implemented
together to improve parasitological diagnosis of malaria by microscopy in Kenya.

BACKGROUND: Long-distance truck drivers are occupationally susceptible to poor
health outcomes. Their patterns of healthcare utilisation and the suitability of 
healthcare services available to them are not well documented. We report on truck
driver healthcare utilisation across South Africa and characterise the client
population of the clinics serving them for future service development.
METHODS: We analysed anonymised data routinely collected over a two-year period
at nine Roadside Wellness Centres. Associations between services accessed and
socio-demographic characteristics were assessed using univariable and
multivariable logistic regression models.
RESULTS: We recorded 16,688 visits by 13,252 individual truck drivers (average of
1.26 visits/person) who accessed 17,885 services for an average of 1.07
services/visit and 1.35 services/person. The mean age of truck drivers was
39 years. Sixty-seven percent reported being in stable relationships. The most
accessed services were primary healthcare (PHC)(62%) followed by HIV (32%). Low
proportions (≤6%) accessed STI,TB and malaria services. Most visits were
characterised by only one service being accessed (93%, n = 15,523/16,688). Of the
remaining 7% of visits, up to five services were accessed per visit and the
combination of TB /HIV services in one visit remained extremely low (<1%,
n = 14/16,688). Besides PHC services at the beginning of the reporting period,
all service categories displayed similar seasonal utilisation trends(i.e. service
utilisation peaked in the immediate few months post clinics opening and
substantially decreased before holidays). Across all service categories, younger 
truck drivers, those with a stable partner currently, and those of South African 
origin were the main clinic attendees. Older truck drivers (≥40 years) were more 
likely to access TB and PHC services, yet less likely to access HIV and STI
services. Those with stable partners were less likely to access STI and TB
services but more likely to access malaria and PHC services. South African
attendees were more likely to access PHC, while attendees from other
nationalities were more likely to access HIV and malaria services.
CONCLUSIONS: This utilisation analysis shows that tailored services assist in
alleviating healthcare access challenges faced by truck drivers, but it
underscores the importance of ensuring that service packages and clinics speak to
truck drivers' needs in terms of services offered and clinic location.

Brasília, Brazil.

Objective: To identify factors associated with timely treatment of malaria in the
Brazilian Amazon. Malaria, despite being treatable, has proven difficult to
control and continues to be an important public health problem globally. Brazil
accounted for almost half of the 427 000 new malaria cases notified in the
Americas in 2013.
Methods: This was a cross-sectional study using secondary data on all notified
malaria cases for the period from 2004 - 2013. Timely treatment was considered to
be all treatment started within 24 hours of symptoms onset. Multivariate logistic
regression was used to identify independent factors associated with timely
treatment.
Results: The proportion of cases starting treatment on a timely basis was 41.1%, 
tending to increase in more recent years (OR = 1.40; 95%CI: 1.37 - 1.42 in 2013).
Furthermore, people starting within < 24 hours were more likely to: reside in the
states of Rondônia (OR = 1.50; 95%CI: 1.49 - 1.51) or Acre (OR = 1.53; 95%CI:
1.55 - 1.57); be 0 - 5 years of age (OR = 1.39; 95%CI: 1.34 - 1.44) or 6 - 14
years of age (OR = 1.34; 95%CI: 1.32 - 1.36); be indigenous (OR = 1.41; 95%CI:
1.37 - 1.45); have a low level of schooling (OR = 1.20; 95%CI: 1.19 - 1.22); and 
be diagnosed by active detection (OR = 1.39; 95%CI: 1.38 - 1.39).
Conclusion: In the Brazilian Amazon area, individuals were more likely to have
timely treatment of malaria if they were young, residing in Acre or Rondônia
states, have little schooling, and be identified through active detection.
Identifying groups vulnerable to late treatment is important for preventing
severe cases and malaria deaths.

BACKGROUND: Continuous distribution of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) has now
been accepted as one way of sustaining ITN universal coverage. Community-based
channels offer an interesting means of delivering ITNs to households to sustain
universal ITN coverage. The objective of this study was to provide proof of
concept for this channel.
METHODS: A 9-month, community-based, distribution pilot was implemented beginning
1 year after a mass campaign in Lainya County, South Sudan from 2012 to 2013.
Following social mobilization, community members could request an ITN from a net 
coupon holder. Eligibility criteria included having lost an ITN, giving birth
outside of the health facility, or not having enough ITNs for all household
members. After verification, households could exchange the coupon for an ITN at a
distribution point. The evaluation was a pre/post design using representative
household surveys with two-stage cluster sampling and a sample size of 600
households per survey.
RESULTS: At endline, 78% of respondents were aware of the scheme and 89% of those
also received an ITN through community-based distribution. Population access to
ITNs nearly doubled, from 38% at baseline to 66% after the pilot. Household
ownership of any ITN and enough ITNs (1 for 2 people) also increased
significantly, from 66 to 82% and 19 to 46%, respectively. Community-based
distribution was the only source of ITNs for 53.4% of households. The proportion 
of the population using an ITN last night increased from 22.7% at baseline to
53.9% at endline. A logistic regression model indicates that although behaviour
change communication was positively associated with an increase in ITN use,
access to enough nets was the greatest determinant of use.
CONCLUSIONS: ITN access and use improved significantly in the study area during
the pilot, coming close to universal coverage targets. This pilot serves as proof
of concept for the community-based distribution methodology implemented as a
mechanism to sustain ITN universal coverage. Longer periods of implementation
should be evaluated to determine whether community-based distribution can
successfully maintain ITN coverage beyond the short term, and reach all wealth
quintiles equitably.

BACKGROUND: Evidence of insecticide resistance has been documented in different
malaria endemic areas. Surveillance studies to allow prompt investigation of
associated factors to enable effective insecticide resistance management are
needed. The objective of this study was to assess insecticide use pattern and
phenotypic susceptibility level of Anopheles gambiae sensu lato to insecticides
commonly used in malaria control in Moshi, northern Tanzania.
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted to assess insecticide usage
pattern. Data was collected was through closed and open ended questionnaires The 
WHO diagnostic standard kit with doses of 0.1% bendiocarb, 0.05% deltamethrin,
0.75% permethrin and 4% DDT were used to detect knockdown time, mortality and
resistance ratio of wild A. gambiae sensu lato. The questionnaire survey data was
analyzed using descriptive statistics and one-way analysis of variance while
susceptibility data was analysed by logistic regression with probit analysis
using SPSS program. The WHO criteria was used to evaluate the resistance status
of the tested mosquito populations.
RESULTS: A large proportion of respondents (80.8%) reported to have used
insecticide mainly for farming purposes (77.3%). Moreover, 93.3% of household
reported usage of long lasting insecticidal nets. The frequently used class of
insecticide was organophosphate with chloropyrifos as the main active ingredients
and dursban was the brand constantly reported. Very few respondents (24.1%)
applied integrated vector control approaches of and this significantly associated
with level of knowledge of insecticide use (P < 0.001). Overall knockdown time
for A. gambiae s.l was highest in DDT, followed by Pyrethroids (Permethrin and
deltamethrin) and lowest in bendiocarb. Anopheles gambiae s.l showed
susceptibility to bendiocarb, increased tolerance to permethrin and resistant to 
deltamethrin. The most effective insecticide against the population from tested
was bendiocarb, with a resistance ratio ranging between 0.93-2.81.
CONCLUSION: Education on integrated vector management should be instituted and a 
policy change on insecticide of choice for malaria vector control from
pyrethroids to carbamates (bendiocarb) is recommended. Furthermore, studies to
detect cross resistance between pyrethroids and organophosphates should be
carried out.

BACKGROUND: Ethiopia is a developing country where intestinal helminthic
infections are major public health problems. The burden of intestinal parasites, 
particularly the soil-transmitted helminths (STHs), is often very high in school 
children and pregnant women. Anemia, associated with STH, is a major factor in
women's health, especially during pregnancy; it is an important contributor to
maternal mortality. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of
intestinal helminthic infection and anemia among pregnant women attending ANC in 
East Wollega Zone, Ethiopia.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in five health centers of East
Wollega Zone of Oromia Region, Ethiopia between November 2015 and January 2016.
The health centers were selected randomly and study participants were enrolled
consecutively with proportions from all the health centers. Stool and blood
specimens were processed using standard operating procedures in accordance with
structured questionnaires. Logistic regression models were applied to assess the 
association between predictors and outcome variables. P values less than 0.05
were taken as significant levels. Results were presented in tables and figures.
RESULTS: A total of 372 pregnant women were enrolled in this study with a median 
age of 25 years (range 17-40 years). The total prevalence of intestinal helminths
was 24.7% (92/372) with the predominance of Hookworm (15.1%) followed by Ascaris 
lumbricoides (6.5%). Illiteracy [AOR, 95% CI 2.21 (1.3, 4.8), P = 0.042], absence
of latrine [AOR, 95% CI 4.62 (1.7, 8.3), P = 0.013] and regular consumption of
raw and/or unwashed fruit [AOR, 95% CI 3.30 (1.2, 6.3), P = 0.011] were
significant predictors of intestinal helminthic infection. The overall prevalence
of anemia was 17.5% (65/372) where mild anemia accounts for 80% of the total
anemia. Anemia was significantly associated with the first trimester of gestation
[AOR, 95% CI 2.82 (1.3, 6.2), P = 0.009], previous malaria infection [AOR, 95% CI
2.32 (1.3, 5.3), P = 0.003], failing to take iron supplements regularly [AOR, 95%
CI 1.82 (1.1, 4.8), P = 0.022] and infection with intestinal helminths
specifically with Hookworm (P = 0.001) and Ascaris lumbricoides (P = 0.022).
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of intestinal helminths and anemia was significantly
high in this study. Different socio-demographic, lifestyle and obstetric factors 
were identified as significant contributors of intestinal helminthic infection
and anemia among pregnant women. Therefore, public health measures and intensive 
antenatal care services are vital to promoting safe pregnancy.

BACKGROUND: Madagascar conducted the first two phases of a national free mass
distribution campaign of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) during a
political crisis in 2009 aiming to achieve coverage of two LLINs per household as
part of the National Malaria Control Strategy. The campaign targeted households
in 19 out of 91 total health districts.
METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional household survey using a three-stage
cluster sample design was conducted four months post campaign to assess LLIN
ownership, access and use. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to
identify factors associated with household LLIN access and individual LLIN use.
RESULTS: A total of 2211 households were surveyed representing 8867 people. At
least one LLIN was present in 93.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 91.6-95.5%) of
households and 74.8% (95% CI, 71.0-78.6%) owned at least two LLINs. Access
measured as the proportion of the population that could potentially be covered by
household-owned LLINs was 77.2% (77.2% (95% CI, 72.9-81.3%) and LLIN use by all
individuals was 84.2% (95% CI, 81.2-87.2%). LLIN use was associated with
knowledge of insecticide treated net use to prevent malaria (OR = 3.58, 95% CI,
1.85-6.94), household ownership of more LLINs (OR 2.82, 95% CI 1.85-4.3),
presence of children under five (OR = 2.05, 95% CI, 1.67-2.51), having traveled
to the distribution point and receiving information about hanging a bednet (OR = 
1.56, 95% CI, 1.41-1.74), and having received a post-campaign visit by a
community mobilizer (OR = 1.75, 95% CI, 1.26-2.43). Lower LLIN use was associated
with increasing household size (OR = 0.81 95% CI 0.77-0.85) and number of
sleeping spaces (OR = 0.55, 95% CI, 0.44-0.68).
CONCLUSIONS: A large scale free mass LLIN distribution campaign was feasible and 
effective at achieving high LLIN access and use in Madagascar. Campaign process
indicators highlighted potential areas for strengthening implementation to
optimize access and equity.

Anemia is a worldwide public health concern especially in preschool children in
developing countries and iron deficiency (ID) is generally assumed to cause at
least 50% of the cases. However, data on this contribution are scarce. To close
this gap, we determined in 2013 the contribution of ID in the etiology of anemia 
and measured others factors associated to noniron deficiency anemia (NIDA) in 900
preschool children randomly selected during a two-stage cluster nutritional
survey in the Miti-Murhesa health zone, in eastern Democratic Republic of the
Congo. In these children, we collected sociodemographic, clinical, and biological
parameters and determined the nutritional status according to the World Health
Organization 2006 standards. Anemia was defined as altitude-adjusted hemoglobin <
110 g/L and ID was defined as serum ferritin < 12 μg/L or < 30 μg/L in the
absence or presence of inflammation, respectively. Median (interquartile range)
age was 29.4 (12-45) months. The prevalence of anemia was 46.6% (391/838) among
whom only 16.5% (62/377) had ID. Among children without signs of inflammation,
only 4.4% (11/251) met the ferritin-based (unadjusted) definition of ID. Logistic
regression analysis identified ID, history of fever during the last 2 weeks and
mid-upper arm circumference < 125 mm as the only independent factors associated
to anemia. In conclusion, anemia is a severe public health problem in the
Miti-Murhesa health zone, but NIDA is mostly predominant and needs to be further 
studied. Control of infections and prevention of acute undernutrition (wasting)
are some of appropriate interventions to reduce the burden anemia in this region.

BACKGROUND: Reactive case detection (RACD) around passively detected malaria
cases is a strategy to identify and treat hotspots of malaria transmission. This 
study investigated the unproven assumption on which this approach is based, that 
in low transmission settings, infections cluster over small scales.
METHODS: A prospective case-control study was conducted between January 2013 and 
August 2014 in Ohangwena and Omusati regions in north central Namibia. Patients
attending health facilities who tested positive by malaria rapid diagnostic test 
(RDT) (index cases) were traced back to their home. All occupants of index case
households (n = 116 households) and surrounding households (n = 225) were
screened for Plasmodium infection with a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and loop
mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and interviewed to identify risk
factors. A comparison group of 286 randomly-selected control households was also 
screened, to compare infection levels of RACD and non-RACD households and their
neighbours. Logistic regression was used to investigate spatial clustering of
patent and sub-patent infections around index cases and to identify potential
risk factors that would inform screening approaches and identify risk groups.
Estimates of the impact of RACD on onward transmission to mosquitoes was made
using previously published figures of infection rates.
RESULTS: Prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum infection by LAMP was 3.4%, 1.4% and
0.4% in index-case households, neighbors of index case households and control
households respectively; adjusted odds ratio 6.1 [95%CI 1.9-19.5] comparing case 
households versus control households. Using data from Engela, neighbors of cases 
had higher odds of infection [adjusted OR 5.0 95%CI 1.3-18.9] compared to control
households. All infections identified by RDTs were afebrile and RDTs identified
only a small proportion of infections in case (n = 7; 17%) and control (0%)
neighborhoods. Based on published estimates of patent and sub-patent
infectiousness, these results suggest that infections missed by RDTs during RACD 
would allow 50-71% of infections to mosquitoes to occur in this setting.
CONCLUSION: Malaria infections cluster around passively detected cases. The
majority of infections are asymptomatic and of densities below the limit of
detection of current RDTs. RACD using standard RDTs are unlikely to detect enough
malaria infections to dramatically reduce transmission. In low transmission
settings such as Namibia more sensitive field diagnostics or forms of focal
presumptive treatment should be tested as strategies to reduce malaria
transmission.

INTRODUCTION: The governments of Haiti and the Dominican Republic have a
binational agreement to work towards malaria elimination for the island of
Hispaniola by the year 2020. Understanding malaria-related knowledge and
behaviors can help inform elimination efforts. This study examined the
association between social-behavioral factors, like bedtime and bed net
ownership, with malaria seroconversion status among people in the Ouest and
Sud-Est departments of Haiti.
METHODS: In 2013, cross-sectional survey data (n=377) and blood samples were
collected from a convenience sample of individuals within community, clinic and
school settings. Logistic regression models were constructed to examine
associations between social-behavioral factors and malaria exposure, adjusting
for potential confounders.
RESULTS: Compared to people going to bed between 6 and 8 pm, those going to bed
between 8 and 10 pm were 2.67 (OR, 95% CI: 1.16-6.14) times as likely to have
been exposed to malaria. Participants who reported going to bed after 10 pm were 
5.96 times as likely to have had previous malaria exposure (OR, 95% CI:
2.26-15.7), compared to 6-8 pm. No significant associations were found between
malaria exposure and either insecticide use nor bed net ownership.
DISCUSSION: These findings are consistent with suspected feeding behaviors of
Anopheles albimanus, which prefers feeding at night and outdoors. Study findings 
may improve overall understanding of malaria transmission in Haiti and
potentially guide future studies conducted in this region.

BACKGROUND: Malaria in pregnancy poses a great risk to both mother and fetus. In 
Ghana, malaria accounts for 3.4% of deaths and 16.8% of all hospital admissions
in pregnant women. In 2014, Ghana updated her policy on intermittent preventive
treatment of malaria in pregnancy with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP) to
reflect the updated policy of the WHO. This study determined the level of uptake 
of sulfadoxine pyrimethamine (SP) to serve as baseline for monitoring progress
and also reviewed stock levels of SP, a key factor in the programme
implementation.
METHODS: A cross-sectional hospital-based study was carried out among nursing
mothers who had delivered within 12 weeks and were seeking postnatal care at Osu 
Government Maternity Home in Accra. Antenatal record books of the mothers were
reviewed and data collected on number of visits and receipt of IPTp-SP. Mothers
were interviewed and data collected on their background characteristics and
obstetric history. Data on SP stock levels for the past 6 months were also
reviewed. Logistic regression analysis was carried out to determine antenatal
indicators on uptake of IPTp-SP using Stata version 12.
RESULTS: The proportion of uptake of three-five doses of SP were: IPT3 (87.5%),
IPT4 (55.7%) and IPT5 (14.5%). The proportion of women who received the first
dose of SP at 16 weeks of gestation was 21.3%. Women who made ≥4 visits were more
likely to receive ≥3 doses of SP than those who made <4 visits (AOR = 4.57, 95%
CI 1.15-18.16, p < 0.05). Women receiving the first dose of SP in the third
trimester were less likely to receive ≥3 doses of SP than those who received the 
drug in the second trimester (AOR = 0.04, 95% CI 0.01-0.16, p < 0.05). Stock
levels of SP were adequate to meet the demands by the pregnant women at the
Maternity Home for the period under review.
CONCLUSIONS: The uptake of ≥3 doses of SP was high in the study area. Frequent
visits to the antenatal clinic and early uptake of the first dose of SP by
pregnant women are necessary to achieve the new target of five or more doses of
SP.

INTRODUCTION: In developing countries, HIV-infected children are at higher risk
of morbidity and mortality from opportunistic infections than HIV-uninfected
children. To address this problem, the Healthy Living Initiative (HLI) in
Mombasa, Kenya distributed basic care packages (BCPs) containing improved water
storage vessels, water treatment solution, soap, and insecticide-treated bed nets
to prevent diarrhea and malaria in children, and had community health workers
(CHWs) make bimonthly home visits to encourage adherence to HLI interventions and
antiretroviral (ARV) medicine use.
METHODS: To evaluate HLI, we enrolled 500 HIV-infected children from Bomu
Hospital. In the implementation phase, from February to August 2011, we conducted
surveys of caregivers, then provided free BCPs. In the evaluation phase, from
September 2011 to August 2012, CHWs recorded observations of BCP use during home 
visits. We abstracted hospital data to compare diarrhea and malaria episodes, and
pharmacy data on ARVs dispensed, between the 12-month preimplementation baseline 
phase (February 2010-January 2011) and the evaluation phase.
RESULTS: The retention rate of children in HLI was 78.4%. In a multivariable
logistic regression model adjusting for demographic characteristics, number of
CHW home visits, distance to clinic, orphan status, and number of ARVs dispensed,
children in HLI had 71% lower risk of diarrhea (relative risk 0.29, P < 0.001)
and 87% lower risk of malaria (relative risk 0.13, P = 0.001) during the
evaluation phase than the baseline phase; there was no independent association
between ARV use and illness.
CONCLUSIONS: HIV-infected children in HLI were less likely to experience diarrhea
and malaria during the evaluation phase than the baseline phase.

BACKGROUND: Understanding the dynamics of malaria transmission in diverse endemic
settings is key for designing and implementing locally adapted and sustainable
control and elimination strategies. A parasitological and epidemiological survey 
was conducted in September-October 2012, as a baseline underlying a 3-year
population-based longitudinal cohort study. The aim was to characterize malaria
transmission patterns in two contrasting ecological rural sites in the Peruvian
Amazon, Lupuna (LUP), a riverine environment, and Cahuide (CAH), associated with 
road-linked deforestation.
METHODS: After a full population census, 1941 individuals 3 years and older (829 
in LUP, 1112 in CAH) were interviewed, clinically examined and had a blood sample
taken for the detection of malaria parasites by microscopy and PCR.
Species-specific parasite prevalence was estimated overall and by site.
Multivariate logistic regression models assessed risk factors for parasite
infection by PCR, while SaTScan detected spatial clusters of PCR-positive
individuals within each site. In addition, data from routine malaria surveillance
in the period 2009-2012 were obtained.
RESULTS: Parasite prevalence by PCR was higher in CAH than in LUP for Plasmodium 
vivax (6.2% vs. 3.9%) and for Plasmodium falciparum (2.6% vs. 1.2%). Among
PCR-confirmed infections, asymptomatic (Asy) parasite carriers were always more
common than symptomatic (Sy) infections for P. vivax (Asy/Sy ratio: 2/1 in LUP
and 3.7/1 in CAH) and for P. falciparum (Asy/Sy ratio: 1.3/1 in LUP and 4/1 in
CAH). Sub-patent (Spat) infections also predominated over patent (Pat) infections
for both species: P. vivax (Spat/Pat ratio: 2.8/1 in LUP and 3.7/1 in CAH) and P.
falciparum malaria (Spat/Pat ratio: 1.9/1 in LUP and 26/0 in CAH). For CAH, age, 
gender and living in a household without electricity were significantly
associated with P. vivax infection, while only age and living in a household with
electricity was associated with P. falciparum infection. For LUP, only household 
overcrowding was associated with P. falciparum infection. The spatial analysis
only identified well-defined clusters of P. vivax and P. falciparum infected
individuals in CAH. Reported malaria incidence indicated that malaria
transmission has long occurred in LUP with primarily seasonal patterns, and
confirmed a malaria outbreak in CAH since May 2012.
CONCLUSIONS: This parasitological and epidemiological baseline assessment
demonstrates that malaria transmission and parasite prevalence is heterogeneous
in the Peruvian Amazon, and influenced by local socio-demographics and ecological
contexts. Riverine and road construction/deforestation contexts must be taken
into account in order to carry out effective anti-malaria control and elimination
efforts.

BACKGROUND: Measurements of anti-malarial antibodies are increasingly used as a
proxy of transmission intensity. Most serological surveys are based on the use of
cross-sectional data that, when age-stratified, approximates historical patterns 
of transmission within a population. Comparatively few studies leverage
longitudinal data to explicitly relate individual infection events with
subsequent antibody responses.
METHODS: The occurrence of seroconversion and seroreversion events for two
Plasmodium falciparum asexual stage antigens (MSP-1 and AMA-1) was examined using
three annual measurements of 691 individuals from a cohort of individuals in a
malaria-endemic area of rural east-central Tanzania. Mixed-effect logistic
regression models were employed to determine factors associated with changes in
serostatus over time.
RESULTS: While the expected population-level relationship between seroprevalence 
and disease incidence was observed, on an individual level the relationship
between individual infections and the antibody response was complex. MSP-1
antibody responses were more dynamic in response to the occurrence and resolution
of infection events than AMA-1, while the latter was more correlated with
consecutive infections. The MSP-1 antibody response to an observed infection
seemed to decay faster over time than the corresponding AMA-1 response.
Surprisingly, there was no evidence of an age effect on the occurrence of a
conversion or reversion event.
CONCLUSIONS: While the population-level results concur with previously published 
sero-epidemiological surveys, the individual-level results highlight the more
complex relationship between detected infections and antibody dynamics than can
be analysed using cross-sectional data. The longitudinal analysis of serological 
data may provide a powerful tool for teasing apart the complex relationship
between infection events and the corresponding immune response, thereby improving
the ability to rapidly assess the success or failure of malaria control
programmes.

BACKGROUND: The emergence of human malaria due to the monkey parasite Plasmodium 
knowlesi threatens elimination efforts in southeast Asia. Changes in land use are
thought to be driving the rise in reported P knowlesi cases, but the role of
individual-level factors is unclear. To address this knowledge gap we assessed
human and environmental factors associated with zoonotic knowlesi malaria risk.
METHODS: We did this population-based case-control study over a 2 year period in 
the state of Sabah in Malaysia. We enrolled cases with microscopy-positive,
PCR-confirmed malaria who presented to two primary referral hospitals serving the
adjacent districts of Kudat and Kota Marudu. We randomly selected three
malaria-negative community controls per case, who were matched by village within 
2 weeks of case detection. We obtained questionnaire data on demographics,
behaviour, and residential malaria risk factors, and we also assessed
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) enzyme activity. We used conditional
logistic regression models to evaluate exposure risk between P knowlesi cases and
controls, and between P knowlesi and human-only Plasmodium spp malaria cases.
FINDINGS: From Dec 5, 2012, to Jan 30, 2015, we screened 414 patients and
subsequently enrolled 229 cases with P knowlesi malaria mono-infection and 91
cases with other Plasmodium spp infection. We enrolled 953 matched controls,
including 683 matched to P knowlesi cases and 270 matched to non-P knowlesi
cases. Age 15 years or older (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 4·16, 95% CI 2·09-8·29,
p<0·0001), male gender (4·20, 2·54-6·97, p<0·0001), plantation work (3·50, CI,
1·34-9·15, p=0·011), sleeping outside (3·61, 1·48-8·85, p=0·0049), travel (2·48, 
1·45-4·23, p=0·0010), being aware of the presence of monkeys in the past 4 weeks 
(3·35, 1·91-5·88, p<0·0001), and having open eaves or gaps in walls (2·18,
1·33-3·59, p=0·0021) were independently associated with increased risk of
symptomatic P knowlesi infection. Farming occupation (aOR 1·89, 95% CI 1·07-3·35,
p=0·028), clearing vegetation (1·89, 1·11-3·22, p=0·020), and having long grass
around the house (2·08, 1·25-3·46, p=0·0048) increased risk for P knowlesi
infection but not other Plasmodium spp infection. G6PD deficiency seemed to be
protective against P knowlesi (aOR 0·20, 95% CI 0·04-0·96, p=0·045), as did
residual insecticide spraying of household walls (0·52, 0·31-0·87, p=0·014), with
the presence of young sparse forest (0·35, 0·20-0·63, p=00040) and rice paddy
around the house (0·16, 0·03-0·78, 0·023) also associated with decreased risk.
INTERPRETATION: Adult men working in agricultural areas were at highest risk of
knowlesi malaria, although peri-domestic transmission also occurrs. Human
behavioural factors associated with P knowlesi transmission could be targeted in 
future public health interventions.

BACKGROUND: The pathophysiology of the placental malaria is not fully understood.
If there is a fetal sex-specific susceptibility to malaria infection, this might 
add to the previous knowledge on the immunology, endocrinology and
pathophysiology of placental malaria infections.
AIMS: This study was conducted to assess whether the sex of the fetus was
associated with placental malaria infections.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed including a secondary
analysis of a cohort of women who were investigated for prevalence and risk
factors (including fetal sex) for placental malaria in eastern Sudan. Placental
histology was used to diagnose placental malaria infections.
RESULTS: Among 339 women enrolled, the mean (SD) age was 25.8 (6.7) years and
parity was 2.7 (2.2). Among the new born babies, 157 (46.3%) were male and 182
(53.7%) were female. Five (1.5%), 9 (2.7%) and 103 (30.4%) of the 339 placentas
had active, active-chronic, past-chronic malaria infection on histopathology
examination respectively, while 222 (65.5%) of them showed no malaria infection. 
Logistic regression analyses showed no associations between maternal age or
parity and placental malaria infections. Women who have blood group O (OR = 1.95,
95% CI = 1.19-3.10; P = 0.007) and women who had female new born were at higher
risk for placental malaria infections (OR = 2.55, 95% CI = 1.57-4.13; P< 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Fetal gender may be a novel risk factor for placental malaria. In
this work the female placentas were at higher risk for malaria infections than
the male placentas.

In sub-Saharan Africa, infectious diseases and malnutrition constitute the main
health problems in children, while adolescents and adults are increasingly facing
cardio-metabolic conditions. Among adolescents as the largest population group in
this region, we investigated the co-occurrence of infectious diseases,
malnutrition and cardio-metabolic risk factors (CRFs), and evaluated demographic,
socio-economic and medical risk factors for these entities. In a cross-sectional 
study among 188 adolescents in rural Ghana, malarial infection, common infectious
diseases and Body Mass Index were assessed. We measured ferritin, C-reactive
protein, retinol, fasting glucose and blood pressure. Socio-demographic data were
documented. We analyzed the proportions (95% confidence interval, CI) and the
co-occurrence of infectious diseases (malaria, other common diseases),
malnutrition (underweight, stunting, iron deficiency, vitamin A deficiency
[VAD]), and CRFs (overweight, obesity, impaired fasting glucose, hypertension).
In logistic regression, odds ratios (OR) and 95% CIs were calculated for the
associations with socio-demographic factors. In this Ghanaian population (age
range, 14.4-15.5 years; males, 50%), the proportions were for infectious diseases
45% (95% CI: 38-52%), for malnutrition 50% (43-57%) and for CRFs 16% (11-21%).
Infectious diseases and malnutrition frequently co-existed (28%; 21-34%).
Specifically, VAD increased the odds of non-malarial infectious diseases 3-fold
(95% CI: 1.03, 10.19). Overlap of CRFs with infectious diseases (6%; 2-9%) or
with malnutrition (7%; 3-11%) was also present. Male gender and low
socio-economic status increased the odds of infectious diseases and malnutrition,
respectively. Malarial infection, chronic malnutrition and VAD remain the
predominant health problems among these Ghanaian adolescents. Investigating the
relationships with evolving CRFs is warranted.

BACKGROUND: Malaria is one of the most important causes of morbidity and
mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. The disease is prevalent in over 75% of the
country's area making it the leading public health problems in the country.
Information on the prevalence of malaria and its associated factors is vital to
focus and improve malaria interventions.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out from October to November 2012 in
East Shewa zone of Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia. Adults aged 16 or more years 
with suspected malaria attending five health centers were eligible for the study.
Logistic regression models were used to examine the effect of each independent
variable on risk of subsequent diagnosis of malaria.
RESULTS: Of 810 suspected adult malaria patients who participated in the study,
204 (25%) had microscopically confirmed malaria parasites. The dominant
Plasmodium species were P. vivax (54%) and P. falciparum (45%), with mixed
infection of both species in one patient. A positive microscopic result was
significantly associated with being in the age group of 16 to 24 years [Adjusted 
Odds Ratio aOR 6.7; 95% CI: 2.3 to 19.5], 25 to 34 years [aOR 4.2; 95% CI: 1.4 to
12.4], and 35 to 44 years [aOR 3.7; 95% CI: 1.2-11.4] compared to 45 years or
older; being treated at Meki health center [aOR 4.1; 95% CI: 2.4 to 7.1], being
in Shashemene health center [aOR = 2.3; 95% CI: 1.5 to 4.5], and living in a
rural area compared to an urban area [aOR 1.7; 95% CI: 1.1 to 2.6)].
CONCLUSION: Malaria is an important public health problem among adults in the
study area with a predominance of P. vivax and P. falciparum infection. Thus,
appropriate health interventions should be implemented to prevent and control the
disease.

INTRODUCTION: Prior studies have shown an association between the onset of
hepatonephritis and the use of arteminisin-based combination therapy (ACT) during
the treatment of uncomplicated malaria. The objective of this study was to
identify the risk factors of hepatonephritis occurrence because of the
uncertainty regarding the appearance and the aggravation of this syndrome.
METHODS: A case-non case study was carried out on 428 notifications of
pharmacovigilance extracted from the database of the clinical pharmacology
department of the teaching hospital of Cocody from 2008 to 2012. Twenty-two cases
of hepatonephritis were identified. Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic
regression were performed to identify the risk factors and an adjusted odds ratio
(AOR) was calculated for each factor. The cut-off for significant association was
set at 0.05.
RESULTS: The average age of cases was comparable with that of non-cases
(34.04±3.68 years versus 33.94±3.92 years) with a median duration of therapy of
5 days and 6 days respectively. Male (AOR: 6.71; P<0.0001), toxic antecedents,
traditherapy (AOR: 6.25; P<0.0001), consumption of CTA (AOR: 1.25; P<0.0001),
betalactam (AOR: 0.46; P<0.0001), fluoroquinolone and self-medication (AOR: 2.89;
P<0.0001) would be the majors risk factors associated with hepatonephritis onset.
The risk increased with the number of antimalarial drugs taken. The evolution
towards the offset was less frequent (AOR: 0.078; P<0.02).
CONCLUSION: The risk factors of hepatonephritis were the consumption of malarial 
drugs and connected molecules, self-medication and misuse. The outcome was
generally unfavourable. Both the general population and health professionals
should be trained on the good use of the antimalarial drugs.

BACKGROUND: Malaria remains a major public health issue in most southern African 
countries as the disease remains hyper endemic. Burkina Faso continues to face
challenges in the treatment of malaria, as the utilization of preventive measures
remains low on a national scale. While it has been acknowledged that
understanding women's health-seeking behaviours, perception of malaria and its
preventive measures will aid in the control of malaria, there is paucity of
information on Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices among women in the reproductive
age of 15-49 years in Burkina Faso. This study investigated women's knowledge of 
malaria, attitudes towards malaria, and practices of malaria control in order to 
create a synergy between community efforts and governmental/non-governmental
malaria control interventions in Burkina Faso.
METHODS: The analysis used data from the 2014 Burkina Faso Malaria Indicator
Survey (MIS). In total 8111 women aged between 15-49 years were included in the
present study. We assessed women's knowledge about 1) preventive measures, 2)
causes and 3) symptoms of malaria, as well as malaria prevention practices for
their children and during pregnancy. The socio-demographic characteristics were
considered for Age, Religion, Education, Wealth index, Number of household
members, Sex of household head, Household possession of radio, TV and Received
antenatal care. Data were analyzed using STATA, version 14. Associations between 
variables were tested using a Chi-square and logistic regression, with the level 
of statistical significance set at 95%.
RESULTS: A preponderant proportion of respondents were aged 15-29 years (mean age
was 28.63±9.41). About three-quarters of the respondents had no formal education.
An estimated two-third of the participants were of Islamic faith, while access to
media and behavioural communication were generally poor. The level of knowledge
was 53% for rural women and 68.2% for urban dwellers. In sum, there was 56.1%
level of accurate knowledge of malaria among women in Burkina Faso. In the
multivariable logistic regression, women in rural location had 40% reduction in
the odds of having accurate knowledge of malaria when compared to urban women
(aOR = 0.60; 95%CI: 0.52-0.68). The educational level was a key factor in the
knowledge of malaria. The odds of having accurate knowledge of malaria increased 
as the educational level increased, hence, women with secondary and higher
education had 29% and 93% increase in the odds of having accurate knowledge of
malaria when compared to the women without formal education. Results indicate
that antenatal care (ANC) services were major sources of information on malaria. 
Women who reportedly received ANC were 3.9 times more likely to have accurate
knowledge of malaria when compared to those who did not utilize skilled ANC
services (aOR = 3.90; 95%CI = 3.34-4.56).
CONCLUSION: The overall knowledge of malaria prevention practices among a large
proportion of women was found to be low, which implies that the knowledge about
the prevention of malaria should be improved upon by both urban and rural
dwellers. There is need for concerted behavioural communication intervention to
improve the knowledge of malaria especially for rural dwellers regarding malaria 
prevention measures, causes and symptoms. Consistent efforts at providing
relevant information by health organizations are needed to reduce and control
incidences of malaria in the general public.

BACKGROUND: Utilization of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) is regarded as 
key malaria prevention and control strategy. However, studies have reported a
large gap in terms of both ownership and utilization particularly in the
sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). With continual efforts to improve the use of LLIN and
to progress malaria elimination, examining the factors influencing the ownership 
and usage of LLIN is of high importance. Therefore, the current study was
conducted to examine the level of ownership and use of LLIN along with
identification of associated factors at household level.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Mirab Abaya District, Southern 
Ethiopia in June and July 2014. A total of 540 households, with an estimated 2690
members, were selected in four kebeles of the district known to have high
incidence of malaria. Trained data collectors interviewed household heads to
collect information on the knowledge, ownership and utilization of LLINs, which
was complemented by direct observation on the conditions and use of the nets
through house-to-house visit. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression
analyses were used to determine factors associated to LLIN use.
RESULTS: Of 540 households intended to be included in the survey, 507 responded
to the study (94.24% response rate), covering the homes of 2759 people. More than
58% of the households had family size >5 (the regional average), and 60.2% of
them had at least one child below the age of 5 years. The ownership of at least
one LLIN among households surveyed was 89.9%, and using at least one LLIN during 
the night prior to the survey among net owners was 85.1% (n = 456). Only 36.7%
(186) mentioned at least as the mean of correct scores of all participants for 14
possible malaria symptoms and 32.7% (166) knew at least as the mean of correct
scores of all participants for possible preventive methods. Over 30% of nets
owned by the households were out of use. After controlling for confounding
factors, having two or more sleeping places (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.58,
95% CI 1.17, 5.73), knowledge that LLIN prevents malaria (aOR = 2.51, 95% CI
1.17, 5.37), the presence of hanging bed nets (aOR = 19.24, 95% CI 9.24, 40.07)
and walls of the house plastered or painted >12 months ago (aOR = 0.09, 95% CI
0.01, 0.71) were important predictors of LLIN utilization.
CONCLUSIONS: This study found a higher proportion of LLIN ownership and
utilization by households than had previously been found in similar studies in
Ethiopia, and in many studies in SSA. However, poor knowledge of the transmission
mechanisms and the symptoms of malaria, and vector control measures to prevent
malaria were evident. Moderate proportions of nets were found to be out of use or
in poor repair. Efforts should be in place to maintain the current rate of
utilization of LLIN in the district and improve on the identified gaps in order
to support the elimination of malaria.

BACKGROUND: Cross-border malaria transmission is an important problem for
national malaria control programmes. The epidemiology of cross-border malaria is 
further complicated in areas where Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax are
both endemic. By combining passive case detection data with entomological data, a
transmission scenario on the northwestern Thai-Myanmar border where P. falciparum
is likely driven by importation was described, whereas P. vivax is also locally
transmitted. This study highlights the differences in the level of control
required to eliminate P. falciparum and P. vivax from the same region.
METHODS: Malaria case data were collected from malaria clinics in Suan Oi
village, Tak Province, Thailand between 2011 and 2014. Infections were diagnosed 
by light microscopy. Demographic data, including migrant status, were correlated 
with concomitantly collected entomology data from 1330 mosquito trap nights using
logistic regression. Malaria infection in the captured mosquitoes was detected by
ELISA.
RESULTS: Recent migrants were almost four times more likely to be infected with
P. falciparum compared with Thai patients (OR 3.84, p < 0.001) and cases were
significantly associated with seasonal migration. However, P. falciparum
infection was not associated with the Anopheles mosquito capture rates,
suggesting predominantly imported infections. In contrast, recent migrants were
equally likely to present with P. vivax as mid-term migrants. Both migrant groups
were twice as likely to be infected with P. vivax in comparison to the resident
Thai population (OR 1.96, p < 0.001 and OR 1.94, p < 0.001, respectively).
Plasmodium vivax cases were strongly correlated with age and local capture rates 
of two major vector species Anopheles minimus and Anopheles maculatus (OR 1.23,
p = 0.020 and OR 1.33, p = 0.046, respectively), suggesting that a high level of 
local transmission might be causing these infections.
CONCLUSIONS: On the Thai-Myanmar border, P. falciparum infections occur mostly in
the recent migrant population with a seasonality reflecting that of agricultural 
activity, rather than that of the local mosquito population. This suggests that
P. falciparum was mostly imported. In contrast, P. vivax cases were significantly
associated with mosquito capture rates and less with migrant status, indicating
local transmission. This highlights the different timelines and requirements for 
P. falciparum and P. vivax elimination in the same region and underlines the
importance of multinational, cross-border malaria control.

BACKGROUND: Most evidence on the association between malaria in pregnancy and
adverse pregnancy outcomes focuses on falciparum malaria detected at birth. We
assessed the association between the number and timing of falciparum and vivax
malaria episodes during pregnancy on small-for-gestational-age (SGA) and preterm 
birth.
METHODS: We analysed observational data collected from antenatal clinics on the
Thailand-Myanmar border (1986-2015). We assessed the effects of the total number 
of malaria episodes in pregnancy on SGA and the effects of malaria in pregnancy
on SGA, very preterm birth, and late preterm birth, by the gestational age at
malaria detection and treatment using logistic regression models with
time-dependent malaria variables (monthly intervals). World Health Organisation
definitions of very preterm birth (≥28 and <32 weeks) and late preterm birth (≥32
and <37 weeks) and international SGA standards were used.
RESULTS: Of 50,060 pregnant women followed, 8221 (16%) had malaria during their
pregnancy. Of the 50,060 newborns, 10,005 (21%) were SGA, 540 (1%) were very
preterm, and 4331 (9%) were late preterm. The rates of falciparum and vivax
malaria were highest at 6 and 5 weeks' gestation, respectively. The odds of SGA
increased linearly by 1.13-fold (95% confidence interval: 1.09, 1.17) and
1.27-fold (1.21, 1.33) per episode of falciparum and vivax malaria, respectively.
Falciparum malaria at any gestation period after 12-16 weeks and vivax malaria
after 20-24 weeks were associated with SGA (falciparum odds ratio, OR range:
1.15-1.63 [p range: <0.001-0.094]; vivax OR range: 1.12-1.54 [p range:
<0.001-0.138]). Falciparum malaria at any gestation period after 24-28 weeks was 
associated with either very or late preterm birth (OR range: 1.44-2.53; p range: 
<0.001-0.001). Vivax malaria at 24-28 weeks was associated with very preterm
birth (OR: 1.79 [1.11, 2.90]), and vivax malaria at 28-32 weeks was associated
with late preterm birth (OR: 1.23 [1.01, 1.50]). Many of these associations held 
for asymptomatic malaria.
CONCLUSIONS: Protection against malaria should be started as early as possible in
pregnancy. Malaria control and elimination efforts in the general population can 
avert the adverse consequences associated with treated asymptomatic malaria in
pregnancy.

Background: Anemia in women of reproductive age (WRA) (age range: 15-49 y)
remains a public health problem globally, and reducing anemia in women by 50% by 
2025 is a goal of the World Health Assembly.Objective: We assessed the
associations between anemia and multiple proximal risk factors (e.g., iron and
vitamin A deficiencies, inflammation, malaria, and body mass index) and distal
risk factors (e.g., education status, household sanitation and hygiene, and urban
or rural residence) in nonpregnant WRA.Design: Cross-sectional, nationally
representative data from 10 surveys (n = 27,018) from the Biomarkers Reflecting
Inflammation and Nutritional Determinants of Anemia (BRINDA) project were
analyzed individually and pooled by the infection burden and risk in the country.
We examined the severity of anemia and measured the bivariate associations
between anemia and factors at the country level and by infection burden, which we
classified with the use of the national prevalences of malaria, HIV,
schistosomiasis, sanitation, and water-quality indicators. Pooled multivariate
logistic regression models were constructed for each infection-burden category to
identify independent determinants of anemia (hemoglobin concertation <120
g/L).Results: Anemia prevalence was ∼40% in countries with a high infection
burden and 12% and 7% in countries with moderate and low infection burdens,
respectively. Iron deficiency was consistently associated with anemia in
multivariate models, but the proportion of anemic women who were iron deficient
was considerably lower in the high-infection group (35%) than in the moderate-
and low-infection groups (65% and 71%, respectively). In the multivariate
analysis, inflammation, vitamin A insufficiency, socioeconomic status, and age
were also significantly associated with anemia, but malaria and vitamin B-12 and 
folate deficiencies were not.Conclusions: The contribution of iron deficiency to 
anemia varies according to a country's infection burden. Anemia-reduction
programs for WRA can be improved by considering the underlying infection burden
of the population and by assessing the overlap of micronutrient deficiencies and 
anemia.

Background: A lack of information on the etiology of anemia has hampered the
design and monitoring of anemia-control efforts.Objective: We aimed to evaluate
predictors of anemia in preschool children (PSC) (age range: 6-59 mo) by country 
and infection-burden category.Design: Cross-sectional data from 16 surveys (n =
29,293) from the Biomarkers Reflecting Inflammation and Nutritional Determinants 
of Anemia (BRINDA) project were analyzed separately and pooled by category of
infection burden. We assessed relations between anemia (hemoglobin concentration 
<110 g/L) and severe anemia (hemoglobin concentration <70 g/L) and
individual-level (age, anthropometric measures, micronutrient deficiencies,
malaria, and inflammation) and household-level predictors; we also examined the
proportion of anemia with concomitant iron deficiency (defined as an
inflammation-adjusted ferritin concentration <12 μg/L). Countries were grouped
into 4 categories on the basis of risk and burden of infectious disease, and a
pooled multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted for each
group.Results: Iron deficiency, malaria, breastfeeding, stunting, underweight,
inflammation, low socioeconomic status, and poor sanitation were each associated 
with anemia in >50% of surveys. Associations between breastfeeding and anemia
were attenuated by controlling for child age, which was negatively associated
with anemia. The most consistent predictors of severe anemia were malaria, poor
sanitation, and underweight. In multivariable pooled models, child age, iron
deficiency, and stunting independently predicted anemia and severe anemia.
Inflammation was generally associated with anemia in the high- and very
high-infection groups but not in the low- and medium-infection groups. In PSC
with anemia, 50%, 30%, 55%, and 58% of children had concomitant iron deficiency
in low-, medium-, high-, and very high-infection categories,
respectively.Conclusions: Although causal inference is limited by cross-sectional
survey data, results suggest anemia-control programs should address both iron
deficiency and infections. The relative importance of factors that are associated
with anemia varies by setting, and thus, country-specific data are needed to
guide programs.

BACKGROUND: Malaria is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in
malaria-endemic areas. Indoor residual spray is an effective intervention to
control malaria, but high community-level coverage is needed to maximize its
impact.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Using thirty-four two-stage cluster surveys (e.g.,
demographic and health surveys) and lot quality assurance sampling, indoor
residual spray was estimated at the community level (i.e. enumeration-area)
across sub-Saharan Africa since 2010. For communities receiving indoor residual
spray a logistic regression predicted whether community-level coverage exceeded
50% or not. Household-level coverage was equitable both in terms of wealth and
urban/rural, with poorer and rural houses more likely to be sprayed than richer
and urban houses. Coverage of indoor residual spray at the community level is
poor across the continent, with 54% of communities receiving the intervention not
reaching 50% coverage. Having >50% coverage at the community-level was not
associated with increasing the number of houses sprayed in the country.
CONCLUSIONS: Implementation and monitoring of indoor residual coverage at small
geographical scales need to improve greatly to receive maximum benefit of the
intervention.

Health, New Orleans, LA, USA.

BACKGROUND: Insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) are the primary tool for vector
control, and optimizing ITN use is a key concern of national programmes.
Available evidence indicates that bed net users often have preferences for shape,
colour, size, and other attributes, but it is unclear whether these preferences
are strong enough to have any significant effect on bed net use, and whether
countries and donors should invest in more expensive attributes in order to
maximize ITN use. The link between bed net attributes, preferences, and use was
investigated using a literature review and review of publicly available,
nationally representative household surveys from sub-Saharan Africa.
METHODS: A literature search was conducted to identify publications with data on 
preferences for net attributes and on associations between net attributes and
use. Publicly available DHS and MIS datasets were screened for variables on net
preferences and net attributes. Wald tests were run to obtain odds ratios and
confidence intervals for the use of nets of various attributes in univariate
analysis. A multilevel logistic regression was constructed to assess the odds of 
a net's use, controlling for background variables and adding random effects
variables at the household and cluster level.
RESULTS: Preferences for certain net attributes exist, but do not impede high
rates of net use in countries where data were available. Stated preferences for
shape and colour do not significantly influence net use to degrees that would
require action by programme planners. By and large, people are using the nets
they receive, and when they do not, it is for reasons unrelated to shape and size
(primarily perceived mosquito density, heat or an excess of nets). Households in 
higher wealth quintiles tend to own greater numbers of conical nets, indicating
that they have the ability to obtain or purchase these nets on their own, and
individuals resident in higher wealth quintile households also use conical nets
preferentially.
CONCLUSIONS: The increased manufacturing costs for conical nets are not
outweighed by the very small, often non-existent, increases in use rates in
sub-Saharan Africa. Programmes that wish to explore the relationship between net 
attributes, preferences and use rates should include these questions in
nationally representative household surveys to be able to capture trends across
geographic and socio-economic groups.

BACKGROUND: In 2012, Tororo District had the highest malaria burden in Uganda
with community Plasmodium prevalence of 48%. To control malaria in the district, 
the Ministry of Health introduced universal distribution of long lasting
insecticide-treated nets (LLINs) in 2013 and added indoor residual spraying (IRS)
in 2014. This study assessed malaria incidence, test positivity rates and
outpatient (OPD) attendance due to malaria before and after vector control
interventions.
METHODS: This study was based on analysis of Health Management Information System
(HMIS) secondary malaria surveillance data of 2,727,850 patient records in OPD
registers of 61 health facilities from 2012 to 2015. The analysis estimated
monthly malaria incidence for the entire population and also separately for <5-
and ≥5-year-olds before and after introduction of vector control interventions;
determined laboratory test positivity rates and annual percentage of malaria
cases in OPD. Chi square for trends was used to analyse annual change in malaria 
incidence and logistic regression for monthly reduction.
RESULTS: Following universal LLINs coverage, the annual mean monthly malaria
incidence fell from 95 cases in 2013 to 76 cases per 1000 in 2014 with no
significant monthly reduction (OR = 0.99, 95% CI 0.96-1.01, P = 0.37). Among
children <5 years, the malaria incidence reduced from 130 to 100 cases per 1000
(OR = 0.98, 95% CI 0.97-1.00, P = 0.08) when LLINs were used alone in 2014, but
declined to 45 per 1000 in 2015 when IRS was combined with LLINs (OR = 0.94, 95% 
CI 0.91-0.996, P < 0.0001). Among individuals aged ≥5 years, mean monthly malaria
incidence reduced from 59 to 52 cases per 1000 (OR = 0.99, 95% CI 0.97-1.02,
P = 0.8) when LLINs were used alone in 2014, but reduced significantly to 25 per 
1000 in 2015 (OR = 0.91, 95% CI 0.88-0.94, P < 0.0001). Malaria test positivity
rate reduced from 57% in 2013 to 30% (Chi = 15, P < 0.0001) in 2015. Slide
positivity rate reduced from 45% in 2013 to 21% in 2015 (P = 0.004) while RDT
positivity declined from 69 to 40%.
CONCLUSIONS: A rapid reduction in malaria incidence was observed in Tororo
District following the introduction of IRS in addition to LLINs. There was no
significant reduction in malaria incidence following universal distribution of
LLINs to communities before introduction of IRS.

Ecuador in the northwestern edge of South America is struggling by vector-borne
diseases with an endemic-epidemic behavior leading to an enormous public health
problem. Malaria, which has a cyclicality in its dynamics, is closely related to 
climatic, ecological and socio-economic phenomena. The main objective of this
research has been to compare three different prediction species models, the
so-called Maxent, logistic regression and multi criteria evaluation with fuzzy
logic, in order to determine the model which best describes the ecological niche 
of the Anopheles spp species, which transmits malaria within Ecuador. After
performing a detailed data collection and data processing, we applied the
mentioned models and validated them with a statistical analysis in order to
discover that the Maxent model has been the model that best defines the
distribution of Anopheles spp within the territory. The determined sites, which
are of high strategic value and important for the increasing national
development, will now be able to initiate preventive countermeasures based on
this study.

BACKGROUND: The current stage of malaria elimination in China requires
experienced local health workers with sufficient knowledge of malaria who help to
keep the public health system vigilant about a possible resurgence. However, the 
influencing factors of local health workers' knowledge level are not fully
comprehended. This study aims to explore the factors with heavy impact on local
health worker's knowledge of malaria and propose corresponding suggestions.
METHODS: Underpinned by stratified sampling method, a cross-sectional survey was 
carried out between November 2014 and April 2016. Chi square test was performed
to identify the factors with potential influence on health workers' knowledge
level of malaria. Bivariate logistic regression was employed to explore the
relationship between the predictors and local health workers' knowledge level of 
malaria. Layered Chi square test was used to calculate the homogeneity of the
interaction between training approaches and the percentage of participants with
high-level knowledge.
RESULTS: The endemic type of county and type of organization played the most
significant role in influencing local health workers' knowledge level regarding
malaria in the sample population. The participants from Type 1 and Type 2
counties were 4.3 times (4.336 and 4.328, respectively) more likely to have
high-level knowledge of malaria than those who work in Type 3 counties. The
probability of having high-level knowledge amongst the participants from
county-level facilities (county hospitals and CDCs) were more than 2.2 times
higher than those who work in villages. Other socio-demographic factors, such as 
education and work experience, also affected one's knowledge regarding malaria.
Amongst the six most-used training approaches, electronic material (OR = 2.356,
95% CI 1.112-4.989), thematic series (OR = 1.784, 95% CI 0.907-3.508) and
supervision (OR = 2.788, 95% CI 1.018-7.632) were proven with significant
positive impact on local health workers' knowledge of malaria.
CONCLUSION: Village doctors and who served in Type 3 counties were identified as 
the ones in urgent need of effective training. Three types of training
approaches, including electronic material, thematic series and supervision, were 
proven to be effective in improving local health workers' knowledge.
Nevertheless, the coverage of these training approaches was still limited. This
study suggests expanding the coverage of training, especially the three
particular types of training, to local health workers, particularly to the target
populations (village doctors and who served in Type 3 counties). Online training,
small group discussion and targeted skill development may be the directions for
the future development of training programmes.

Background: Noncommunicable diseases and obesity are increasing in prevalence
globally, also in populations at risk of malaria. We sought to investigate if
comorbidity, in terms of chronic diseases and obesity, is associated with severe 
Plasmodium falciparum malaria.
Methods: We performed a retrospective observational study in adults (≥18 years of
age) diagnosed with malaria in Sweden between January 1995 and May 2015. We
identified cases through the surveillance database at the Public Health Agency of
Sweden and reviewed clinical data from 18 hospitals. Multivariable logistic
regression was used to assess associations between comorbidities and severe
malaria.
Results: Among 937 adults (median age, 37 years; 66.5% were male), patients with 
severe malaria had higher prevalence of chronic diseases (28/92 [30.4%]) compared
with nonsevere cases (151/845 [17.9%]) (P = .004). Charlson comorbidity score ≥1 
was associated with severe malaria (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.63 [95%
confidence interval {CI}, 1.45-4.77), as was diabetes among individual diagnoses 
(aOR, 2.98 [95% CI, 1.25-7.09]). Median body mass index was higher among severe
(29.3 kg/m2) than nonsevere cases (24.7 kg/m2) (P < .001). Obesity was strongly
associated with severe malaria, both independently (aOR, 5.58 [95% CI,
2.03-15.36]) and in combination with an additional metabolic risk factor
(hypertension, dyslipidemia, or diabetes) (aOR, 6.54 [95% CI, 1.87-22.88]). The
associations were observed among nonimmune travelers as well as immigrants from
endemic areas.
Conclusions: Comorbidities, specifically obesity and diabetes, are previously
unidentified risk factors for severe malaria in adults diagnosed with P.
falciparum. Noncommunicable diseases should be considered in the acute management
and prevention of malaria.

Pneumonia and diarrhea are leading causes of child deaths in Malawi. Guidelines
to manage childhood illnesses in resource-poor settings exist, but studies have
reported low health-care worker (HCW) adherence to guidelines. We conducted a
health facility survey from January to March 2015 to assess HCW management of
pneumonia and diarrhea in children < 5 years of age in southern Malawi, and to
determine factors associated with case management quality. Descriptive statistics
and multivariable logistic regression models examined patient, HCW, and health
facility factors associated with recommended pneumonia and diarrhea management,
using Malawi's national guidelines as the gold standard. Of 694 surveyed children
2-59 months of age at 95 health facilities, 132 (19.0%) met survey criteria for
pneumonia; HCWs gave recommended antibiotic treatment to 90 (68.2%). Of 723
children < 5 years of age, 222 (30.7%) had uncomplicated diarrhea; HCWs provided 
recommended treatment to 94 (42.3%). In multivariable analyses, caregivers'
spontaneous report of children's symptoms was associated with recommended
treatment of both pneumonia (odds ratio [OR]: 2.8, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 
1.2-6.8, P = 0.023) and diarrhea (OR: 24.2, 95% CI: 6.0-97.0, P < 0001). Malaria 
diagnosis was negatively associated with recommended treatment (OR for pneumonia:
0.5, 95% CI: 0.2-1.0, P = 0.046; OR for diarrhea: 0.3, 95% CI: 0.1-0.6, P =
0.003). To improve quality of care, children should be assessed systematically,
even when malaria is suspected. Renewed efforts to invigorate such a systematic
approach, including HCW training, regular follow-up supervision, and monitoring
HCW performance, are needed in Malawi.

BACKGROUND: Pregnant women are a high-risk group for Plasmodium falciparum
infections, which may result in maternal anaemia and low birth weight newborns,
among other adverse birth outcomes. Intermittent preventive treatment with
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine during pregnancy (IPTp-SP) is widely implemented to
prevent these negative effects of malaria. However, resistance against SP by P.
falciparum may decrease efficacy of IPTp-SP. Combinations of point mutations in
the dhps (codons A437, K540) and dhfr genes (codons N51, C59, S108) of P.
falciparum are associated with SP resistance. In this study the prevalence of SP 
resistance mutations was determined among P. falciparum found in pregnant women
and the general population (GP) from Nanoro, Burkina Faso and the association of 
IPTp-SP dosing and other variables with mutations was studied.
METHODS: Blood spots on filter papers were collected from pregnant women at their
first antenatal care visit (ANC booking) and at delivery, from an ongoing trial
and from the GP in a cross-sectional survey. The dhps and dhfr genes were
amplified by nested PCR and products were sequenced to identify mutations
conferring resistance (ANC booking, n = 400; delivery, n = 223; GP, n = 400).
Prevalence was estimated with generalized estimating equations and for
multivariate analyses mixed effects logistic regression was used.
RESULTS: The prevalence of the triple dhfr mutation was high, and significantly
higher in the GP and at delivery than at ANC booking, but it did not affect birth
weight. Furthermore, quintuple mutations (triple dhfr and double dhps mutations) 
were found for the first time in Burkina Faso. IPTp-SP did not significantly
affect the occurrence of any of the mutations, but high transmission season was
associated with increased mutation prevalence in delivery samples. It is unclear 
why the prevalence of mutations was higher in the GP than in pregnant women at
ANC booking.
CONCLUSION: The high number of mutants and the presence of quintuple mutants in
Burkina Faso confirm concerns about the efficacy of IPTp-SP in the near future.
Other drug combinations to tackle malaria in pregnancy should, therefore, be
explored. An increase in mutation prevalence due to IPTp-SP dosing could not be
confirmed.

BACKGROUND: Intravascular hemolysis is an intrinsic feature of severe malaria
pathophysiology but the pathogenic role of cell-free hemoglobin-mediated
oxidative stress in severe malaria associated acute kidney injury (AKI) is
unknown.
METHODS: As part of a prospective observational study, enrolment plasma cell-free
hemoglobin (CFH), lipid peroxidation markers (F2-isoprostanes (F2-IsoPs) and
isofurans (IsoFs)), red cell deformability, and serum creatinine were quantified 
in Bangladeshi patients with severe falciparum malaria (n = 107), uncomplicated
malaria (n = 80) and sepsis (n = 28). The relationships between these indices and
kidney function and clinical outcomes were examined.
RESULTS: AKI was diagnosed at enrolment in 58% (62/107) of consecutive patients
with severe malaria, defined by an increase in creatinine ≥1.5 times expected
baseline. Severe malaria patients with AKI had significantly higher plasma
cell-free hemoglobin (geometric mean CFH: 8.8 μM; 95% CI, 6.2-12.3 μM),
F2-isoprostane (56.7 pg/ml; 95% CI, 45.3-71.0 pg/ml) and isofuran (109.2 pg/ml;
95% CI, 85.1-140.1 pg/ml) concentrations on enrolment compared to those without
AKI (CFH: 5.1 μM; 95% CI, 4.0-6.6 μM; P = 0.018; F2-IsoPs: 27.8 pg/ml; 95% CI,
23.7-32.7 pg/ml; P < 0.001; IsoFs: 41.7 pg/ml; 95% CI, 30.2-57.6 pg/ml;
P < 0.001). Cell-free hemoglobin correlated with markers of hemolysis, parasite
burden (P. falciparum histidine rich protein 2 (PfHRP2)), and F2-IsoPs. Plasma
F2-IsoPs and IsoFs inversely correlated with pH, positively correlated with
creatinine, PfHRP2 and fractional excretion of sodium, and were higher in
patients later requiring hemodialysis. Plasma F2-IsoP concentrations also
inversely correlated with red cell deformability and were higher in fatal cases. 
Mixed effects modeling including an interaction term for CFH and time showed that
F2-IsoPs, IsoFs, PfHRP2, CFH, and red cell rigidity were independently associated
with increasing creatinine over 72 h. Multivariable logistic regression showed
that admission F2-IsoPs, IsoFs and red cell deformability were associated with
the need for subsequent hemodialysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Cell-free hemoglobin and lipid peroxidation are associated with
acute kidney injury and disease severity in falciparum malaria, suggesting a
pathophysiological role in renal tubular injury. Evaluation of adjunctive
therapies targeting cell-free hemoglobin-mediated oxidative stress is warranted.

BACKGROUND: Over the past decade, the magnitude and intensity of disasters have
been vividly rising globally due to the forces of nature or man. This study aimed
at assessing the perceived knowledge, experiences and training needs of health
professionals regarding disasters, their prevention and management in Jimma Zone,
Southwest Ethiopia.
METHODS: An institution based cross-sectional survey was conducted on 377 health 
professionals taken from 9 randomly selected districts out of 18. All health
professionals working at health offices, hospitals and health centers were
included. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire which was
developed by the investigators after reviewing the relevant literature in the
field. Data were coded and entered into SPSS 20 software for cleaning and
analysis. Descriptive and logistic regression analyses were done.
RESULTS: The majority (85.1%) of the participants were able to define the concept
of disaster from various perspectives; 9.7% did not know about it at all and 5.2%
could describe the concept partially or misconceived it. The majority (84.3%)
agreed that disaster has direct public health consequences on humans. The main
public health consequence of disaster the participants mentioned was
environmental pollution (65.8%). Malaria, measles and diarrhoeal diseases
accounted for 35.5%, 33.1% and 10.5% of the epidemics, respectively. Only 20.6%
of the respondents were trained on disaster related topics in the last two years.
The majority felt that they had poor knowledge on early warning indicators of
drought (48.0%) and flood (48.0%). Simialry, 50.8%, 47.7%, 51.1% and 42.6% of the
participants had poor knowledge on preparedness to drought, preparedness to
flood, response to drought, response to flood. On composite scale, they generally
perceived to have adequate (29.4%), moderate (32.4%) and poor (38.2%) knowledge
about early warning information bout, preparedness for and response to common
disasters. A vast majority (92.8%) reported that they need training on disaster
preparedness, management and response.
CONCLUSION: A considerable number of professionals had limited understanding
about the concept of disaster and response to certain specific disasters. They
also had limited opportunities for training, despite their felt needs. Therefore,
training should be provided focusing on the specific gaps identified.

BACKGROUND: Africa is the most affected continent with 200,000 new born affected 
by sickle cell anemia annually with of 5% of under five deaths. Nigeria has the
largest sickle cell gene pool in the world with about 2% of all babies born to
Nigerian parents. This study therefore sets out to assess the prevention
practices influencing the frequency of occurrence of vaso-occlusive crisis among 
patients in Ogun State.
METHODS: This study is a descriptive cross-sectional study conducted in Abeokuta 
South Local Government Area Ogun State. A consecutive non randomized sampling of 
all the sickle cell patients that attend the selected facilities was recruited
into the study. Data were collected with the use of questionnaires which were
interviewer administered. A total of 415 patients were recruited into the study. 
Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS for Windows version 20.0.
RESULT: Two- third [64.8%] of study participants have crisis twice or more in a
month. The frequency of crisis was statistically significantly associated with
the age of the child [p = 0.006], use of anti-malaria prophylaxis [p = 0.006],
analgesics [p = 0.0001], taking of plenty fluid [p = 0.001] and soothing herbs
[p = 0.0001]. Lifestyle factors such as giving balance diet [p = 0.217],
restriction from strenuous activities [p = 0.08], and attending Clinic
appointments regularly [p = 0.126] were not statistically associated with
reduction in the frequency of crisis. Logistic regression analysis shows that
predictors of frequent crisis were individuals who were using prophylaxis
antimalarial drugs [OR = 0.12, CI = 0.05-0.33] and analgesics [OR = 0.15,
C.I = 0.06-0.34].
CONCLUSION: The study reveals that majority of the participants have high
frequency of crisis in a month. Drug prophylaxis rather than lifestyle factors
may be more important in the prevention of vaso-occlusive crisis among sickle
cell patients.

Background: Optimal use of mass/targeted screen-and-treat or mass or focal drug
administration as malaria elimination strategies remains unclear. We therefore
studied spatial distribution of Plasmodium falciparum infections to compare
simulated effects of these strategies on reducing the parasite reservoir in a
pre-elimination setting.
Methods: P. falciparum rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and molecular (polymerase
chain reaction [PCR]) and serological (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay)
analyses were performed on finger-prick blood samples from a population-based
survey in 3 adjacent communities.
Results: Among 5278 persons screened, 13 (0.2%) were positive by RDT and 123
(2.3%) by PCR. PCR-positive individuals were scattered over the study area, but
logistic regression analysis suggested a propensity of these infections to
cluster around RDT-positive individuals. The odds ratios for being PCR positive
was 7.4 (95% confidence interval, 2.8-19.9) for those living in the household of 
an RDT-positive individual and 1.64 (1.0-2.8; P = .06) for those living within
<300 m, compared with >1000 m. Treating everyone within households of
RDT-positive individuals (1% population) would target 13% of those who are PCR
positive. Treating all living within a radius of <300 or <1000 m (14% or 58%
population) would target 30% or 66% of infections, respectively. Among 4431
serologically screened individuals, 26% were seropositive. Treating everyone
within seropositive households (63% population) would target 77% of PCR-positive 
individuals.
Conclusions: Presumptive malaria treatment seemed justified within RDT-positive
households and potentially worth considering within, for example, a radius of
<300 m. Serology was not discriminative enough in identifying ongoing infections 
for improving focal interventions in this setting but may rather be useful to
detect larger transmission foci.

BACKGROUND: Resistance of malaria vectors to pyrethroid insecticides has been
attributed to selection pressure from long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs),
indoor residual spraying (IRS), and the use of chemicals in agriculture. The use 
of different classes of insecticides in combination or by rotation has been
recommended for resistance management. The aim of this study was to understand
the role of IRS with a carbamate insecticide in management of pyrethroid
resistance.
METHODS: Anopheles mosquitoes were collected from multiple sites in nine
districts of Uganda (up to five sites per district). Three districts had been
sprayed with bendiocarb. Phenotypic resistance was determined using standard
susceptibility tests. Molecular assays were used to determine the frequency of
resistance mutations. The kdr L1014S homozygote frequency in Anopheles gambiae
s.s. was used as the outcome measure to test the effects of various factors using
a logistic regression model. Bendiocarb coverage, annual rainfall, altitude,
mosquito collection method, LLIN use, LLINs distributed in the previous 5 years, 
household use of agricultural pesticides, and malaria prevalence in children
2-9 years old were entered as explanatory variables.
RESULTS: Tests with pyrethroid insecticides showed resistance and suspected
resistance levels in all districts except Apac (a sprayed district). Bendiocarb
resistance was not detected in sprayed sites, but was confirmed in one unsprayed 
site (Soroti). Anopheles gambiae s.s. collected from areas sprayed with
bendiocarb had significantly less kdr homozygosity than those collected from
unsprayed areas. Mosquitoes collected indoors as adults had significantly higher 
frequency of kdr homozygotes than mosquitoes collected as larvae, possibly
indicating selective sampling of resistant adults, presumably due to exposure to 
insecticides inside houses that would disproportionately affect susceptible
mosquitoes. The effect of LLIN use on kdr homozygosity was significantly modified
by annual rainfall. In areas receiving high rainfall, LLIN use was associated
with increased kdr homozygosity and this association weakened as rainfall
decreased, indicating more frequency of exposure to pyrethroids in relatively wet
areas with high vector density.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that using a carbamate insecticide for IRS in
areas with high levels of pyrethroid resistance may reduce kdr frequencies in An.
gambiae s.s.

BACKGROUND: Improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in
pediatric severe malarial anemia (SMA) pathogenesis is a crucial step in the
design of novel therapeutics. Identification of host genetic susceptibility
factors in immune regulatory genes offers an important tool for deciphering
malaria pathogenesis. The IL-23/IL-17 immune pathway is important for both
immunity and erythropoiesis via its effects through IL-23 receptors (IL-23R).
However, the impact of IL-23R variants on SMA has not been fully elucidated.
METHODS: Since variation within the coding region of IL-23R may influence the
pathogenesis of SMA, the association between IL-23R rs1884444 (G/T), rs7530511
(C/T), and SMA (Hb < 6.0 g/dL) was examined in children (n = 369, aged
6-36 months) with P. falciparum malaria in a holoendemic P. falciparum
transmission area.
RESULTS: Logistic regression analysis, controlling for confounding factor of
anemia, revealed that individual genotypes of IL-23R rs1884444 (G/T) [GT;
OR = 1.34, 95% CI = 0.78-2.31, P = 0.304 and TT; OR = 2.02, 95% CI = 0.53-7.74,
P = 0.286] and IL-23R rs7530511 (C/T) [CT; OR = 2.6, 95% CI = 0.59-11.86,
P = 0.202 and TT; OR = 1.66, 95% CI = 0.84-3.27, P = 0.142] were not associated
with susceptibility to SMA. However, carriage of IL-23R rs1884444T/rs7530511T
(TT) haplotype, consisting of both mutant alleles, was associated with increased 
susceptibility to SMA (OR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.07-4.19, P = 0.030).
CONCLUSION: Results presented here demonstrate that a haplotype of non-synonymous
IL-23R variants increase susceptibility to SMA in children of a holoendemic P.
falciparum transmission area.

Beira Interior (Beira Interior University), Lisbon, Portugal.

Background: Increasing numbers of expatriates are working in sub-Saharan Africa. 
There is little published data on the complex population and this survey aimed at
understanding expatriate morbidity by accessing self-reported health problems and
malaria preventive practices.
Methods: A cross-sectional web-based survey was conducted targeting Portuguese
expatriates in Angola and Mozambique. Logistic regression analysis explored
factors associated with self-reported health problems and psychological symptoms 
in the previous 3 months.
Results: A total sample of 352 adult Portuguese urban civil occupational
expatriates was obtained. Median length of expatriation was 3 years. Considering 
a 3-month timeframe, one in five expatriates reported new health problems and
need of medical assistance, 5% were hospitalized and 64% reported general
psychological symptoms. Less than 2% of subjects were on malaria
chemoprophylaxis. Having chronic health conditions doubled the reporting of new
health problems. Increasing length of expatriation was associated with decreasing
reporting of general psychological symptoms. Directors and executive managers and
expatriates living alone tended to report more general psychological symptoms.
Conclusion: Expatriate communities deserve enhanced surveillance for the health
issues that affect them. This will improve evidence-based preparation and
intervention by public and travel health practitioners.

OBJECTIVE: Malaria is a prime public health threat in developing countries like
India. There is an unmet need of a simplified methodology for the purpose of
triage and provision of intensive care to the severely infected patients in these
areas.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We did a prospective study in patients (n=60) admitted
with severe malaria in a single tertiary care center in the state of Haryana,
India. We assessed the role of coma acidosis malaria (CAM) score in these
patients when predicting mortality and morbidity events. Stepwise logistic
regression analysis was applied to identify patients requiring intensive care
based on the CAM score, and the prediction value of the scoring system was
assessed among these patients.
RESULTS: Cerebral malaria (measured using the Glasgow coma scale) and acidosis
(base deficit) were the major determinants of the CAM score. Serum bicarbonate
levels and respiratory rates were assessed as the proxy markers of the base
deficit as it is not always available. Morbidity increased steadily as the CAM
scores increased. Sensitivity and negative predictive value of 100% depicted that
the scoring system was able to identify patients who needed intensive care and
accurately exclude the patients who could be conservatively managed in the ward. 
Positive predictive values of 73.9%, 68%, and 80.9% indicated that CAM,
bicarbonate-based CAM (BCAM), and respiratory rate-based CAM (RCAM) scores,
respectively, could precisely predict the morbidity and mortality events among
patients with CAM scores ≥2.
CONCLUSION: CAM scores have precise predictive values in assessing patients with 
severe malaria. The scoring system helps in accurate and systemic triage of
patients, irrespective of species, and directs the treating physicians toward
vigilant treatment and emergency care.

INTRODUCTION: Fever in malaria endemic areas, has been shown to strongly predict 
malaria infection and is a key symptom influencing malaria treatment. WHO
recommended confirmation testing for Plasmodium spp. before initiation of
antimalarials due to increased evidence of the decrease of morbidity and
mortality from malaria, decreased malaria associated fever, and increased
evidence of high prevalence of non-malaria fever. To immediately diagnose and
promptly offer appropriate management, caretakers of children with fever should
seek care where these services can be offered; in health facilities.
OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to describe healthcare seeking behaviors
among caretakers of febrile under five years, in Tanzania. And to determine
children's, household and community-level factors associated with parents'
healthcare seeking behavior in health facilities.
METHODS: Secondary data analysis was done using the Tanzania HIV and Malaria
Indicator Surveys (THMIS) 2011-2012. Three-level mixed effects logistic
regression was used to assess children's, household and community-level factors
associated with appropriate healthcare seeking behavior among care takers of
febrile children as well as differentiating between household and community
variabilities.
RESULTS: Of the 8573 children under the age of five years surveyed, 1,675(19.5%) 
had a history of fever two weeks preceding the survey. Of these, 951 (56.8%)
sought appropriate healthcare. Febrile children aged less than a year have 2.7
times higher odds of being taken to the health facilities compared to children
with two or more years of age. (OR: 2.7; 95%CI: 1.50-4.88). Febrile children from
households headed by female caretakers have almost three times higher odds of
being taken to the health facilities (OR: 2.85; 95%CI; 1.41-5.74) compared to
households headed by men. Febrile children with caretakers exposed to mass media 
(radio, television and newspaper) have more than two times higher odds of being
taken to health facilities compared to those not exposed to mass media. Febrile
children from regions with malaria prevalence above national level have 41% less 
odds of being taken to health facilities (OR: 0.49; 95%CI: 0.29-0.84) compared to
those febrile children coming from areas with malaria prevalence below the
national level. Furthermore, febrile children coming from areas with higher
community education levels have 57% (OR: 1.57; 95%CI: 1.14-2.15) higher odds of
being taken to health facilities compared to their counterparts coming from areas
with low levels of community education.
CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION: To effectively and appropriately manage and
control febrile illnesses, the low proportion of febrile children taken to health
facilities by their caretakers should be addressed through frequent advocacy of
the importance of appropriate healthcare seeking behavior, using mass media
particularly in areas with high malaria prevalence. Multifaceted approach needs
to be used in malaria control and eradication as multiple factors are associated 
with appropriate healthcare seeking behavior.

BACKGROUND: Malaria is the main cause of morbidity and mortality among children
under the age of five years in Malawi. The aim of this study was to compare the
prevalence and factors associated with malaria parasitaemia among children under 
the age of five years in Malawi between the 2014 and 2012 Malaria Indicator
Surveys (MISs).
METHODOLOGY: Data on demographic factors, vector control interventions, and blood
for malaria test were collected from a representative sample of children under
the age of five years in Malawi through multistage cluster sampling method. Data 
were analysed by chi-square test and logistic regression using complex samples
analysis of the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22.
RESULTS: The prevalence of malaria parasitaemia among children under the age of
five years increased from 28% in 2012 to 33% in 2014 (p > 0.05). Likewise, the
proportion of children using long-lasting insecticide-treated net (LLIN)
increased significantly from 54% in 2012 to 65% in 2014 MIS (p < 0.05). The
proportion of households that had used indoor residual spraying (IRS) was 9% for 
both surveys. In multivariate analysis, use of LLIN significantly predicted for
malaria parasitaemia in the 2012 MIS but not in the 2014 MIS. Older children and 
those coming from the poorest families were significantly associated with having 
malaria parasites in both surveys.
CONCLUSION: The increase in the use of LLIN among children in 2014, did not
result in the reduction of malaria parasitaemia in children. The use of LLIN
significantly predicted for malaria parasitaemia among children in the 2012 MIS
but not in the 2014 MIS. The results of this study underscore the need to
increase the coverage of IRS, mosquito repellents and larvicide alongside LLINs
in order to reduce the burden of malaria among children in Malawi.

BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis and prompt malaria treatment is essential to reduce
progression of the illness to severe disease and, therefore, decrease mortality
particularly among children under 5 years of age. This study assessed perception 
of malaria and treatment-seeking behaviour for children under five with fever in 
the last 2 weeks in Mandura District, West Ethiopia.
METHODS: A community based cross-sectional study was conducted among 491
caregivers of children under five in Mandura District, West Ethiopia in December 
2014. Data were collected using interviewer-administered questionnaires. Data
were entered into Epi Info version 7 and analysed using SPSS version 20. Multiple
logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify the determinants of
caregivers' treatment-seeking behaviour.
RESULTS: Overall, 94.1% of the respondents perceived that fever is the most
common symptom and 70% associated mosquito bite with the occurrence of malaria.
Of 197 caregivers with under five children with fever in the last 2 weeks
preceding the study 87.8% sought treatment. However, only 38.7% received
treatment within 24 h of onset of fever. Determinants of treatment-seeking
include place of residence (rural/urban) (AOR 2.80, 95% CI 1.01-7.70), caregivers
age (AOR 3.40, 95% CI 1.27-9.10), knowledge of malaria (AOR 4.65, 95% CI
1.38-15.64), perceived susceptibility to malaria (AOR 3.63, 95% CI 1.21-10.88),
and perceived barrier to seek treatment (AOR 0.18, 95% CI 0.06-0.52).
CONCLUSIONS: Majority of the respondents of this study sought treatment for their
under five children. However, a considerable number of caregivers first consulted
traditional healers and tried home treatment, thus, sought treatment late. Living
in rural village, caregivers' age, malaria knowledge, perceived susceptibility to
malaria and perceived barrier to seek treatment were important factors in seeking
health care. There is a need to focus on targeted interventions, promote
awareness and prevention, and address misconceptions about childhood febrile
illness.

BACKGROUND: The protective effect of insecticide-treated bed nets against
individual-level malaria transmission is well known, however community-level
effects are less understood. Protective effects from community-level bed net use 
against malaria transmission have been observed in clinical trials, however, the 
relationship is less clear outside of a controlled research setting. The
objective of this research was to investigate the effect of community-level bed
net use against malaria transmission outside of a bed net clinical trial setting 
in Lilongwe, Malawi following national efforts to scale-up ownership of
long-lasting, insecticide-treated bed nets.
METHODS: An annual, cross-sectional, household-randomized, malaria transmission
intensity survey was conducted in Lilongwe, Malawi (2011-2013). Health,
demographic, and geographic-location data were collected. Participant blood
samples were tested for Plasmodium falciparum presence. The percentage of people 
sleeping under a bed net within 400-m and 1-km radii of all participants was
measured. Mixed effects logistic regression models were used to measure the
relationship between malaria prevalence and surrounding bed net coverage. Each
year, 800 people were enrolled (400 <5 years; 200 5-19 years; 200 ≥20 years;
total n = 2400).
RESULTS: From 2011 to 2013, malaria prevalence declined from 12.9 to 5.6%, while 
bed net use increased from 53.8 to 78.6%. For every 1% increase in community bed 
net coverage, malaria prevalence decreased among children under 5 years old
[adjusted odds ratio: 0.98 (0.96, 1.00)]. Similar effects were observed in
participants 5-19 years [unadjusted odds ratio: 0.98 (0.97, 1.00)]; the effect
was attenuated after adjusting for individual-level bed net use. Community
coverage was not associated with malaria prevalence among adults ≥20 years.
Supplemental analyses identified more pronounced indirect protective effects from
community-level bed net use against malaria transmission among children under
5 years who were sleeping under a bed net [adjusted odds ratio: 0.97 (0.94,
0.99)], compared to children who were not sleeping under a bed net [adjusted odds
ratio: 0.99 (0.97, 1.01)].
CONCLUSIONS: Malawi's efforts to scale up ownership of long-lasting,
insecticide-treated bed nets are effective in increasing reported use. Increased 
community-level bed net coverage appears to provide additional protection against
malaria transmission beyond individual use in a real-world context.

Background: The performance of Plasmodium falciparum-specific histidine-rich
protein 2-based rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) to evaluate suspected malaria in
low-endemicity settings has not been well characterized.
Methods: Using dried blood spot samples from patients with suspected malaria at
37 health facilities from 2012 to 2014 in the low-endemicity country of
Swaziland, we investigated the diagnostic accuracy of histidine-rich protein
2-based RDTs using qualitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (nested PCR
targeting the cytochrome b gene) and quantitative PCR as reference standards. To 
explore reasons for false-negative and/or false-positive results, we used
pfhrp2/3-specific PCR and logistic regression analyses of potentially associated 
epidemiological factors.
Results: From 1353 patients, 93.0% of RDT-positive (n = 185) and 31.2% of
RDT-negative samples (n = 340) were available and selected for testing. Compared 
with nested PCR, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV),
and negative predictive value (NPV) of RDTs were 51.7%, 94.1%, 67.3%, and 89.1%, 
respectively. After exclusion of samples with parasite densities <100/μL, which
accounted for 75.7% of false-negative results and 33.3% of PCR-detectable
infections, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were 78.8%, 93.7%, 62.3%, 
and 97.1%. Deletions of pfhrp2 were not detected. False-positivity was more
likely during the second year and was not associated with demographics, recent
malaria, health facility testing characteristics, or potential DNA degradation.
Conclusions: In the low-transmission setting of Swaziland, we demonstrated low
sensitivity of RDT for malaria diagnosis, owing to an unexpectedly high
proportion of low-density infection among symptomatic subjects. The PPV was also 
low, requiring further investigation. A more accurate point-of-care diagnostic
may be needed to support malaria elimination efforts.

BACKGROUND: Malaria in pregnancy is common in sub-Saharan Africa where it
contributes to perinatal morbidity and mortality. Use of insecticide-treated bed 
nets and intermittent preventive therapy with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine during
pregnancy are effective but underutilized interventions to prevent infection.
Factors associated with bed net ownership and usage, and use of prophylaxis among
recently pregnant women in Cameroon were investigated.
METHODS: National data from the 2011 Cameroon Demographic Health Survey was used 
to identify women with a pregnancy within the previous 5 years. Logistic
regression models were created to assess for independent predictors of reported
bed net ownership, bed net usage, and the use of malaria prophylaxis medications 
during pregnancy.
RESULTS: Nearly one in two women surveyed had a recent pregnancy (n = 7647). In
this group, bed net ownership and usage rates were low (33.7 and 16.9%,
respectively); 61.6% used medication for malaria prophylaxis during pregnancy.
Bed net ownership and usage were associated with maternal literacy (aOR 1.4 for
net usage, 95% CI 1.1-1.8) and the presence of children under age 5 in the home
(aOR 2.3 for net usage, 95% CI 1.6-3.3). The use of malaria prophylaxis
medication was associated with measures of healthcare access (aOR 17.8, 95% CI
13-24.5 for ≥4 antenatal care visits), higher maternal education (aOR 1.5, 95% CI
1.1-2.1) and maternal literacy (aOR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1-1.7).
CONCLUSIONS: Women in Cameroon and their antenatal providers missed many
opportunities to prevent malaria in pregnancy. Efforts toward ensuring universal 
bed net provision, consistent antenatal care and the education of girls are
likely to improve birth outcomes attributable to malaria infection.

BACKGROUND: The level of traditional medicine use, particularly Jamu use, in
Indonesia is substantial. Indonesians do not always seek timely treatment for
malaria and may seek self-medication via traditional medicine. This paper reports
findings from the first focused analyses of traditional medicine use for malaria 
in Indonesia and the first such analyses worldwide to draw upon a large sample of
respondents across high-risk malaria endemic areas.
METHODS: A sub-study of the Indonesia Basic Health Research/Riskesdas Study 2010 
focused on 12,226 adults aged 15 years and above residing in high-risk
malaria-endemic provinces. Logistic regression was undertaken to determine the
significant associations for traditional medicine use for malaria symptoms.
FINDINGS: Approximately one in five respondents use traditional medicine for
malaria symptoms and the vast majority experiencing multiple episodes of malaria 
use traditional medicine alongside free antimalarial drug treatments. Respondents
consuming traditional medicine for general health/common illness purposes every
day (odds ratio: 3.75, 95% Confidence Interval: 2.93 4.79), those without a
hospital in local vicinity (odds ratio: 1.31, 95% Confidence Interval: 1.10
1.57), and those living in poorer quality housing, were more likely to use
traditional medicine for malaria symptoms.
CONCLUSION: A substantial percentage of those with malaria symptoms utilize
traditional medicine for treating their malaria symptoms. In order to promote
safe and effective malaria treatment, all providing malaria care in Indonesia
need to enquire with their patients about possible traditional medicine use.

BACKGROUND: Soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) and Plasmodium falciparum
infections remain public health problems in Cameroon. A cross-sectional study was
carried out in the Mount Cameroon area to determine the prevalence and intensity 
of STHs and P. falciparum infections in individuals living in different
agroecosystems; to assess the influence of these infections on haematological
parameters; and to identify the risk factors associated with STH infections.
METHODS: STH and malaria parasites were detected using the Kato-Katz method and
Giemsa staining of blood films, respectively. Complete blood count values were
obtained using an automatic haematology analyser. Soil samples were analysed
using the sucrose floatation sedimentation method. Categorical and continuous
variables were compared as required and logistic regression models were used to
assess the risk factors for STH infections and anaemia.
RESULTS: Of the 450 participants examined, STHs, P. falciparum and mixed
co-infections were detected in 14.0, 33.3 and 5.6% of participants, respectively.
Significantly higher prevalences of Ascaris (18.8%) and Trichuris (7.9%)
infections were observed in participants from tea plantation areas compared to
those from banana and palm plantation areas, with similar trends in egg density. 
P. falciparum prevalence and parasite density were comparable between the
different agroecosystems. The overall prevalence of anaemia was 64.2%. The
prevalence of haematological manifestations such as moderate (48.0%) and severe
(8.0%) anaemia, leucopenia (26.9%) and microcytosis (30.8%) was significantly
higher among Plasmodium-STH co-infected participants. Soil samples from
plantations showed the highest prevalences of STH eggs compared to soil samples
from areas around pit toilets and public water taps. Living in a tea plantation
area (OR = 3.07), age (AOR = 1.49) and lack of access to potable water
(OR = 2.25) were identified as risk factors for STH infections, while the age
groups 15-25 years (OR = 2.928) and 26-35 years (OR = 2.832), and being female
(OR = 2.671) were significant risk factors for anaemia.
CONCLUSIONS: STHs, malaria and anaemia are still of public health concern in
plantation communities. Co-infections negatively influence haematological
parameters. The tea farming agroecosystem, age and lack of access to potable
water were identified as significant risk factors for STH infections.

BACKGROUND: Malaria is a serious health concern in Africa. In Cameroon, an
endemic country where malaria remains a major public health problem, several
control measures have been put in place among which the use of
insecticide-treated bednets (LLINs/ITNs) is considered one of the core vector
control strategies. However, the greatest challenges include ownership and
utilisation by individuals and households. Factors such as age, marital status,
gender, education and occupation of the household head, household size, knowledge
of bednets, socioeconomic status, and environmental factors have been suggested
to have an impact on bednet ownership and utilisation in different settings. The 
present study sought to determine bednet ownership and utilisation rates and to
assess the impact of predictive factors on bednet ownership and use in the
Bamenda Health District (BHD) of Cameroon.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study involving 384 households was conducted in six
health areas in the BHD. A structured and semi-structured questionnaire was used 
to collect data on demographic and household characteristics as well as
information on their bednet ownership and utilisation. Descriptive statistics,
bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed.
RESULTS: Frequency of bednet ownership was relatively high (63.5%) with LLINs
being most abundant (91.9%); the majority of households (87.7%) obtained their
bednets during the 2011 free distribution campaign. Utilisation was relatively
high (69.3%), with negligence (29.3%) and heat discomfort (26.7%) accounting most
for non-usage of bednets. Children less than 5 years (63%) and pregnant women
(60%) most often used these nets. Households headed by a married couple, those
with older household heads, household with smaller size (5-12 persons), and
knowledge of bednets (good knowledge) had positive impacts on bednet ownership
(p < 0.05). The gender of the household head (males), their educational level,
environmental conditions (presence of suitable mosquito breeding sites), bednet
number in households (greater number of bednets) and the prioritised groups
(children < 5 and pregnant women) had positive impacts on bednet utilisation in
households (p < 0.05). There was a negative association between bednet ownership 
and utilisation by households as bednet ownership was high and utilisation of
these nets was low. Marital status and age of household head, household size, and
knowledge of bednets had impacts on bednet ownership while gender and educational
level of the household head, environmental suitability, the number of bednets and
the two prioritised groups had an impact on bednet usage.
CONCLUSION: These factors may be relevant for policy makers and in decision
making for the intensification of campaign strategies to ensure more effective
subsequent distribution campaigns in the BHD and beyond.

OBJECTIVE: In Togo, substantial progress in maternal and child health is needed
to reach global development goals. To better inform clinic and community-based
health services, this study identifies factors associated with maternal and child
health care utilization in the Kara region of Northern Togo.
METHODS: We conducted a population-representative household survey of four health
clinic catchment areas of 1,075 women of reproductive age in 2015. Multivariable 
logistic regression was used to model individual and structural factors
associated with utilization of four maternal and child health services. Key
outcomes were: facility-based delivery, maternal postnatal health check by a
health professional within the first six weeks of birth, childhood vaccination,
and receipt of malaria medication for febrile children under age five within 72
hours of symptom onset.
RESULTS: 83 percent of women who gave birth in the last 2 years delivered at a
health facility. In adjusted models, the strongest predictor of facility delivery
in the rural catchment areas was proximity to a health center, with women living 
under three kilometers having 3.7 (95% CI 1.7, 7.9) times the odds of a facility 
birth. Only 11 percent of women received a health check by a health provider at
any time in the postnatal period. Postnatal health checks were less likely for
women in the poorest households and for women who resided in rural areas.
Children of polygamous mothers had half the odds of receiving malaria medication 
for fever within 72 hours of symptom onset, while children with increased
household wealth status had increased odds of childhood vaccination and receiving
treatment for malaria.
CONCLUSION: Our analysis highlights the importance of risk stratification
analysis to inform the delivery and scope of maternal and child health programs
needed to reach those with the least access to care.

BACKGROUND: Malaria is the leading cause of death among children in Mozambique.
Prevalence and factors associated with malaria are not well studied among
children in rural Zambézia Province. Whether prevalence of malaria varies across 
diverse districts within the province is unknown.
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of female heads of household was conducted
during April and May 2014, a period of peak malaria transmission. Data were
collected on up to two randomly selected children aged 6-59 months per household.
The outcome of interest was self-report of symptomatic malaria confirmed by
diagnostic test in the past 30 days. Analyses accounted for the two-stage cluster
sample design. Prevalence of symptomatic malaria was calculated for the province 
and three over-sampled focus districts-Alto Molócuè, Morrumbala, and Namacurra.
Multivariable logistic regression of symptomatic malaria diagnosis included:
district, age, sex, education, bed net use, urban setting, distance to health
facility, income, roofing material, and pig farming.
RESULTS: Data were collected on 2540 children. Fifty percent were female, and the
median age was 24 months. Sixty percent of children slept under bed nets the
night prior to the survey, but utilization varied between districts (range
49-89%; p < 0.001). Forty-three percent of children reported fever in the past
30 days, 91% of those sought care at a health facility, 67% of those had either a
malaria rapid diagnostic test or blood smear, and 67% of those had a positive
test result and therefore met our case definition of self-reported symptomatic
malaria. There were significant differences in prevalence of fever (p < 0.001),
health-seeking (p < 0.001), and diagnostic testing (p = 0.003) between focus
districts. Province-wide prevalence of symptomatic malaria was 13% and among
focus districts ranged from 14% in Morrumbala to 17% in Namacurra (p < 0.001).
Higher female caregiver education (OR 1.88; 95% CI 1.31-2.70), having fewer young
children in the household (OR 1.25; 95% CI 1.01-1.56), and higher income (OR
1.56; 95% CI 1.11-2.22) were independently associated with having a child with
symptomatic malaria.
CONCLUSIONS: Self-reported symptomatic malaria is highly prevalent among children
in Zambézia Province, Mozambique and varies significantly between diverse
districts. Factors facilitating access to health services are associated with
symptomatic malaria diagnosis. These findings should inform resource allocation
in the fight against malaria in Mozambique.

BACKGROUND: Young children bear the world's highest prevalence of anaemia, the
majority of which is of multifactorial aetiology, which in turn hampers its
successful prevention. Even moderate degrees of anaemia are associated with
increased mortality and morbidity. Despite this evidence, there is a lack of
effective preventive programs and absence of consensus in the safety of iron
supplementation in malaria areas, which reflects the poor understanding of the
contribution of different aetiologies to anaemia. In order to reduce the anaemia 
burden in the most vulnerable population, a study to determine the aetiology of
anaemia among pre-school Mozambican children was performed.
METHODS: We undertook a case-control study of 443 preschool hospitalized children
with anaemia (haemoglobin concentration <11 g/dl) and 289 community controls
without anaemia. Inclusion criteria were: age 1-59 months, no blood transfusion
in the previous month, residence in the study area and signed informed consent.
Both univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to
identify factors associated with anaemia and adjusted attributable fractions
(AAF) were estimated when appropriate.
RESULTS: Malaria (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 8.39, p < 0.0001; AAF = 37%),
underweight (AOR = 8.10, p < 0.0001; AAF = 43%), prealbumin deficiency
(AOR = 7.11, p < 0.0001; AAF = 77%), albumin deficiency (AOR = 4.29, p = 0.0012; 
AAF = 30%), HIV (AOR = 5.73, p = 0.0060; AAF = 18%), and iron deficiency
(AOR = 4.05, p < 0.0001; AAF = 53%) were associated with anaemia. Vitamin A
deficiency and α-thalassaemia were frequent (69% and 64%, respectively in cases) 
but not independently related to anaemia. Bacteraemia (odds ratio (OR) = 8.49,
p = 0.004), Parvovirus-B19 (OR = 6.05, p = 0.017) and Epstein-Barr virus
(OR = 2.10, p = 0.0015) infections were related to anaemia only in the unadjusted
analysis. Neither vitamin B12 deficiency nor intestinal parasites were associated
with anaemia. Folate deficiency was not observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Undernutrition, iron deficiency, malaria, and HIV are main factors
related to anaemia in hospitalised Mozambican preschool children. Effective
programs and strategies for the prevention and management of these conditions
need to be reinforced. Specifically, prevention of iron deficiency that accounted
in this study for more than half of anaemia cases would have a high impact in
reducing the burden of anaemia in children living under similar conditions.
However this deficiency, a common preventable and treatable condition, remains
neglected by the international public health community.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence, etiology and outcome of Cardiorenal
syndrome (CRS) in hospitalized children.
METHODS: A prospective cohort study was carried out in 242 children between 6 mo 
to 18 y of age hospitalized with primary cardiac, renal or any systemic disorder 
at a tertiary care center in India. The primary outcome was the development of
CRS. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed to
determine the risk of mortality secondary to CRS.
RESULTS: Among 242 children, 67 (27.7%) children developed CRS and the rest 175
(72.3%) did not. Among those with CRS, 40.3%, 20.9%, and 38.8% had CRS-1, 3 and
5, respectively. Cardiac diseases leading to CRS were myocarditis (40.7%)
followed by congenital heart disease (25.9%), rheumatic heart disease (18.5%),
and dilated cardiomyopathy (7.4%); renal disease associated with CRS was acute
glomerulonephritis (100%) and major systemic disorders leading to CRS were
septicemia (53.8%), malaria (23.1%), scrub typhus (7.7%), and acute
gastroenteritis (3.8%). The occurrence of CRS was associated with an increased
risk of mortality (OR 6.3, 95% CI: 2.8, 14.1; p 0.000). A subgroup analysis
revealed that children with CRS having acute kidney injury stage 2 and 3 also had
a higher risk of mortality (p 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of CRS is quite high in children with cardiac, renal
or systemic diseases and is associated with a significant risk of mortality.
Children presenting with these illnesses should be monitored for the occurrence
of CRS so that early intervention may reduce mortality.

BACKGROUND: Improvements to housing may contribute to malaria control and
elimination by reducing house entry by malaria vectors and thus exposure to
biting. We tested the hypothesis that the odds of malaria infection are lower in 
modern, improved housing compared to traditional housing in sub-Saharan Africa
(SSA).
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We analysed 15 Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and 14 
Malaria Indicator Surveys (MIS) conducted in 21 countries in SSA between 2008 and
2015 that measured malaria infection by microscopy or rapid diagnostic test
(RDT). DHS/MIS surveys record whether houses are built with finished materials
(e.g., metal) or rudimentary materials (e.g., thatch). This information was used 
to develop a binary housing quality variable where houses built using finished
wall, roof, and floor materials were classified as "modern", and all other houses
were classified as "traditional". Conditional logistic regression was used to
determine the association between housing quality and prevalence of malaria
infection in children aged 0-5 y, adjusting for age, gender, insecticide-treated 
net (ITN) use, indoor residual spraying, household wealth, and geographic
cluster. Individual survey odds ratios (ORs) were combined to determine a summary
OR using a random effects meta-analysis. Of 284,532 total children surveyed,
139,318 were tested for malaria infection using microscopy (n = 131,652) or RDT
(n = 138,540). Within individual surveys, malaria prevalence measured by
microscopy ranged from 0.4% (Madagascar 2011) to 45.5% (Burkina Faso 2010) among 
children living in modern houses and from 0.4% (The Gambia 2013) to 70.6%
(Burkina Faso 2010) in traditional houses, and malaria prevalence measured by RDT
ranged from 0.3% (Senegal 2013-2014) to 61.2% (Burkina Faso 2010) in modern
houses and from 1.5% (The Gambia 2013) to 79.8% (Burkina Faso 2010) in
traditional houses. Across all surveys, modern housing was associated with a 9%
to 14% reduction in the odds of malaria infection (microscopy: adjusted OR 0.91, 
95% CI 0.85-0.97, p = 0.003; RDT: adjusted OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.80-0.92, p < 0.001).
This association was consistent regardless of ITN usage. As a comparison, the
odds of malaria infection were 15% to 16% lower among ITN users versus non-users 
(microscopy: adjusted OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.79-0.90, p < 0.001; RDT: adjusted OR
0.85, 95% CI 0.80-0.90, p < 0.001). The main limitation of this study is that
residual confounding by household wealth of the observed association between
housing quality and malaria prevalence is possible, since the wealth index may
not have fully captured differences in socioeconomic position; however, the use
of multiple national surveys offers the advantage of a large sample size and the 
elimination of many biases typically associated with pooling observational data.
CONCLUSIONS: Housing quality is an important risk factor for malaria infection
across the spectrum of malaria endemicity in SSA, with a strength of association 
between housing quality and malaria similar to that observed between ITN use and 
malaria. Improved housing should be considered a promising intervention for
malaria control and elimination and long-term prevention of reintroduction.

In zones of violent conflict in the tropics, social disruption leads to elevated 
child mortality, of which malaria is the leading cause. Understanding the social 
determinants of malaria transmission may be helpful to optimize malaria control
efforts. We conducted a cross-sectional study of healthy children aged 2 months
to 5 years attending well-child and/or immunization visits in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC). Six hundred and forty-seven children were tested for
malaria antigenemia by rapid diagnostic test and the accompanying parent or legal
guardian simultaneously completed a survey questionnaire related to demographics,
socioeconomic status, maternal education, as well as bednet use and recent
febrile illness. We examined the associations between variables using
multivariable logistic regression analysis, chi-squared statistic, Fisher's exact
test, and Spearman's rank correlation, as appropriate. One hundred and
twenty-three out of the 647 (19%) children in the study tested positive for
malaria. Higher levels of maternal education were associated with a lower risk of
malaria in their children. The prevalence of malaria in children of mothers with 
no education, primary school, and beyond primary was 41/138 (30%), 41/241 (17%), 
and 39/262 (15%), respectively (p = 0.001). In a multivariable logistic
regression model adjusting for the effect of a child's age and study site, the
following remained significant predictors of malaria antigenemia: maternal
education, number of children under five per household, and HIV serostatus.
Higher maternal education, through several putative causal pathways, was
associated with lower malaria prevalence among children in the DRC. Our findings 
suggest that maternal education might be an effective 'social vaccine' against
malaria in the DRC and globally.

BACKGROUND: A key component of malaria elimination campaigns is the
identification and targeting of high risk populations. To characterize high risk 
populations in north central Namibia, a prospective health facility-based
case-control study was conducted from December 2012-July 2014. Cases (n = 107)
were all patients presenting to any of the 46 health clinics located in the study
districts with a confirmed Plasmodium infection by multi-species rapid diagnostic
test (RDT). Population controls (n = 679) for each district were RDT negative
individuals residing within a household that was randomly selected from a census 
listing using a two-stage sampling procedure. Demographic, travel,
socio-economic, behavioural, climate and vegetation data were also collected.
Spatial patterns of malaria risk were analysed. Multivariate logistic regression 
was used to identify risk factors for malaria.
RESULTS: Malaria risk was observed to cluster along the border with Angola, and
travel patterns among cases were comparatively restricted to northern Namibia and
Angola. Travel to Angola was associated with excessive risk of malaria in males
(OR 43.58 95% CI 2.12-896), but there was no corresponding risk associated with
travel by females. This is the first study to reveal that gender can modify the
effect of travel on risk of malaria. Amongst non-travellers, male gender was also
associated with a higher risk of malaria compared with females (OR 1.95 95% CI
1.25-3.04). Other strong risk factors were sleeping away from the household the
previous night, lower socioeconomic status, living in an area with moderate
vegetation around their house, experiencing moderate rainfall in the month prior 
to diagnosis and living <15 km from the Angolan border.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the critical need to target malaria
interventions to young male travellers, who have a disproportionate risk of
malaria in northern Namibia, to coordinate cross-border regional malaria
prevention initiatives and to scale up coverage of prevention measures such as
indoor residual spraying and long-lasting insecticide nets in high risk areas if 
malaria elimination is to be realized.

BACKGROUND: Malaria is one of the most prevalent parasitic diseases in the world 
and represents a threat to travellers visiting endemic areas. Chemoprophylaxis is
the prevention measure used in travel medicine, avoiding clinical manifestations 
and protecting against the development of severe disease and death.
METHODS: Retrospective and descriptive analysis of malaria prevention data in
travellers was recorded from a travel medicine clinic in São Paulo, Brazil,
between January 2006 and December 2010. All the medical records of travellers,
who had travelled to areas with risk of disease transmission, including Brazil,
were analysed. Demographic characteristics of travellers, travel details and
recommendations for preventing malaria were also seen.
RESULTS: During the study period, 2836 pre-travel consultations were carried out 
on 2744 individuals (92 were consulted twice). The most common reasons for
travelling were tourism and work. The most common destinations were Africa
(24.5%), Europe (21.2%), Asia (16.6%) and locations within Brazil (14.9%). In
general prophylaxis against malaria was recommended in 10.3% of all the
consultations. African destinations vs Asian, Brazilian and other destinations
and length of stay ≤30 days were independently associated with the higher odds of
chemoprophylaxis recommendation after the logistic regression.
CONCLUSION: The prophylaxis against malaria was recommended in 10.3% of the
consultations. The authors believe that a coherent measure of malaria prevention 
in Brazil and for international travellers would be to recommend for all parts of
the North Brazil, avoidance of mosquito bites and immediate consultation of a
physician in case of fever during or after the journey is recommended.

BACKGROUND: Early rising asexual parasitaemia (ERAP), initially defined as 'an
increase in the parasite count over the baseline pre-treatment level during the
first 24 h of treatment' of falciparum malaria with artemisinin derivatives is
well documented, but there is no characterization of its risk factors, kinetics, 
molecular features or relationship to late-appearing anaemia (LAA) in acute
falciparum malaria in African children following oral artemisinin-based
combination therapies (ACTs).
METHODS: ERAP was defined as ≥5% increase in pre-treatment parasitaemia within
8 h of initiating treatment. Parasitaemia was quantified pre-treatment and 1-2
hourly for 8 h, and less frequently thereafter for 6 weeks following randomized
treatment of acutely malarious children with artesunate-amodiaquine,
artemether-lumefantrine or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. Risk factors were
determined by stepwise multiple logistic regression model. Kinetics of release
into and of elimination of asexual parasites and DNA clones from peripheral blood
were evaluated by method of residuals and non-compartment model, respectively.
Parasite population changes were evaluated morphologically and by molecular
genotyping.
RESULTS: ERAP occurred in 205 of 416 children. A parasitaemia <100,000/μL and
parasitaemia 1 day post-treatment initiation were independent predictors of ERAP.
In children with ERAP: mean and peak time of increase in parasitaemia were 105.6%
(95% CI 81-130.1) and 2.5 h (95% CI 2.2-2.7), respectively. Mean lag time,
half-time and rate constant of release were 0.2 h (95% CI 0.2-0.3), 1 h (95% CI
0.9-1.1), and 0.9 h-1 (95% CI 0.8-1), respectively. Schizonts and young
gametocytes were seen only in peripheral blood of few children with ERAP. In
age-, gender-, baseline parasitaemia- and treatment-matched children with and
without ERAP, parasite DNA clearance time and area under curve of number of DNA
clones versus time were significantly higher in children with ERAP indicating
peripheral retention of released parasites followed by elimination. DNA clone
elimination was monoexponential.
CONCLUSION: ERAP is common, occurs rapidly as first order process and may be due 
to mobilization of parasites from deep tissue following a first dose of ACTs of
acute childhood falciparum malaria.

BACKGROUND: It is widely acknowledged that modifications to existing control
interventions are required if South Africa is to achieve malaria elimination.
Targeting indoor residual spraying (IRS) to areas where cases have been detected 
is one strategy currently under investigation in northeastern South Africa. This 
seroprevalence baseline study, nested within a targeted IRS trial, was undertaken
to provide insights into malaria transmission dynamics in South Africa and
evaluate whether sero-epidemiological practices have the potential to be
routinely incorporated into elimination programmes.
METHODS: Filter-paper blood spots, demographic and household survey data were
collected from 2710 randomly selected households in 56 study wards located in the
municipalities of Ba-Phalaborwa and Bushbuckridge. Blood spots were assayed for
Plasmodium falciparum apical membrane antigen-1 and merozoite surface protein-119
blood-stage antigens using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Seroprevalence
data were analysed using a reverse catalytic model to determine malaria
seroconversion rates (SCR). Geospatial cluster analysis was used to investigate
transmission heterogeneity while random effects logistic regression identified
risk factors associated with malaria exposure.
RESULTS: The overall SCR across the entire study site was 0.012 (95% CI
0.008-0.017) per year. Contrasting SCRs, corresponding to distinct geographical
regions across the study site, ranging from <0.001 (95% CI <0.001-0.005) to 0.022
(95% CI 0.008-0.062) per annum revealed prominent transmission heterogeneity.
Geospatial cluster analysis of household seroprevalence and age-adjusted antibody
responses detected statistically significant (p < 0.05) spatial clusters of P.
falciparum exposure. Formal secondary education was associated with lower malaria
exposure in the sampled population (AOR 0.72, 95% CI 0.56-0.95, p = 0.018).
CONCLUSIONS: Although overall transmission intensity and exposure to malaria was 
low across both study sites, malaria transmission intensity was highly
heterogeneous and associated with low socio-economic status in the region.
Findings suggest focal targeting of interventions has the potential to be an
appropriate strategy to deploy in South Africa. Furthermore, routinely
incorporating sero-epidemiological practices into elimination programmes may
prove useful in monitoring malaria transmission intensity in South Africa, and
other countries striving for malaria elimination.

BACKGROUND: Appropriate diagnosis and treatment are essential for reducing
malaria mortality. A cross-sectional outpatient health facility (HF) survey was
conducted in southern Malawi from January to March 2015 to determine appropriate 
malaria testing and treatment practices four years after implementation of a
policy requiring diagnostic confirmation before treatment.
METHODS: Enrolled patients were interviewed, examined and had their health
booklet reviewed. Health workers (HWs) were asked about training, supervision and
access to the 2013 national malaria treatment guidelines. HFs were assessed for
malaria diagnostic and treatment capacity. Weighted descriptive analyses and
logistic regression of patient, HW and HF characteristics related to testing and 
treatment were performed.
RESULTS: An evaluation of 105 HFs, and interviews of 150 HWs and 2342 patients
was completed. Of 1427 suspect uncomplicated malaria patients seen at HFs with
testing available, 1072 (75.7%) were tested, and 547 (53.2%) tested positive.
Testing was more likely if patients spontaneously reported fever (odds ratio
(OR) 2.6; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7-4.0), headache (OR 1.5; 95% CI
1.1-2.1) or vomiting (OR 2.0; 95% CI 1.0-4.0) to HWs and less likely if they
reported skin problems (OR 0.4; 95% CI 0.2-0.6). Altogether, 511 (92.7%)
confirmed cases and 98 (60.3%) of 178 presumed uncomplicated malaria patients (at
HFs without testing) were appropriately treated, while 500 (96.6%) of 525
patients with negative tests did not receive anti-malarials. Only eight (5.7%)
suspect severe malaria patients received appropriate pre-referral treatment.
Appropriate treatment was more likely for presumed uncomplicated malaria patients
(at HFs without testing) with elevated temperature (OR 1.5/1 °C increase; 95% CI 
1.1-1.9), who reported fever to HWs (OR 5.7; 95% CI 1.9-17.6), were seen by HWs
with additional supervision visits in the previous 6 months (OR 1.2/additional
visit; 95% CI 1.0-1.4), or were seen by older HWs (OR 1.1/year of age; 95% CI
1.0-1.1).
CONCLUSIONS: Correct testing and treatment practices were reasonably good for
uncomplicated malaria when testing was available. Pre-referral treatment for
suspect severe malaria was unacceptably rare. Encouraging HWs to elicit and
appropriately respond to patient symptoms may improve practices.

BACKGROUND: Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is an X-linked
hereditary enzymatic abnormality that affects more than 400 million people
worldwide. Most deficient individuals do not manifest any symptoms; however,
several precipitant agents-such as fava intake, infections, or several drugs-may 
trigger acute haemolytic anaemia. Countries should be informed of the prevalence 
of this enzymatic anomaly within their borders, in order to make safe and
appropriate national decisions regarding the use of potentially unsafe drugs for 
G6PD deficient individuals.
METHODS: A school-based cross-sectional survey was conducted in three districts
in Mozambique, namely Manhiça, located in the south; Mocuba in the centre; and
Pemba in the northern tip of the country. G6PD deficiency was evaluated using the
CareStart™ diagnostic test, and enzyme activity levels were measured through
fluorescence spectrophotometry in deficient individuals. Chi squared and ANOVA
tests were used to assess prevalence and mean enzyme activity differences, and
logistic regression was used to identify risk factors associated to the
deficiency.
RESULTS: G6PD deficiency prevalence estimates were lowest in the northern city of
Pemba (8.3%) and among Emakhuwas and Shimakondes, and higher in the centre and
southern regions of the country (16.8 and 14.6%, respectively), particularly
among Elomwes and Xichanganas. G6PD deficiency was significantly more prevalent
among male students than females (OR = 1.4, 95% CI 1.0-1.8, p = 0.02), although
enzyme activity levels were not different among deficient individuals from either
gender group. Finally, median deficiency levels were found to be more severe
among the deficient students from the north (0.7 U/gHg [0.2-0.7] p < 0.001) and
south (0.7 U/gHg [0.5-2.5]), compared to those from the centre (1.4 U/gHg
[0.6-2.1]).
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that Mozambique, as a historically high
malaria-endemic country has considerable levels of G6PD deficiency, that vary
significantly across the country. This should be considered when planning
national strategies for the use of licensed drugs that may be associated to
haemolysis among G6PD individuals, or prior to the performance of future trials
using primaquine and other 8-aminoquinolines derivatives. Registration Number

BACKGROUND: Maternal infections are associated with maternal and foetal adverse
outcomes. Nutrient supplementation during pregnancy may reduce the occurrence of 
infections by improving maternal immunity. We aimed to investigate the impact of 
small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplement (SQ-LNS) on the occurrence of
Plasmodium falciparum parasitaemia during pregnancy and trichomoniasis, vaginal
candidiasis and urinary tract infection (UTI) after delivery.
METHODS: Pregnant Malawian women enrolled in the iLiNS-DYAD trial receiving daily
supplementation with SQ-LNS, multiple micronutrients (MMN) or iron & folic acid
(IFA) from <20 gestation weeks (gw) were assessed for P. falciparum parasitaemia 
at 32 gw using rapid diagnostic testing (RDT), at 36 gw using polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) and at delivery using both RDT and PCR; and at one week after
delivery for trichomoniasis and vaginal candidiasis using wet mount microscopy
and for UTI using urine dipstick analysis. The prevalence of each infection by
intervention group was estimated at the prescribed time points and the global
null hypothesis was tested using logistic regression. Adjusted analyses were
performed using preselected covariates.
RESULTS: The prevalence of P. falciparum parasitaemia was 10.7% at 32 gw, 9% at
36 gw, and 8.3% by RDT and 20.2% by PCR at delivery. After delivery the
prevalence of trichomoniasis was 10.5%, vaginal candidiasis was 0.5%, and UTI was
3.1%. There were no differences between intervention groups in the prevalence of 
any of the infections.
CONCLUSION: In this population, SQ-LNS did not influence the occurrence of
maternal P. falciparum parasitaemia, trichomoniasis, vaginal candidiasis or UTI.

BACKGROUND: Long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN) are a highly effective means
for preventing malaria infection and reducing associated morbidity and mortality.
Mass free distribution campaigns have been shown to rapidly increase LLIN
ownership and use. Around 3.5 million LLINs were distributed free of charge in
the Kasaï Occidental Province in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in
September-October 2014, using two different approaches, a fixed delivery strategy
and a door-to-door strategy including hang-up activities.
METHODS: Repeated community-based cross-sectional surveys were conducted 2 months
before and six months after the mass distribution. Descriptive statistics were
used to measure changes in key malaria household indicators. LLIN ownership and
use were compared between delivery strategies. Univariate and multivariate
logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with LLIN
use before and after the mass distribution. A comparative financial cost analysis
between the fixed delivery and door-to-door distribution strategies was carried
out from the provider's perspective.
RESULTS: Household ownership of at least one LLIN increased from 39.4%
pre-campaign to 91.4% post-campaign and LLIN universal coverage, measured as the 
proportion of households with at least one LLIN for every two people increased
from 4.1 to 41.1%. Population access to LLIN within the household increased from 
22.2 to 80.7%, while overall LLIN use increased from 18.0 to 68.3%. Higher LLIN
ownership was achieved with the fixed delivery strategy compared with the
door-to-door (92.5% [95% CI 90.2-94.4%] versus 85.2% [95% CI 78.5-90.0%]), while 
distribution strategy did not have a significant impact on LLIN use (69.6% [95%
CI 63.1-75.5%] versus 65.7% [95% CI 52.7-76.7%]). Malaria prevalence among
children aged 6-59 months was 44.8% post-campaign. Living in a household with
sufficient numbers of LLIN to cover all members was the strongest determinant of 
LLIN use. The total financial cost per LLIN distributed was 6.58 USD for the
fixed distribution strategy and 6.61 USD for the door-to-door strategy.
CONCLUSIONS: The mass distribution campaign was effective for rapidly increasing 
LLIN ownership and use. These gains need to be sustained for long-term reduction 
in malaria burden. The fixed delivery strategy achieved a higher LLIN coverage at
lower delivery cost compared with the door-to-door strategy and seems to be a
better distribution strategy in the context of the present study setting.

BACKGROUND: Tanzania has seen a reduction in the fraction of fevers caused by
malaria, likely due in part to scale-up of control measures. While national
guidelines require parasite-based diagnosis prior to treatment, it is estimated
that more than half of suspected malaria treatment-seeking in Tanzania initiates 
in the private retail sector, where diagnosis by malaria rapid diagnostic test
(RDT) or microscopy is illegal. This pilot study investigated whether the
introduction of RDTs into Accredited Drug Dispensing Outlets (ADDOs) under
realistic market conditions would improve case management practices.
METHODS: Dispensers from ADDOs in two intervention districts in Tanzania were
trained to stock and perform RDTs and monitored quarterly. Each district was
assigned a different recommended retail price to evaluate the need for a subsidy.
Malaria RDT and artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) uptake and
availability were measured pre-intervention and 1 year post-intervention through 
structured surveys of ADDO owners and exiting customers in both intervention
districts and one contiguous control district. Descriptive analysis and logistic 
regression were used to compare the three districts and identify predictive
variables for testing.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: A total of 310 dispensers from 262 ADDOs were trained to 
stock and perform RDTs. RDT availability in intervention ADDOs increased from 1% 
(n = 172) to 73% (n = 163) during the study; ACT medicines were available in 75% 
of 260 pre-intervention and 68% of 254 post-intervention ADDOs. Pre-treatment
testing performed within the ADDO increased from 0 to 65% of suspected malaria
patients who visited a shop (95% CI 60.8-69.6%) with no difference between
intervention districts. Overall parasite-based diagnosis increased from 19 to 74%
in intervention districts and from 3 to 18% in the control district. Prior
knowledge of RDT availability (aOR = 1.9, p = 0.03) and RDT experience
(aOR = 1.9, p = 0.01) were predictors for testing. Adherence data indicated that 
75% of malaria positives received ACT, while 3% of negatives received ACT.
CONCLUSIONS: Trained and supervised ADDO dispensers in rural Tanzania performed
and sold RDTs under real market conditions to two-thirds of suspected malaria
patients during this one-year pilot. These results support the hypothesis that
introducing RDTs into regulated private retail sector settings can improve
malaria testing and treatment practices without an RDT subsidy. Trial

BACKGROUND: Despite progress made in the last decades, malaria persists as a
pressing health issue in sub-Saharan Africa. Pregnant women are particularly
vulnerable to infection and serious health outcomes for themselves and their
unborn child. Risk can be mitigated through appropriate use of control measures
such as insecticide-treated bed nets. Although social networks can influence
uptake of preventive strategies, the role of social influence on bed net
ownership has not been explored. During an evaluation of a bed net distribution
programme, the influence of non-health care advisors on ownership and use of bed 
nets by pregnant women in Kumasi, Ghana was examined.
METHODS: Data were collected through in-person interviews with 300 pregnant women
seeking antenatal care in an urban hospital in Kumasi, Ghana. Participants were
asked about their bed net ownership, bed net use, and information about three
personal contacts that they go to for pregnancy advice. Information about these
advisors was combined into an influence score. Logistic regression models were
used to determine the association between the score and bed net ownership. Those 
who owned a bed net were further assessed to determine if interpersonal influence
was associated with self-reported sleeping under the bed net the previous night.
RESULTS: Of the 294 women in the analysis, 229 (78%) reported owning bed nets. Of
these bed net owners, 139 (61%) reported using a bed net the previous night. A
dose response relationship was observed between the interpersonal influence score
and bed net ownership and use. Compared to the lowest influence score, those with
the highest influence score (>1 SD above the mean) were marginally more likely to
own a bed net [OR = 2.37, 95% CI (0.87, 6.39)] and much more likely to use their 
bed net [5.38, 95% CI (1.89, 15.25)] after adjusting for other factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Interpersonal influence appears to have modest impact on ownership
and use of bed nets by pregnant women in an urban area of Ghana. Further
investigations would need to be conducted to determine if the relationship is
causal or if individuals who associate are simply more likely to have similar
practices.

BACKGROUND: In 2010, the World Health Organization issued a guideline that calls 
for a shift from presumptive to test-based treatment. However, test-based
treatment is still unpopular in community pharmacies. This could be due to
unwillingness of customers to spend extra finance on rapid diagnostic test (RDT).
It could also result from lack of interest from community pharmacists since they 
may perceive no financial gain attached to this service. This study assessed the 
cost-benefit of test-based malaria treatment to community pharmacists.
METHODS: The study was a community pharmacy-based cross sectional survey.
Potential benefit of RDT was determined using customers' willingness-to-pay (WTP)
for service. Average WTP was estimated using contingent valuation. Binary
logistic regression was used to assess correlates of WTP acceptance while
multiple linear regression was used to model the relationship between the
independent variables and WTP amount. Cost associated with provision of RDT was
estimated from provider's perspective. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was
used to capture parameter uncertainty. Benefit-cost ratio (BCR) was calculated to
determine study objective.
RESULTS: A total of 135 out of 235 participants (57.4%) responded to the WTP
question. Of this subset, 111 participants (82.2%) preferred RDT before malaria
treatment. Average WTP [minimum-maximum] was US$1.23 [US$0.0-US$5.03]. Educated
participants had 1.8 times higher odds of WTP for RDT. Participants that
understood RDT as described in the questionnaire had 18.3 times higher odds of
WTP for RDT compared to participants that did not understand RDT as described in 
the questionnaire. Additionally, a unit increase in level of education (e.g. from
primary to secondary school) led to US$0.298 increase in WTP amount for RDT.
Also, a unit increase in malaria frequency (e.g. from 'never' to 'rarely') led to
US$0.293 decrease in WTP amount for RDT. Average cost [minimum-maximum] of RDT
test kit and pharmacist time spent in administering the test were US$0.15
[US$0.13-US$0.17] and US$0.41 [US$0.18-US$0.52], respectively. BCR of test-based 
malaria treatment was 6.7 (95% CI 6.4-7.0).
CONCLUSION: Test-based malaria treatment is cost-beneficial for pharmacy
practitioners. This finding could be used as an advocacy tool to increase
community pharmacists' interest and uptake of test-based malaria treatment.

BACKGROUND: The clinical and virologic characteristics of Ebola virus disease
(EVD) in children have not been thoroughly documented.
METHODS: Consecutive children aged <18 years with real-time polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed EVD were enrolled retrospectively in 5 Ebola
treatment units in Liberia and Sierra Leone in 2014/2015. Data collection and
medical management were based on standardized International Medical Corps
protocols. We performed descriptive statistics, multivariate logistic regression,
and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses.
RESULTS: Of 122 children enrolled, the median age was 7 years and one-third were 
aged <5 years. The female-to-male ratio was 1.3. The most common clinical
features at triage and during hospitalization were fever, weakness, anorexia, and
diarrhea, although 21% of patients were initially afebrile and 6 patients
remained afebrile. Bleeding was rare at presentation (5%) and manifested
subsequently in fewer than 50%. The overall case fatality rate was 57%. Factors
associated with death in bivariate analyses were age <5 years, bleeding at any
time during hospitalization, and high viral load. After adjustment with logistic 
regression modeling, the odds of death were 14.8-fold higher if patients were
aged <5 years, 5-fold higher if the patient had any evidence of bleeding, and
5.2-fold higher if EVD RT-PCR cycle threshold value was ≤20. Plasmodium
parasitemia had no impact on EVD outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Age <5 years, bleeding, and high viral loads were poor prognostic
indicators of children with EVD. Research to understand mechanisms of these risk 
factors and the impact of dehydration and electrolyte imbalance will improve
health outcomes.

An estimated 40 million women of childbearing age suffer from schistosomiasis.
Animal models indicate a deleterious effect of maternal schistosomiasis on
pregnancy outcomes. To date there is a lack of epidemiological evidence
evaluating schistosomiasis-related morbidity in pregnancy. This study was
designed to describe the impact of urogenital schistosomiasis on pregnancy
outcomes in a highly endemic region of central Africa. Pregnant women attending
antenatal clinics in Fougamou and Lambaréné, Gabon, were consecutively screened
for the presence of Schistosoma haematobium eggs in diurnal urine samples.
Maternal and newborn characteristics assessed at delivery were compared between
infected and uninfected mothers. The impact of maternal schistosomiasis on low
birth weight and preterm delivery was assessed using logistic regression
analysis. Urogenital schistosomiasis was diagnosed in 103 (9%) of 1115 pregnant
women. Maternal age was inversely associated with the prevalence of urogenital
schistosomiasis, with a higher burden amongst nulliparous women. Low birth weight
was more common amongst infants of S. haematobium-infected mothers. This
association was unaffected by controlling for demographic characteristics,
gestational age and Plasmodium infection status (adjusted Odds Ratio 1.93; 95%
confidence interval: 1.08-3.42). Other risk factors associated with low birth
weight delivery were underweight mothers (adjusted Odds Ratio 2.34; 95%
confidence interval: 1.12-4.92), peripheral or placental Plasmodium falciparum
infection (adjusted Odds Ratio 2.04; 95% confidence interval: 1.18-3.53) and
preterm birth (adjusted Odds Ratio 3.12; 95% confidence interval: 1.97-4.96).
Preterm delivery was not associated with S. haematobium infection (adjusted Odds 
Ratio 1.07 95% confidence interval: 0.57-1.98). In conclusion, this study
indicates that pregnant women with urogenital schistosomiasis are at an increased
risk for low birth weight deliveries. Further studies evaluating targeted
treatment and prevention programmes for urogenital schistosomiasis in pregnant
women and their impact on delivery outcomes are warranted.

BACKGROUND: In Madagascar, the last study on sickle cell disease (SCD) was done
in the early 1980s. The country is known as endemic for malaria and respiratory
infections. The main objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of
SCD; the secondary objective was to evaluate its association with malaria and
respiratory infections.
METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study which was carried out in a rural village
in the south east coast of Madagascar between May 2011 and November 2013.
Participants were children aged between 2-59 months presenting with fever
measured by axillary temperature ≥37.5 °C at inclusion. Genotyping of haemoglobin
S was done by PCR and malaria was diagnosed by Rapid Diagnostic Test. Research
for viral and atypical bacterial respiratory pathogens was performed on
nasopharyngeal swabs. Uni-and multivariate polytomous logistic regression was
done to assess associations between microbiological results and SCD status, with 
HbAA phenotype as reference.
RESULTS: A total of 807 children were analysed. Prevalence of SCD among febrile
children was 2.4% (95% CI, 1.5-3.7%) and that of SCT was 23.8% (95% CI,
20.9-26.9%). There was no difference in the prevalence of malaria infection
according to haemoglobin status (p = 0.3). Rhinovirus (22.5%), adenovirus
(14.1%), and bocavirus (11.6%) were the most common respiratory pathogens
detected. After univariate analysis, patients with SCD were more frequently
infected by parechovirus (p = 0.01), while patients with SCT were more prone to
RSV A or B infection (p = 0.01). After multivariate analysis, HbAS phenotype was 
associated with higher risk of RSV A and B infection compared to HbAA (adjusted
OR = 1.9; 95% CI: 1.2-3.1, p = 0.009), while HbSS phenotype was associated with
higher risk of parechovirus infection (adjusted OR = 6.0; 95% CI: 1.1-31.3,
p = 0.03) compared to HbAA, independently of age, gender, period per quarter, and
the other viruses.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of SCD among under-five children presenting with fever
was high in the study population. No association was found between SCT and
malaria but few viruses, especially parechovirus, seem to play an important role 
in the occurrence of pneumoniae among SCD patients.

The aim of this study was to identify the risk factors associated with low birth 
weight (LBW) in the city of Lubumbashi (DR Congo). This case-control study of
singleton births took place from July to December 2014 in 3 referral maternity
units in Lubumbashi. The mothers' social and demographic characteristics and
medical and obstetric history, especially during this pregnancy, as well as the
newborns' sex were compared between the case group (< 2500 g) and the control
group. The usual statistics and logistic regression were used to analyze the
results. The significance level was set at P < 0.05. We observed that a low
educational level (OR adjusted = 2.5 [1.5-4.0]), employment (OR adjusted = 2.0
[1.3-3.1]), lack of prenatal care (OR adjusted = 2.5 [1.5-4.2]), maternal anemia 
(OR adjusted = 7.6 [2.3-24.8]), malaria during the pregnancy (OR adjusted = 1.5
[1.0-2.3]), urogenital infections during pregnancy (OR adjusted = 1.6 [1.1-2.5]),
gestational hypertension (OR adjusted = 2.7 [1.5-4.9]), and maternal malnutrition
(OR adjusted = 8.3 [2.4-28.5]) were all significantly associated with LBW. This
study shows that some maternal demographic, medical, and obstetric factors
influence the birth of LBW infants. Because some of these factors can be
addressed and treated, the reduction of neonatal morbidity and mortality
associated with LBW requires improving the health care system in our city,
including its accessibility.

There is need to understand how various malaria risk factors interact at the
individual, household and community levels, as well as wider contexts, in order
to guide the design and implementation of effective and more comprehensive
control strategies. Using a cross-sectional approach, this study investigated
various malaria risk factors among residents of Mgedula Village, a
malaria-endemic community located in Jozini Local Municipality, UMkhanyakude
District, South Africa from May to August 2014. Data from 121 randomly sampled
women were collected using close-ended questionnaires. The women were aged
between 18 and 40 years; and had been residents in the study area for five years 
or more. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to measure the
association between a history of malaria infection in the previous 12 months and 
various potential risk factors. The results showed that practicing animal
husbandry (OR 20), residing in household structures that had not been sprayed (OR
16.7) and cross-border movement (OR 14.3) were greatly associated with malaria
infection. Other factors that were significantly associated with this infection
included illiteracy (OR 9.1), having a largely populated household (OR 6.1) and
low income (OR 1.65). Individuals with a history of malaria infection were less
likely to lack basic malaria-related knowledge (OR 0.58), to have negative
attitude towards malaria (OR 0.29) and also to have poor malaria practices (OR
0.3). There was no association between a malaria episode and residing at a long
distance from the health facility. Indoor residual spraying indicated a notable
reduction of malaria risk at the community level. However, other socio-economic, 
geographical and socio-demographic factors interacted at different levels to
increase this risk among different individuals and households. To achieve malaria
elimination by the year 2018, these aspects should be considered when developing 
and implementing elimination strategies at the individual, household and
community levels, among high-risk populations.

BACKGROUND: Fever is common among patients seeking care in sub-Saharan Africa
(sSA), but causes other than malaria are rarely diagnosed. We assessed dengue and
chikungunya virus infections among young febrile adults evaluated for acute HIV
infection (AHI) and malaria in coastal Kenya.
METHODS: We tested plasma samples obtained in a cross-sectional study from
febrile adult patients aged 18-35 years evaluated for AHI and malaria at urgent
care seeking at seven health facilities in coastal Kenya in 2014-2015. Dengue
virus (DENV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) were amplified using quantitative
real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. We conducted logistic 
regression analyses to determine independent predictors of dengue virus
infection.
RESULTS: 489 samples that were negative for both AHI and malaria were tested, of 
which 43 (8.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.4-11.7) were positive for DENV
infection. No participant was positive for CHIKV infection. DENV infections were 
associated with clinic visits in the rainy season (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) =
3.0, 95% CI: 1.3-6.5) and evaluation at a private health facility (AOR 5.2, 95%
CI: 2.0-13.1) or research health facility (AOR = 25.6, 95% CI: 8.9-73.2) instead 
of a public health facility.
CONCLUSION: A high prevalence of DENV infections was found in febrile young adult
patients evaluated for AHI. Our data suggests that DENV, along with AHI and
malaria, should be considered in the differential diagnosis of the adult patient 
seeking care for fever in coastal Kenya.

BACKGROUND: Malaria burden in Brazil has reached its lowest levels in 35 years
and Plasmodium vivax now accounts for 84% of cases countrywide. Targeting
residual malaria transmission entrenched in the Amazon is the next major
challenge for ongoing elimination efforts. Better strategies are urgently needed 
to address the vast reservoir of asymptomatic P. vivax carriers in this and other
areas approaching malaria elimination.
METHODS: We evaluated a reactive case detection (RCD) strategy tailored for P.
vivax transmission in farming settlements in the Amazon Basin of Brazil. Over six
months, 41 cases detected by passive surveillance triggered four rounds of RCD
(0, 30, 60, and 180 days after index case enrollment), using microscopy- and
quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)-based diagnosis,
comprising subjects sharing the household (HH) with the index case (n = 163),
those living in the 5 nearest HHs within 3 km (n = 878), and individuals from 5
randomly chosen control HHs located > 5 km away from index cases (n = 841).
Correlates of infection were identified with mixed-effects logistic regression
models. Molecular genotyping was used to infer local parasite transmission
networks.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS/CONCLUSIONS: Subjects in index and neighbor HHs were
significantly more likely to be parasitemic than control HH members, after
adjusting for potential confounders, and together harbored > 90% of the P. vivax 
biomass in study subjects. Clustering patterns were temporally stable. Four
rounds of microscopy-based RCD would identify only 49.5% of the infections
diagnosed by qPCR, but 76.8% of the total parasite biomass circulating in the
proximity of index HHs. However, control HHs accounted for 27.6% of qPCR-positive
samples, 92.6% of them from asymptomatic carriers beyond the reach of RCD.
Molecular genotyping revealed high P. vivax diversity, consistent with complex
transmission networks and multiple sources of infection within clusters,
potentially complicating malaria elimination efforts.

BACKGROUND:  If malaria patients who cannot be treated orally are several hours
from facilities for injections, rectal artesunate prior to hospital referral can 
prevent death and disability. The goal is to reduce death from malaria by having 
rectal artesunate treatment available and used. How best to do this remains
unknown.
METHODS:  Villages remote from a health facility were randomized to different
community-based treatment providers trained to provide rectal artesunate in
Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Tanzania, and Uganda. Prereferral rectal artesunate
treatment was provided in 272 villages: 109 through community-based health
workers (CHWs), 112 via trained mothers (MUMs), 25 via trained traditional
healers (THs), and 26 through trained community-chosen personnel (COMs); episodes
eligible for rectal artesunate were established through regular household surveys
of febrile illnesses recording symptoms eligible for prereferral treatment.
Differences in treatment coverage with rectal artesunate in children aged <5
years in MUM vs CHW (standard-of-care) villages were assessed using the odds
ratio (OR); the predictive probability of treatment was derived from a logistic
regression analysis, adjusting for heterogeneity between clusters (villages)
using random effects.
RESULTS:  Over 19 months, 54 013 children had 102 504 febrile episodes, of which 
32% (31 817 episodes) had symptoms eligible for prereferral therapy; 14% (4460)
children received treatment. Episodes with altered consciousness, coma, or
convulsions constituted 36.6% of all episodes in treated children. The overall OR
of treatment between MUM vs CHW villages, adjusting for country, was 1.84 (95%
confidence interval [CI], 1.20-2.83; P = .005). Adjusting for heterogeneity, this
translated into a 1.67 higher average probability of a child being treated in MUM
vs CHW villages. Referral compliance was 81% and significantly higher with CHWs
vs MUMs: 87% vs 82% (risk ratio [RR], 1.1 [95% CI, 1.0-1.1]; P < .0001). There
were more deaths in the TH cluster than elsewhere (RR, 2.7 [95% CI, 1.4-5.6]; P =
.0040).
CONCLUSIONS:  Prereferral episodes were almost one-third of all febrile episodes.
More than one-third of patients treated had convulsions, altered consciousness,
or coma. Mothers were effective in treating patients, and achieved higher
coverage than other providers. Treatment access was low.

BACKGROUND: Insecticide-treated bednets (ITNs) are effective in preventing
malaria where vectors primarily bite indoors and late at night, but their
effectiveness is uncertain where vectors bite outdoors and earlier in the
evening. We studied the effectiveness of ITNs following a mass distribution in
Haiti from May to September, 2012, where the Anopheles albimanus vector bites
primarily outdoors and often when people are awake.
METHODS: In this case-control study, we enrolled febrile patients presenting to
outpatient departments at 17 health facilities throughout Haiti from Sept 4,
2012, to Feb 27, 2014, who were tested with malaria rapid diagnostic tests
(RDTs), and administered questionnaires on ITN use and other risk factors. Cases 
were defined by positive RDT and controls were febrile patients from the same
clinic with a negative RDT. Our primary analysis retrospectively matched cases
and controls by age, sex, location, and date, and used conditional logistic
regression on the matched sample. A sensitivity analysis used propensity scores
to match patients on ITN use propensity and analyse malaria among ITN users and
non-users. Additional ITN bioefficacy and entomological data were collected.
FINDINGS: We enrolled 9317 patients, including 378 (4%) RDT-positive cases. 1202 
(13%) patients reported ITN use. Post-hoc matching of cases and controls yielded 
362 cases and 1201 matched controls, 19% (333) of whom reported consistent
campaign net use. After using propensity scores to match on consistent campaign
ITN use, 2298 patients, including 138 (7%) RDT-positive cases, were included:
1149 consistent campaign ITN users and 1149 non-consistent campaign ITN users.
Both analyses revealed that ITNs did not significantly protect against clinical
malaria (odds ratio [OR]=0·95, 95% CI 0·68-1·32, p=0·745 for case-control
analysis; OR=0·95, 95% CI 0·45-1·97, p=0·884 for propensity score analysis). ITN 
and entomological data indicated good ITN physical integrity and bioefficacy, and
no permethrin resistance among local mosquitoes.
INTERPRETATION: We found no evidence that mass ITN campaigns reduce clinical
malaria in this observational study in Haiti; alternative malaria control
strategies should be prioritised.

BACKGROUND: Community health workers (CHWs) have the potential to reduce child
mortality by improving access to care, especially in remote areas. Uganda has one
of the highest child mortality rates globally. Moreover, rural areas bear the
highest proportion of this burden. The optimal performance of CHWs is critical.
In this study, we assess the performance of CHWs in managing malaria, pneumonia, 
and diarrhea in the rural district of Lira, in northern Uganda.
DESIGNS: A cross-sectional mixed methods study was undertaken to investigate the 
performance of 393 eligible CHWs in the Lira district of Uganda. Case scenarios
were conducted with a medical officer observing CHWs in their management of
children suspected of having malaria, pneumonia, or diarrhea. Performance data
were collected using a pretested questionnaire with a checklist used by the
medical officer to score the CHWs. The primary outcome, CHW performance, is
defined as the ability to diagnose and treat malaria, diarrhea, and pneumonia
appropriately. Participants were described using a three group performance score 
(good vs. moderate vs. poor). A binary measure of performance (good vs. poor) was
used in multivariable logistic regression to show an association between good
performance and a range of independent variables. The qualitative component
comprised seven key informant interviews with experts who had informed knowledge 
with regard to the functionality of CHWs in Lira district.
RESULTS: Overall, 347 CHWs (88.3%) had poor scores in managing malaria, diarrhea,
and pneumonia, 26 (6.6%) had moderate scores, and 20 (5.1%) had good scores. The 
factors that were positively associated with performance were secondary-level
education (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.72; 95% confidence interval [CI]
1.50-4.92) and meeting with supervisors in the previous month (AOR 2.52; 95% CI
1.12-5.70). Those factors negatively associated with CHW performance included:
serving 100-200 households (AOR 0.24; 95% CI 0.12-0.50), serving more than 200
households (AOR 0.22; 95% CI 0.10-0.48), and an initial training duration lasting
2-3 days (AOR 0.13; 95% CI 0.04-0.41). The qualitative findings reinforced the
quantitative results by indicating that refresher training, workload, and in-kind
incentives were important determinants of performance.
CONCLUSIONS: The performance of CHWs in Lira was inadequate. There is a need to
consider pre-qualification testing before CHWs are appointed. Providing ongoing
support and supervision, and ensuring that CHWs have at least secondary education
can be helpful in improving their performance. Health system managers also need
to ensure that the CHWs' workload is moderated as work overload will reduce
performance. Finally, although short training programs are beneficial to some
degree, they are not sufficient and should be followed up with regular refresher 
training.

BACKGROUND: Many malaria-endemic countries have implemented national community
health worker (CHW) programmes to serve remote populations that have poor access 
to malaria diagnosis and treatment. Despite mounting evidence of CHWs' ability to
adhere to malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and treatment guidelines, there
is limited evidence whether CHWs adhere to the referral guidelines and refer
severely ill children for further management. In southwest Uganda, this study
examined whether CHWs referred children according to training guidelines and
described factors associated with adherence to the referral guideline.
METHODS: A secondary analysis was undertaken of data collected during two
cluster-randomized trials conducted between January 2010 and July 2011, one in a 
moderate-to-high malaria transmission setting and the other in a low malaria
transmission setting. All CHWs were trained to prescribe artemisinin-based
combination therapy (ACT) and recognize symptoms in children that required
immediate referral to the nearest health centre. Intervention arm CHWs had
additional training on how to conduct an RDT; CHWs in the control arm used a
presumptive diagnosis for malaria using clinical signs and symptoms. CHW
treatment registers were reviewed to identify children eligible for referral
according to training guidelines (temperature of ≥38.5 °C), to assess whether
CHWs adhered to the guidelines and referred them. Factors associated with
adherence were examined with logistic regression models.
RESULTS: CHWs failed to refer 58.8% of children eligible in the moderate-to-high 
transmission and 31.2% of children in the low transmission setting. CHWs using
RDTs adhered to the referral guidelines more frequently than CHWs not using RDTs 
(moderate-to-high transmission: 50.1 vs 18.0%, p = 0.003; low transmission: 88.5 
vs 44.1%, p < 0.001). In both settings, fewer than 20% of eligible children
received pre-referral treatment with rectal artesunate. Children who were
prescribed ACT were very unlikely to be referred in both settings (97.7 and 73.3%
were not referred in the moderate-to-high and low transmission settings,
respectively). In the moderate-to-high transmission setting, day and season of
visit were also associated with the likelihood of adherence to the referral
guidelines, but not in the low transmission setting.
CONCLUSIONS: CHW adherence to referral guidelines was poor in both transmission
settings. However, training CHWs to use RDT improved correct referral of children
with a high fever compared to a presumptive diagnosis using sign and symptoms. As
many countries scale up CHW programmes, routine monitoring of reported data
should be examined carefully to assess whether CHWs adhere to referral guidelines
and take remedial actions where required.

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency has been associated with a
lower cancer risk, possibly via a reduction of mutagenic oxygen-free radicals and
by reducing nicotinamide-adeninedinucleotide-phosphate for replicating cells. In 
Sardinia, the enzyme defect is frequent as a consequence of selection by malaria 
in the past. This study investigated the relationship between G6PD deficiency and
colorectal cancer (CRC).A retrospective case-control study of 3901 patients from 
Sardinia, who underwent a colonoscopy between 2006 and 2016, was performed. G6PD 
phenotype was assessed for each subject. The proportion of pre and malignant
colorectal lesions was compared in cases (G6PD-deficient) and controls
(G6PD-normal). Data concerning age, sex, family history of CRC, smoking habits,
body height, and weight, and also associated diseases were collected.The CRC risk
reduction was 43.2% among G6PD-deficient compared with G6PD-normal subjects (odds
ratio 0.57, 95% confidence interval 0.37-0.87, P = 0.010). Age, sex, family
history of CRC, and also comorbidities such as type 1 diabetes and ischemic heart
disease, were significantly associated with CRC risk. The protective effect of
G6PD deficiency remained significant after adjusting for all covariates by
logistic regression analysis, and was consistently lower across all age
groups.Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase enzyme deficiency is associated with a
reduced risk of CRC.

BACKGROUND: Human brucellosis remains to be a neglected zoonotic disease among
agro-pastoral communities where livestock rearing is one of the main economic
activities. This study was conducted in different agro-pastoral communities in
Sengerema district, Mwanza, Tanzania, to determine seroprevalence and predictors 
of anti-Brucella antibodies, information that may influence public awareness on
the risk factors and strategies to improve the diagnosis of brucellosis in
developing countries.
METHODS: A cross-sectional community-based study was conducted between July and
September 2008 in ten villages of Sengerema district. Sociodemographic and other 
related information were collected using a standardized data collection tool.
Detection of Brucella abortus and Brucella melitensis antibodies were done using 
rapid Brucella serum agglutination test. Data were analysed by using STATA
version 11.0. Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) were calculated using multivariate
logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 382 adults were enrolled with the median age of 30
(interquartile range 15-40) years. Males formed the majority of the participants 
234 (61.5 %). Overall, seroprevalence of anti-Brucella antibodies was found to be
14.1 % (54/382, 95 % CI 10.6-17.5). Seroprevalence of B. melitensis was 11 %
(42/382) while that of B. abortus was found to be 7 % (26/282), P = 0.0267.
Co-infection of B. melitensis and B. abortus was observed in 3.6 % (14/382, 95 % 
CI 1.7-5.4) of participants. On a multivariate logistic regression analysis, male
sex (AOR 3.2, 95 % CI 1.3-7.5, P = 0.007), touching goat placenta (AOR 2.54, 95 %
CI 1.05-6.14, P = 0.012) and agro-pastoralist occupation (AOR 2.07, 95 % CI
1.01-4.24, P = 0.04) were found to predict B. melitensis infection. Males (AOR
3.07, 95 % CI 1.45-6.51, P = 0.003) and agro-pastoralists (AOR 2.98, 95 % CI
1.38-6.43, P = 0.005) were found to be predictors for specific anti-Brucella
antibodies.
CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion of the agro-pastoralist male population in 
agro-pastoral communities in Sengerema district is positive for anti-Brucella
antibodies. With the decrease incidence of malaria fever, other causes of fever
such as Brucella spp. should be considered of public health concern in Tanzania
especially in agro-pastoral communities.

BACKGROUND: Despite recent progress, pneumonia remains the largest infectious
killer of children globally. This paper describes outcomes of not treating
community-diagnosed fast-breathing pneumonia on patient recovery.
METHODS: We conducted an exploratory subanalysis of an observational prospective 
cohort study in Malawi. We recruited children (2-59 months) diagnosed by
community health workers with fast-breathing pneumonia using WHO integrated
community case management (iCCM) guidelines. Children were followed at days 5 and
14 with a clinical assessment of recovery. We conducted bivariate and
multivariable logistic regression for the association between treatment of
fast-breathing pneumonia and recovery, adjusting for potential confounders.
RESULTS: We followed up 847 children, of whom 78 (9%) had not been given
antibiotics (non-treatment). Non-treatment cases had higher baseline rates of
diarrhoea, non-severe hypoxaemia and fever. Non-recovery (persistence or
worsening of symptoms) was 13% and 23% at day 5 in those who did receive and
those who did not receive co-trimoxazole. Non-recovery, when defined as worsening
of symptoms only, at day 5 was 7% in treatment and 10% in non-treatment cases.
For both definitions, combined co-trimoxazole and lumefantrine-artemether (LA)
treatment trended towards protection (adjusted OR (aOR) 0.28; 95% CI 0.12 to
0.68/aOR 0.29; 95% CI 0.08 to 1.01).
CONCLUSION: We found that children who did not receive co-trimoxazole treatment
had worse clinical outcomes; malaria co-diagnosis and treatment also play a
significant role in non-recovery. Further research into non-treatment of
fast-breathing pneumonia, using a pragmatic approach with consideration for
malaria co-diagnosis and HIV status is needed to guide refinement of community
treatment algorithms in this region.

BACKGROUND: Antigenic polymorphisms are considered as one of the main strategies 
employed by malaria parasites to escape from the host immune responses after
infections. Merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP-1) of Plasmodium vivax, a promising 
vaccine candidate, is a highly polymorphic protein whose immune recognition is
not well understood.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The IgG responses to conserved (MSP-119) and polymorphic
(block 2 and block 10) epitopes of PvMSP-1 were evaluated in 141 P. vivax
infected patients. Ten recombinant proteins corresponding to block 2 (variants
BR07, BP29, BP39, BP30, BEL) and block 10 (BR07, BP29, BP39, BP01, BP13) often
observed in Brazilian P. vivax isolates were assessed by ELISA in order to
determine levels of specific antibodies and their respective seroprevalence. The 
magnitude and the frequency of variant-specific responses were very low, except
for BR07 variant (>40%), which was the predominant haplotype as revealed by block
10 PvMSP-1 gene sequencing. By contrast, 89% of patients had IgG against the
C-terminal conserved domain (PvMSP-119), confirming the high antigenicity of this
protein. Using multiple linear and logistic regression models, there was evidence
for a negative association between levels of haemoglobin and several IgG
antibodies against block 2 variant antigens, with the strongest association being
observed for BP39 allelic version. This variant was also found to increase the
odds of anaemia in these patients.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings may have implications for vaccine development and
represent an important step towards a better understanding of the polymorphic
PvMSP-1 domain as potential targets of vaccine development. These data highlight 
the importance of extending the study of these polymorphic epitopes of PvMSP-1 to
different epidemiological settings.

Malaria-endemic countries have implemented community health worker (CHW) programs
to provide malaria diagnosis and treatment to populations living beyond the reach
of health systems. However, there is limited evidence describing the referral
practices of CHWs. We examined the impact of malaria rapid diagnostic tests
(mRDTs) on CHW referral in two cluster-randomized trials, one conducted in a
moderate-to-high malaria transmission setting and one in a low-transmission
setting in Uganda, between January 2010 and July 2012. All CHWs were trained to
prescribe artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) for malaria and recognize
signs and symptoms for referral to health centers. CHWs in the control arm used a
presumptive diagnosis for malaria based on clinical symptoms, whereas
intervention arm CHWs used mRDTs. CHWs recorded ACT prescriptions, mRDT results, 
and referral in patient registers. An intention-to-treat analysis was undertaken 
using multivariable logistic regression. Referral was more frequent in the
intervention arm versus the control arm (moderate-to-high transmission, P <
0.001; low transmission, P < 0.001). Despite this increase, referral advice was
not always given when ACTs or prereferral rectal artesunate were prescribed: 14% 
prescribed rectal artesunate in the moderate-to-high setting were not referred.
In addition, CHWs considered factors alongside mRDTs when referring. Child visits
during the weekends or the rainy season were less likely to be referred, whereas 
visits to CHWs more distant from health centers were more likely to be referred
(low transmission only). CHWs using mRDTs and ACTs increased referral compared
with CHWs using a presumptive diagnosis. To address these concerns, referral
training should be emphasized in CHW programs as they are scaled-up.

Experimental work increasingly suggests that non-random pathogen associations can
affect the spread or severity of disease. Yet due to difficulties distinguishing 
and interpreting co-infections, evidence for the presence and directionality of
pathogen co-occurrences in wildlife is rudimentary. We provide empirical evidence
for pathogen co-occurrences by analysing infection matrices for avian malaria
(Haemoproteus and Plasmodium spp.) and parasitic filarial nematodes
(microfilariae) in wild birds (New Caledonian Zosterops spp.). Using visual and
genus-specific molecular parasite screening, we identified high levels of
co-infections that would have been missed using PCR alone. Avian malaria lineages
were assigned to species level using morphological descriptions. We estimated
parasite co-occurrence probabilities, while accounting for environmental
predictors, in a hierarchical multivariate logistic regression. Co-infections
occurred in 36% of infected birds. We identified both positively and negatively
correlated parasite co-occurrence probabilities when accounting for host, habitat
and island effects. Two of three pairwise avian malaria co-occurrences were
strongly negative, despite each malaria parasite occurring across all islands and
habitats. Birds with microfilariae had elevated heterophil to lymphocyte ratios
and were all co-infected with avian malaria, consistent with evidence that host
immune modulation by parasitic nematodes facilitates malaria co-infections.
Importantly, co-occurrence patterns with microfilariae varied in direction among 
avian malaria species; two malaria parasites correlated positively but a third
correlated negatively with microfilariae. We show that wildlife co-infections are
frequent, possibly affecting infection rates through competition or facilitation.
We argue that combining multiple diagnostic screening methods with multivariate
logistic regression offers a platform to disentangle impacts of environmental
factors and parasite co-occurrences on wildlife disease.

BACKGROUND: Malaria transmission is highly heterogeneous, especially in low
endemic countries, such as Cambodia. This results in geographical clusters of
residual transmission in the dry, low transmission season, which can fuel the
transmission to wider areas or populations during the wet season. A better
understanding of spatial clustering of malaria can lead to a more efficient,
targeted strategy to reduce malaria transmission. This study aims to evaluate the
potential of the use of serological markers to define spatial patterns in malaria
exposure.
METHODS: Blood samples collected in a community-based randomized trial performed 
in 98 high endemic communities in Ratanakiri province, north-eastern Cambodia,
were screened with a multiplex serological assay for five serological markers
(three Plasmodium falciparum and two Plasmodium vivax). The antibody half-lives
range from approximately six months until more than two years. Geographical
heterogeneity in malaria transmission was examined using a spatial scan statistic
on serology, PCR prevalence and malaria incidence rate data. Furthermore, to
identify behavioural patterns or intrinsic factors associated with malaria
exposure (antibody levels), risk factor analyses were performed by using
multivariable random effect logistic regression models. The serological outcomes 
were then compared to PCR prevalence and malaria incidence data.
RESULTS: A total of 6502 samples from two surveys were screened in an area where 
the average parasite prevalence estimated by PCR among the selected villages is
3.4 %. High-risk malaria pockets were observed adjacent to the 'Tonle San River' 
and neighbouring Vietnam for all three sets of data (serology, PCR prevalence and
malaria incidence rates). The main risk factors for all P. falciparum antigens
and P. vivax MSP1.19 are age, ethnicity and staying overnight at the plot hut.
CONCLUSION: It is possible to identify similar malaria pockets of higher malaria 
transmission together with the potential risk factors by using serology instead
of PCR prevalence or malaria incidence data. In north-eastern Cambodia, the
serological markers show that malaria transmission occurs mainly in adults
staying overnight in plot huts in the field. Pf.GLURP.R2 showed a shrinking
pocket of malaria transmission over time, and Pf.MSP1.19, CSP, PvAMA1 were also
informative for current infection to a lesser extent. Therefore, serology could
contribute in future research. However, further in-depth research in selecting
the best combination of antigens is required.

BACKGROUND: In the Lao PDR, malaria morbidity and mortality have remarkably
decreased over the past decade. However, asymptomatic infections in rural
villages contribute to the on-going local transmission. The primary objective of 
this study was to explore the characteristics of infections in a malaria-endemic 
district of the Lao PDR. The specific objectives were to investigate the
prevalence and species of malaria parasites using molecular methods and to assess
individual and household parasite levels and the characteristics associated with 
malaria infection.
METHODS: The study population included 870 participants from 236 households in 10
villages of the Xepon district. Interviews, blood examinations and body
temperature measurements were conducted between August and September 2013. A
multilevel logistic regression model, with adjustment for clustering effects, was
used to assess the association between predictor variables and an outcome
variable (malaria infection status as principally determined by PCR). The
predictive factors included individual-level factors (age, gender, past fever
episode, and forest activity during night time) and household-level factors
(household member size, household bed net usage/density and a household with one 
other malaria-infected member).
RESULTS: Fifty-two participants (including 26 children) tested positive (positive
rate: 6.0 %): Plasmodium falciparum mono-infection was the most common infection 
(n = 41, 78.8 %), followed by P. falciparum and Plasmodium vivax mixed infections
(n = 9, 17.3 %). The majority of infected participants (n = 42, 80.8 %) had no
fever episodes in the two previous weeks or a measurable fever (>37 °C) at the
time of survey. Living in a household with one other malaria-infected member
significantly increased the odds of infection (odds ratio 24.33, 95 % confidence 
interval 10.15-58.32). Among the 40 households that had at least one infected
member, nine households were responsible for 40.4 % of the total infections.
CONCLUSIONS: Plasmodium vivax was detected more frequently than it was reported
from the district hospital. Most infections were asymptomatic and sub-microscopic
and were highly clustered within households. To further eliminate malaria in
Xepon and other similar settings in the country, the National Malaria Control
Programme should consider household-based strategies, including reactive case
detection targeting the household members of index cases.

For most of the time, biomedical researchers have been dealing with ordinal
outcome variable in multilevel models where patients are nested in doctors. We
can justifiably apply multilevel cumulative logit model, where the outcome
variable represents the mild, severe, and extremely severe intensity of diseases 
like malaria and typhoid in the form of ordered categories. Based on our
simulation conditions, Maximum Likelihood (ML) method is better than Penalized
Quasilikelihood (PQL) method in three-category ordinal outcome variable. PQL
method, however, performs equally well as ML method where five-category ordinal
outcome variable is used. Further, to achieve power more than 0.80, at least 50
groups are required for both ML and PQL methods of estimation. It may be pointed 
out that, for five-category ordinal response variable model, the power of PQL
method is slightly higher than the power of ML method.

Impact of insecticide-treated bednet use on malaria prevalence in
Benishangul-Gumuz regional state, Ethiopia.

Wale M(1), Mindaye A(1).

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biology, Bahir Dar University, Ethiopia.

BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: In Ethiopia, nearly 10 million insecticide-treated
bednets (ITNs) were distributed between 2004 and 2005; which touched 56 million
in 2012. The study was aimed to determine the impact of these bednets on malaria 
prevalence, in Yaso district of Benishangul-Gumuz region, western Ethiopia.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted during the peak malaria
transmission season (October-November, 2014) in the Yaso district,
Benishangul-Gumuz region. Data on demographic variables, ITN ownership and
malaria infection rates were collected using structured questionnaires and blood 
film tests and analyzed using SAS for windows software. The probability of
getting infected (questionnaire and the blood film results) was regressed against
groups of explanatory variables, like age, sex, bednet use etc. using multiple
logistic regressions.
RESULTS: The results revealed that about 40% of the study subjects (384) were
positive for Plasmodium falciparum; while P. vivax, P. falciparum and mixed
infections accounted for 74.5% of the study subjects. All the 384 study subjects 
possessed insecticide-treated bednets; 50.5% possessed one, 39.3% two and 10.2%
more than two. According to the logistic regression, there was significant
association between illness due to malaria and at least one of the explanatory
variables (χ26= 271.9, p<0.0001). For all Plasmodium species, education level,
and age appeared to be significant beneficial factors (OR<1 and negative
β-values). Occupation was a significant risk factor. Proper ITN utilization
improved with increasing educational status.
INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Schools may be appropriate for creating awareness
and distribution of ITN instead of the current mass campaign, which is less
effective. Efforts of stakeholders (schools, community health workers, and the
government) should be integrated.

INTRODUCTION: Pregnancy during the adolescent period is challenging mainly
because of the nutritional demands of both the adolescent and pregnancy period.
The risk for anaemia increases especially in developing countries such as Ghana
where malaria is endemic and the practice of pica is common. In this study, we
sought to determine the prevalence of anaemia, pica practice and malaria
infection among pregnant adolescent girls and assess the extent to which these
factors are associated.
METHODS: Two hundred and sixty five (265) pregnant adolescent girls were
recruited from three hospitals in Accra. Haemoglobin levels, malaria infection
and the practice of pica were assessed. Pearson's Chi squared tests were used to 
determine associations and logistic regression analysis was used to determine the
odds of being anaemic. Significance was set at p≤0.05.
RESULTS: Anaemia prevalence was 76% with severity ranging from mild (47.8%) to
severe (0.8%). About 27.5% were moderately anaemic. Pica was practiced in only
9.1% of the girls. Malaria infection was prevalent in 17.7% of the girls. The
logistic regression analysis indicated that pregnant girls with malaria infection
were 3.56 times more likely to be anaemic when compared to those without malaria.
Also, those who practiced pica were 1.23 times more likely to be anaemic when
compared to those who did not practice pica.
CONCLUSION: Anaemia is very prevalent in pregnant adolescent girls and is a
public health problem. Drastic measures should be taken to reduce the high
prevalence.

BACKGROUND: A unit of the European Mobile Laboratory (EMLab) consortium was
deployed to the Ebola virus disease (EVD) treatment unit in Guéckédou, Guinea,
from March 2014 through March 2015.
METHODS: The unit diagnosed EVD and malaria, using the RealStar Filovirus Screen 
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) kit and a malaria rapid 
diagnostic test, respectively.
RESULTS: The cleaned EMLab database comprised 4719 samples from 2741 cases of
suspected EVD from Guinea. EVD was diagnosed in 1231 of 2178 hospitalized
patients (57%) and in 281 of 563 who died in the community (50%). Children aged
<15 years had the highest proportion of Ebola virus-malaria parasite
coinfections. The case-fatality ratio was high in patients aged <5 years (80%)
and those aged >74 years (90%) and low in patients aged 10-19 years (40%). On
admission, RT-PCR analysis of blood specimens from patients who died in the
hospital yielded a lower median cycle threshold (Ct) than analysis of blood
specimens from survivors (18.1 vs 23.2). Individuals who died in the community
had a median Ct of 21.5 for throat swabs. Multivariate logistic regression on
1047 data sets revealed that low Ct values, ages of <5 and ≥45 years, and, among 
children aged 5-14 years, malaria parasite coinfection were independent
determinants of a poor EVD outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: Virus load, age, and malaria parasite coinfection play a role in the
outcome of EVD.

Malaria detection through microscopic examination of stained blood smears is a
diagnostic challenge that heavily relies on the expertise of trained
microscopists. This paper presents an automated analysis method for detection and
staging of red blood cells infected by the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum
at trophozoite or schizont stage. Unlike previous efforts in this area, this
study uses quantitative phase images of unstained cells. Erythrocytes are
automatically segmented using thresholds of optical phase and refocused to enable
quantitative comparison of phase images. Refocused images are analyzed to extract
23 morphological descriptors based on the phase information. While all individual
descriptors are highly statistically different between infected and uninfected
cells, each descriptor does not enable separation of populations at a level
satisfactory for clinical utility. To improve the diagnostic capacity, we applied
various machine learning techniques, including linear discriminant classification
(LDC), logistic regression (LR), and k-nearest neighbor classification (NNC), to 
formulate algorithms that combine all of the calculated physical parameters to
distinguish cells more effectively. Results show that LDC provides the highest
accuracy of up to 99.7% in detecting schizont stage infected cells compared to
uninfected RBCs. NNC showed slightly better accuracy (99.5%) than either LDC
(99.0%) or LR (99.1%) for discriminating late trophozoites from uninfected RBCs. 
However, for early trophozoites, LDC produced the best accuracy of 98%.
Discrimination of infection stage was less accurate, producing high specificity
(99.8%) but only 45.0%-66.8% sensitivity with early trophozoites most often
mistaken for late trophozoite or schizont stage and late trophozoite and schizont
stage most often confused for each other. Overall, this methodology points to a
significant clinical potential of using quantitative phase imaging to detect and 
stage malaria infection without staining or expert analysis.

Higher use of maternal and neonatal health (MNH) services may reduce maternal and
neonatal mortality in Kenya. This study aims to: 1) prospectively explore women's
intentions to use MNH services (antenatal care, delivery in a facility, postnatal
care, neonatal care) at <20 and 30-35 weeks' gestation and their actual use of
these services; 2) identify predictors of intention-behavior discordance among
women with positive service use intentions; 3) examine associations between place
of delivery, women's reasons for choosing it, and birthing experiences. We used
data from a 2012-2013 population-based cohort of pregnant women in the
Demographic Surveillance Site in Nyanza province, Kenya. Of 1,056 women
completing the study (89.1% response rate), 948 had live-births and 22
stillbirths, and they represent our analytic sample. Logistic regression analysis
identified predictors of intention-behavior discordance regarding delivery in a
facility and use of postnatal and neonatal care. At <20 and 30-35 weeks'
gestation, most women intended to seek MNH services (≥93.9% and ≥87.5%,
respectively, for all services assessed). Actual service use was high for
antenatal (98.1%) and neonatal (88.5%) care, but lower for delivery in a facility
(76.9%) and postnatal care (51.8%). Woman's age >35 and high-school education
were significant predictors of intention-behavior discordance regarding delivery 
in a facility; several delivery-related factors were significantly associated
with intention-behavior discordance regarding use of postnatal and neonatal care.
Delivery facilities were chosen based on proximity to women's residence,
affordability, and service quality; among women who delivered outside a health
facility, 16.3% could not afford going to a facility. Good/very good birth
experiences were reported by 93.6% of women who delivered in a facility and 32.6%
of women who did not. We found higher MNH service utilization than previously
documented in Nyanza province. Further increasing the number of facility
deliveries and use of postnatal care may improve MNH in Kenya.

BACKGROUND: In Côte d'Ivoire, malaria remains a major public health issue, and
thus a priority to be tackled. The aim of this study was to identify spatially
explicit indicators of Plasmodium falciparum infection among school-aged children
and to undertake a model-based spatial prediction of P. falciparum infection risk
using environmental predictors.
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted, including parasitological
examinations and interviews with more than 5,000 children from 93 schools across 
Côte d'Ivoire. A finger-prick blood sample was obtained from each child to
determine Plasmodium species-specific infection and parasitaemia using
Giemsa-stained thick and thin blood films. Household socioeconomic status was
assessed through asset ownership and household characteristics. Children were
interviewed for preventive measures against malaria. Environmental data were
gathered from satellite images and digitized maps. A Bayesian geostatistical
stochastic search variable selection procedure was employed to identify factors
related to P. falciparum infection risk. Bayesian geostatistical logistic
regression models were used to map the spatial distribution of P. falciparum
infection and to predict the infection prevalence at non-sampled locations via
Bayesian kriging.
RESULTS: Complete data sets were available from 5,322 children aged 5-16 years
across Côte d'Ivoire. P. falciparum was the predominant species (94.5 %). The
Bayesian geostatistical variable selection procedure identified land cover and
socioeconomic status as important predictors for infection risk with P.
falciparum. Model-based prediction identified high P. falciparum infection risk
in the north, central-east, south-east, west and south-west of Côte d'Ivoire.
Low-risk areas were found in the south-eastern area close to Abidjan and the
south-central and west-central part of the country.
CONCLUSIONS: The P. falciparum infection risk and related uncertainty estimates
for school-aged children in Côte d'Ivoire represent the most up-to-date malaria
risk maps. These tools can be used for spatial targeting of malaria control
interventions.

BACKGROUND: Indoor residual spraying (IRS) is used as part of the integrated
vector management strategy for the control of malaria in Lagos, Nigeria. The
purpose of this study was to compare the malariometric indices of children under 
5 years old living in IRS-implementing and non-IRS-implementing communities of
Lagos, Nigeria.
METHODS: The study was a community-based, comparative, cross-sectional study of
480 children under five recruited using a multi-stage sampling method. Data on
each child were collected using a household questionnaire administered to the
consenting care-giver of each selected child. Each child underwent a
comprehensive physical examination. On-the-spot malaria rapid diagnostic testing 
and haemoglobin estimation to assess parasitaemia and anaemia, respectively, were
also carried out. Risk factors for parasitaemia and anaemia were identified using
multivariate logistic regression.
RESULTS: A total of 238 children were studied in the IRS-implementing group while
242 children were studied in the non-IRS-implementing group. The IRS
-implementing community had a lower level of parasitaemia (1.3 %) compared to the
non-IRS-implementing community (5.8 %) (p < 0.001). There was no significant
difference in anaemia, spleen rate and fever in the IRS-implementing group (10.9,
9.7 and 5 %) and the non-IRS-implementing group (9.9, 8.8 and 8.7 %),
respectively. Residing in an IRS-implementing community was associated with lower
odds of parasitaemia (OR 0.17, p < 0.01). Sleeping under a bed net was the only
factor associated with anaemia (p < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: IRS has led to a reduction in the level of parasitaemia in the
under-fives in the study areas.

BACKGROUND: Perturbations of blood sodium are the most frequently encountered
electrolyte disorder in sick children, and may influence fluid therapy. We
examined the frequency of blood sodium perturbations, and factors and outcomes
associated with hyponatremia in children admitted to a rural Kenyan hospital and 
investigated the risk factors associated with deaths in hyponatremic children.
METHODS: Plasma sodium levels and other laboratory parameters were measured in
children admitted to a rural Kenyan hospital. Clinical measurements were
collected using standard forms and entered into a computer database. The
proportion of children admitted with hyponatremia was determined. Logistic
regression models were used to investigate factors associated with hyponatremia, 
and death in those with hyponatremia.
RESULTS: Abnormal plasma sodium occurred in 46.6% (95% confidence interval
(95%CI) 43.5-49.6%) of 1026 pediatric admissions. Hyponatremia occurred in 44.4% 
(95%CI 41.4-47.5%) and hypernatremia in 2.1% (95%CI 1.3-3.0%). Malaria (40.8%)
was the most common underlying primary diagnosis in hyponatremic children.
Malaria, hyperglycemia, wasting, high creatinine levels and preserved
consciousness were associated with hyponatremia. Pallor and seizures were
associated with increased mortality in hyponatremic children.
CONCLUSIONS: Sodium disturbances are common in pediatric admissions to a County
hospital in rural Kenya. Seizures and pallor were predictors of mortality in
hyponatremic children.

BACKGROUND: This study responds to a rural community's concern that, despite
national initiatives, malaria management in young children falls short of
national guidelines in their district. This study aimed to: (1) describe
caregivers' treatment-seeking behaviors in the rural district of Butaleja, (2)
estimate the percentage of children who received an appropriate antimalarial, and
(3) determine factors that maximized the likelihood of receiving an appropriate
antimalarial. Appropriate antimalarial in this study is defined as having
received only the Uganda's age-specific first-line malaria treatment for
uncomplicated and severe malaria during the course of the febrile illness.
METHODS: A household survey design was used in 2011 to interview 424 caregivers
with a child aged five and under who had fever within the two weeks preceding the
survey. The survey evaluated factors that included: knowledge about malaria and
its treatment, management practices, decision-making, and access to artemisinin
combination therapy (ACT) and information sources. Bivariate analysis, followed
by logistic regression, was used to determine predictors of the likelihood of
receiving an appropriate antimalarial.
RESULTS: Home management was the most common first action, with most children
requiring a subsequent action to manage their fever. Overall, 20.9 % of children 
received a blood test, 68.4 % received an antimalarial, and 41.0 % received an
ACT. But closer inspection showed that only 31.6 % received an appropriate
antimalarial. These results confirm that ACT usage and receipt of an appropriate 
antimalarial in Butaleja remain well below the 2010/2015 target of 85 %. While
nine survey items differentiated significantly whether a child had or had not
received an appropriate antimalarial, our logistic regression model identified
four items as independent predictors of likelihood that a child would receive an 
appropriate antimalarial: obtaining antimalarials from regulated outlets
(OR = 14.99); keeping ACT in the home for future use (OR = 6.36); reporting they 
would select ACT given the choice (OR = 2.31); and child's age older than
four months (OR = 5.67).
CONCLUSIONS: Few children in Butaleja received malaria treatment in accordance
with national guidelines. This study highlighted the importance of engaging the
full spectrum of stakeholders in the management of malaria in young children -
including licensed and unlicensed providers, caregivers, and family members.

BACKGROUND: Routine immunisation (RI) contributes immensely to reduction in
mortality from vaccine preventable diseases (VPD) among children. The Nigerian
Demographic and Health Survey, 2008 revealed that only 58 % of children in Osun
State had received all recommended vaccines, which is far below World Health
Organization (WHO) target of 80 %. We therefore, assessed RI uptake and its
determinants among children in Atakumosa-west district of Osun State.
METHODS: Atakumosa-west district has an estimated population of 90,525
inhabitants. We enrolled 750 mothers of children aged 12-23 months in this
cross-sectional study. Semi-structured questionnaires were used to obtain data on
socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge of mothers on RI, history of RI in
children and factors associated with full RI uptake. A fully-immunised child was 
defined as a child who had received one dose of Bacillus-Calmette-Guerin, three
doses of Oral-Polio-Vaccine, three doses of Diptheria-Pertusis-Tetanus vaccine
and one dose of measles vaccine by 12 months of age. We tested for the
association between immunisation uptake and its likely determinants using
multivariable logistic regression at 0.05 level of significance and 95 %
confidence Interval (CI).
RESULTS: Mean ± (SD) age of the mothers and children were 27.9 ± 6.1 years and
17.2 ± 4.0 months, respectively. About 94 % (703/750) of mothers had received
antenatal care (ANC) and 63.3 % (475) of the children possessed vaccination
cards. Seventy-six percent (571/750) had good knowledge of RI and VPD. About 58 %
(275/475) of children who possessed vaccination card were fully-immunised.
Mothers antenatal care attendance (aOR = 3.3, 95 % CI = 1.1-8.3), maternal
tetanus toxoid immunisation (aOR = 3.2, 95 % CI = 1.1-10.0) access to
immunisation information (aOR = 1.8, 95 % CI = 1.1-2.5) and mothers having good
knowledge of immunisation (aOR = 2.4, 95 % CI = 1.6-3.8) were significant
determinants of full immunisation.
CONCLUSIONS: Routine immunisation uptake was still below WHO target in the study 
area. Encouraging mothers to attend antenatal care and educational interventions 
targeted at rural mothers are recommended to improve vaccination status of
children in the rural communities.

the ability to replicate within its host, leading to long-lasting and potentially
fatal infections. It is ubiquitous and its worldwide prevalence has recently been
estimated to be at least half that of hookworm. Information on the epidemiology
of S. stercoralis remains scarce and modalities for its large-scale control are
yet to be determined.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A community-based two-year cohort study was
conducted among the general population in a rural province in North Cambodia. At 
each survey, participants infected with S. stercoralis were treated with a single
oral dose of ivermectin (200μg/kg BW). Diagnosis was performed using a
combination of the Baermann method and Koga agar plate culture on two stool
samples. The cohort included participants from eight villages who were either
positive or negative for S. stercoralis at baseline. Mixed logistic regression
models were employed to assess risk factors for S. stercoralis infection at
baseline and re-infection at follow-up. A total of 3,096 participants were
examined at baseline, revealing a S. stercoralis prevalence of 33.1%. Of these
participants, 1,269 were followed-up over two years. Re-infection and infection
rates among positive and negative participants at baseline were 14.4% and 9.6% at
the first and 11.0% and 11.5% at the second follow-up, respectively. At
follow-up, all age groups were at similar risk of acquiring an infection, while
infection risk significantly decreased with increasing village sanitation
coverage.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Chemotherapy-based control of S. stercoralis is
feasible and highly beneficial, particularly in combination with improved
sanitation. The impact of community-based ivermectin treatment on S. stercoralis 
was high, with over 85% of villagers remaining negative one year after treatment.
The integration of S. stercoralis into existing STH control programs should be
considered without further delay.

BACKGROUND: Lack of data in marginalized populations on knowledge, attitudes and 
practices (KAP) hampers efforts to improve modern contraceptive practice. A mixed
methods study to better understand family planning KAP amongst refugee and
migrant women on the Thailand-Myanmar border was conducted as part of an ongoing 
effort to improve reproductive health, particularly maternal mortality, through
Shoklo Malaria Research Unit (SMRU) antenatal and birthing services.
METHODS: Cross-sectional surveys and focus group discussions (FGDs) in currently 
pregnant women; and in-depth interviews (IDIs) in selected post-partum women with
three children or more; were conducted. Quantitative data were described with
medians and proportions and compared using standard statistical tests. Risk
factors associated with high parity (>3) were identified using logistic
regression analysis. Qualitative data were coded and grouped and discussed using 
identified themes.
RESULTS: In January-March 2015, 978 women participated in cross-sectional
studies, 120 in FGD and 21 in IDI. Major positive findings were: > 90 % of women 
knew about contraceptives for birth spacing, >60 % of women in the FGD and IDI
reported use of family planning (FP) in the past and nearly all women knew where 
they could obtain FP supplies. Major gaps identified included: low uptake of long
acting contraception (LAC), lack of awareness of emergency contraception (>90 %
of women), unreliable estimates of when child bearing years end, and
misconceptions surrounding female sterilization. Three was identified as the
ideal number of children in the cross-sectional survey but less than half of the 
women with this parity or higher in the IDI actually adopted LAC leaving them at 
risk for unintended pregnancy. Discussing basic female anatomy using a simple
diagram was well received in FGD and IDIs. LAC uptake has increased particularly 
the IUD from 2013-2015.
CONCLUSION: Definitive contextual issues were identified during this study and a 
significant range of action points have been implemented in FP services at SMRU
as a result, particularly in regard to the IUD. The importance of the role and
attitudes of husbands were acknowledged by women and studies to investigate male 
perspectives in future may enhance FP practice in this area.

BACKGROUND: Mass distribution campaigns of insecticide-treated nets for malaria
prevention are usually accompanied by intensive behaviour change communication
(BCC) to encourage hanging and use of nets. However, data on the effectiveness of
these communication efforts are scarce. In preparation for the next round of mass
campaigns in Nigeria, a secondary analysis of existing data from post-campaign
surveys was undertaken to investigate the influence of BCC on net hanging and
use.
METHODS: Surveys were undertaken between 2009 and 2012 in ten states in Nigeria
using standardized questionnaires. Two-stage cluster sampling was used to select 
households in each study site. Outcomes were defined as the effects of BCC
message exposure and recall on knowledge, attitudes, perception as well as
intentions and actual use. From the univariable analysis, potential confounders
and explanatory variables were identified and key effects explored in
multivariable linear or logistic regression models; terms in the models were kept
if they had a marginal significance with p < 0.2. To quantify the effects from
BCC, a treatment effect model was used with an inverse-probability weight
regression adjustment.
RESULTS: More than half of the respondents (58.4 %; 95 % CI 56.0, 60.7) had heard
a message about net use or hanging during or after the distribution campaign,
with media cited as the most common source of information. Attitude towards net
use was positively linked to the number of messages recalled and was overall
better in the northern study sites. The number of messages recalled was also the 
strongest predictor of knowledge (p < 0.001). All BCC outcomes showed a
significant increase in net use, which was strongest for the confidence to take
action regarding nets with an overall effect of 17 %-point increase of net use
comparing poor and excellent confidence levels. Intention to use every night
increased net use by 15 %-points and discussing net use in the family by 8 %
points. All these effects were statistically significant (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Multichannel BCC campaigns as well as other media were effective in 
contributing to an increase in net culture, hanging and use, particularly by
vulnerable groups.

BACKGROUND: This study was conducted in Bura irrigation scheme in Tana River
County and the pastoral area in Ijara, Garissa County in the eastern Kenya to
establish the knowledge, attitude and practices on malaria transmission, control 
and management, and determine malaria prevalence and the associated risk factors.
METHODS: A cross sectional survey design that involved 493 randomly selected
people from 334 households was used between November and December 2013. All the
randomly selected people were screened for malaria parasites using rapid
diagnostic test (RDT)-Carestart™ malaria HRP2 (pf) kit. A questionnaire was
administered to determine potential risk factors and perceptions on malaria
exposure within a period of 2 months prior to the survey. Two logistic regression
models were fitted to the data; one used the RDT results while the other used
data from the questionnaire survey.
RESULTS: Using RDT, the prevalence of malaria was 4.68 % (95 % CI: 1.48-7.88 %)
and 0.31 % (-0.30 to 0.92 %) in irrigated and non-irrigated areas, respectively. 
From the questionnaires, 14.62 % (9.27-19.97 %) and 23.91 % (19.23-28.60 %) of
the participants perceived to have had malaria in the irrigated and pastoral
areas, respectively. The main malaria control measure was the use of bed nets:
average of three nets per household in Bura irrigation scheme and one in Ijara.
Artemether-lumefantrine was the main drug of choice mainly in the irrigated area 
while sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine was likely to be used in the non-irrigated area. 
Households located >5 km from the nearest health facility had higher prevalence
of Plasmodium infection than those located ≤5 km.
CONCLUSION: The residents of Bura irrigation scheme were more likely to be
infected compared to those living in the non-irrigated area of Ijara. However,
those in the non-irrigated area were more likely to be treated or use
over-the-counter medication for perceived malaria illnesses compared to those in 
the irrigated area. There is a need, therefore, to formulate effective ways of
managing malaria especially in irrigated areas and build capacity on differential
diagnosis for malaria, especially in the pastoral areas.

BACKGROUND: Network analyses have been widely utilized to evaluate large
datasets, but have not yet been used to explore factors associated with risk
behaviours. In combination with traditional regression analysis, network analyses
may provide useful information and highlight key factors for reducing needle
sharing behaviours among people who inject drugs (PWID).
METHODS: Sociodemographic data, and information on injection behaviour and sexual
practices were collected from a cross-sectional survey that was conducted with
PWID in five prefectures of Yunnan province, China. A combination of logistic
regression and correlation network analyses were used to explore key factors for 
reducing needle-sharing behaviours among PWID.
RESULTS: In a total of 1 049 PWID, 37.5 % had a history of needle or syringe
sharing. The logistic analysis showed that Zhaotong, Qujing, Dehong, or Lincang
residents, diazepam use, longer injection duration, needle reuse, and infection
with HIV, viral hepatitis, tuberculosis and/or malaria were independently
associated with needle sharing. The correlation network analyses showed that,
compared to PWID who had never shared needles, PWID who did share needles would
achieve harm reduction goals faster and more permanently. HIV serostatus and
marital status were found to be closely associated with other risk factors. By
combining regression analyses with network analyses, it was shown that PWID who
are HIV seropositive will be an ideal target group for harm reduction programs.
CONCLUSION: Needle-sharing behaviours are common among PWID in Yunnan, and harm
reduction programs may help PWID who are HIV seropositive reduce risk behaviours 
and prevent blood borne diseases.

BACKGROUND: Maternal mortality is highest in sub-Saharan Africa. In Uganda, the
WHO- MDG 5 (aimed at reducing maternal mortality by 75 % between 1990 and 2015)
has not been attained. The current maternal mortality ratio (MMR) in Uganda is
438 per 100,000 live births coming from 550 per 100,000 in 1990. This study sets 
out to find causes and predictors of maternal deaths in a tertiary University
teaching Hospital in Uganda.
METHODS: The study was a retrospective unmatched case control study which was
carried out at the maternity unit of Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital (MRRH).
The sample included pregnant women aged 15-49 years admitted to the Maternity
unit between January 2011 and November 2014. Data from patient charts of 139
maternal deaths (cases) and 417 controls was collected using a standard
audit/data extraction form. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used
to assess for the factors associated with maternal mortality.
RESULTS: Direct causes of mortality accounted for 77.7 % while indirect causes
contributed 22.3 %. The most frequent cause of maternal mortality was puerperal
sepsis (30.9 %), followed by obstetric hemorrhage (21.6 %), hypertensive
disorders in pregnancy (14.4 %), abortion complications (10.8 %). Malaria was the
commonest indirect cause of mortality accounting for 8.92 %. On multivariable
logistic regression analysis, the factors associated with maternal mortality
were: primary or no education (OR 1.9; 95 % CI, 1.0-3.3); HIV positive
sero-status (OR, 3.6; 95 % CI, 1.9-7.0); no antenatal care attendance (OR 3.6;
95 % CI, 1.8-7.0); rural dwellers (OR, 4.5; 95 % CI, 2.5-8.3); having been
referred from another health facility (OR 5.0; 95 % CI, 2.9-10.0); delay to seek 
health care (delay-1) (OR 36.9; 95 % CI, 16.2-84.4).
CONCLUSIONS: Most maternal deaths occur among mothers from rural areas,
uneducated, HIV positive, unbooked mothers (lack of antenatal care), referred
mothers in critical conditions and mothers delaying to seek health care.
Puerperal sepsis is the leading cause of maternal deaths at Mbarara Regional
Referral Hospital. Therefore more research into puerperal sepsis to describe the 
microbiology and epidemiology of sepsis is recommended.

Children, especially infants, are highly vulnerable to iron-deficiency anemia
because of their rapid growth of the brain and the rest of the body. The
objectives of this study were to compare the prevalence of iron-deficiency anemia
in infants born from HIV-positive mothers and HIV-negative mothers and to
identify the determinants of iron-deficiency anemia in infants.A comparative
cross-sectional study was conducted in Bahir Dar city. Simple random sampling
technique was used to select the study participants. Mothers were interviewed;
blood samples were collected from mothers and infants to measure the hemoglobin
level and anthropometric indicators were obtained from the infants using world
health organization standards. Descriptive statistics were used to estimate the
prevalence of infantile anemia. Binary logistic regression and multiple linear
regressions were used to identify the determinants of infant anemia.A total of
1459 infants born from HIV-positive and HIV-negative mothers were included. The
prevalence of iron-deficiency anemia in infants born from HIV-positive and
HIV-negative mothers was 41.9% (95% CI: 39-44). Infantile iron-deficiency anemia 
was associated with maternal HIV infection (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.54 [95%
CI: 1.65-3.9]), stunting (AOR 3.46 [95% CI: 2.41-4.97]), low income (AOR 2.72
[95% CI: 2-3.73]), maternal malaria during pregnancy (AOR 1.81 [95% CI:
1.33-2.47]), use of cow milk before 6 month (AOR 1.82 [95% CI: 1.35-2.45]),
residence (AOR 0.09 [95% CI: 0.06-0.13]), history of cough or fever 7 days
preceding the survey (AOR 2.71 [95% CI: 1.99-3.69]), maternal hemoglobin (B 0.65 
[95% CI: 0.61-0.68]), educational status of mother (B 0.22 [95% CI: 0.2-0.23]),
age of the mother (B -0.03 [95% CI: -0.03, -0.02]), and family size (B -0.14 [95%
CI: -0.18,-0.11]).

BACKGROUND: The Dande Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) located
in Bengo Province, Angola, covers nearly 65,500 residents living in approximately
19,800 households. This study aims to describe the main causes of deaths (CoD)
occurred within the HDSS, from 2009 to 2012, and to explore associations between 
demographic or socioeconomic factors and broad mortality groups (Group
I-Communicable diseases, maternal, perinatal and nutritional conditions; Group
II-Non-communicable diseases; Group III-Injuries; IND-Indeterminate).
METHODS: Verbal Autopsies (VA) were performed after death identification during
routine HDSS visits. Associations between broad groups of CoD and sex, age,
education, socioeconomic position, place of residence and place of death, were
explored using chi-square tests and fitting logistic regression models.
RESULTS: From a total of 1488 deaths registered, 1009 verbal autopsies were
performed and 798 of these were assigned a CoD based on the 10(th) revision of
the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). Mortality was led by CD
(61.0 %), followed by IND (18.3 %), NCD (11.6 %) and INJ (9.1 %). Intestinal
infectious diseases, malnutrition and acute respiratory infections were the main 
contributors to under-five mortality (44.2 %). Malaria was the most common CoD
among children under 15 years old (38.6 %). Tuberculosis, traffic accidents and
malaria led the CoD among adults aged 15-49 (13.5 %, 10.5 % and 8.0 %
respectively). Among adults aged 50 or more, diseases of the circulatory system
(23.2 %) were the major CoD, followed by tuberculosis (8.2 %) and malaria
(7.7 %). CD were more frequent CoD among less educated people (adjusted odds
ratio, 95 % confidence interval for none vs. 5 or more years of school: 1.68,
1.04-2.72).
CONCLUSION: Infectious diseases were the leading CoD in this region. Verbal
autopsies proved useful to identify the main CoD, being an important tool in
settings where vital statistics are scarce and death registration systems have
limitations.

INTRODUCTION: birth weight is vital to the development potential of the newborn. 
Abnormal birth weight (such as low birth weight and macrosomia) is an important
determinant of child survival, disabilities, stunting, and long-term adverse
consequences for the onset of non-communicable diseases in the life course and
therefore demands appropriate public health interventions. Stillbirths are also
considered one of the most important, but most poorly understood and documented
adverse outcomes of pregnancy. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the
prevalence of abnormal birth weight and related maternal risk factors, as well as
pregnancy outcomes, such as stillbirth.
METHODS: a retrospective study design was used to analyze 4262 delivery records
for singleton pregnancies from January 2013 to December 2014 seen at the Hohoe
municipal hospital, Volta region in Ghana. The data on birth weight and related
factors were derived from the delivery book. Data was analyzed using STATA.
Multinomial logistic regression was used to assess the association between
maternal factors such as parity, age and intermittent preventive treatment of
malaria, sex of infant and abnormal birth weight. Association between stillbirth 
and related factors was assessed using logistic regression.
RESULTS: prevalence of low birth weight (<2.5kg) was 9.69% and macrosomia
(≥4.0kg) was 3.03%. There was an increased risk of a first born being of low
birth weight than second or third born (RR; 2.04, CI; 1.59-2.64, p<0.0001). There
were also an increased risks of mothers <20 years giving birth to low-birthweight
infants (RR; 1.46, CI; 1.11-1.93, p=0.007) compared to mothers who were within
the age ranges of 20-30 years and also among those who took only one (RR; 1.57,
CI; 1.02-2.39, p=0.039) or no intermittent preventive treatment for malaria
during pregnancy (RR; 1.57, CI; 1.24-1.98, p=<0.0001) compared to those who took 
three doses. Risk of macrosomic birth was particularly high among 5th born (RR;
2.66, CI; 1.43-4.95, p=0.002) compared to first or second born. Stillbirth rate
was 27/1000 births. Thirty-two percent of the stillbirths (n=38) had low birth
weight whereas 6.8% (n=8) were macrosomic. There was a greater than fivefold
(AOR; 5.6, CI; 3.6-8.7) and greater than twofold (AOR; 2.4, CI; 1.1-5.3, p=0.025)
increase in odds for stillbirth among low birth weight and macrosomic infants
respectively.
CONCLUSION: macrosomia and low birth weight co-existed among infants in Hohoe
municipality, both of which are associated with adverse pregnancy outcome such as
stillbirth. Given the apparent association between maternal age <20 years and
increased risk, health promotion strategies aimed at preventing pregnancies among
teenagers could be implemented to aid the reduction of stillbirth rates.

BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a water-borne and widespread spirochetal zoonosis
caused by pathogenic bacteria called leptospires. Human leptospirosis is an
important zoonotic infectious disease with frequent outbreaks in recent years in 
China. Leptospirosis's emergence has been linked to many environmental and
ecological drivers of disease transmission. In this paper, we identified the
environmental and socioeconomic factors associated with leptospirosis in China,
and predict potential risk area of leptospirosis using predictive models.
METHODS: Leptospirosis incidence data were derived from the database of China's
web-based infectious disease reporting system, a national surveillance network
maintained by Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. We built
statistical relationship between occurrence of leptospirosis and nine
environmental and socioeconomic risk factors using logistic regression model and 
Maxent model.
RESULTS: Both logistic regression model and Maxent model have high performance in
predicting the occurrence of leptospirosis, with AUC value of 0.95 and 0.96,
respectively. Annual mean temperature (Bio1) and annual total precipitation
(Bio12) are two most important variables governing the geographic distribution of
leptospirosis in China. The geographic distributions of areas at risk of
leptospirosis predicted from both models show high agreement. The risk areas are 
located mainly in seven provinces of China: Sichuan Province, Chongqing
Municipality, Hunan Province, Jiangxi Province, Guangdong Province, Guangxi
Province, and Hainan Province, where surveillance and control programs are
urgently needed. Logistic regression model and Maxent model predicted that 403
and 464 counties are at very high risk of leptospirosis, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the importance of socioeconomic and
environmental variables and predictive models in identifying risk areas for
leptospirosis in China. The values of Geographic Information System and
predictive models were demonstrated for investigating the geographic
distribution, estimating socioeconomic and environmental risk factors, and
enhancing our understanding of leptospirosis in China.

BACKGROUND: Prenatal exposure to Plasmodium falciparum affects development of
protective immunity and susceptibility to subsequent natural challenges with
similar parasite antigens. However, the nature of these effects has not been
fully elucidated. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of prenatal
exposure to P. falciparum on susceptibility to natural malaria infection, with a 
focus on median time from birth to first clinical malaria episode and frequency
of clinical malaria episodes in the first 2 years of life.
METHODS: A prospective birth cohort study was conducted in Rufiji district in
Tanzania, between January 2013 and December 2015. Infants born to mothers with P.
falciparum in the placenta at time of delivery were defined as exposed, and
infants born to mothers without P. falciparum parasites in placenta were defined 
as unexposed. Placental infection was established by histological techniques. Out
of 206 infants recruited, 41 were in utero exposed to P. falciparum and 165
infants were unexposed. All infants were monitored for onset of clinical malaria 
episodes in the first 2 years of life. The outcome measure was time from birth to
first clinical malaria episode, defined by fever (≥37 °C) and microscopically
determined parasitaemia. Median time to first clinical malaria episode between
exposed and unexposed infants was assessed using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis
and comparison was done by log rank. Association of clinical malaria episodes
with prenatal exposure to P. falciparum was assessed by multivariate binary
logistic regression. Comparative analysis of mean number of clinical malaria
episodes between exposed and unexposed infants was done using independent sample 
t test.
RESULTS: The effect of prenatal exposure to P. falciparum infection on clinical
malaria episodes was statistically significant (Odds Ratio of 4.79, 95 % CI
2.21-10.38, p < 0.01) when compared to other confounding factors. Median time
from birth to first clinical malaria episode for exposed and unexposed infants
was 32 weeks (95 % CI 30.88-33.12) and 37 weeks (95 % CI 35.25-38.75),
respectively, and the difference was statistically significant (p = 0.003). The
mean number of clinical malaria episodes in exposed and unexposed infants was
0.51 and 0.30 episodes/infant, respectively, and the difference was statistically
significant (p = 0.038).
CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal exposure to P. falciparum shortens time from birth to first
clinical malaria episode and increases frequency of clinical malaria episodes in 
the first 2 years of life.

BACKGROUND: Ethiopia constitutes approximately 1% of the world's population but
it contributes to 7% of the world's HIV/AIDS cases. Malaria is the most important
disease of humans in terms of mortality, morbidity, and long-term effects upon
quality of life, especially in Ethiopia. Despite the ongoing efforts and progress
in fighting HIV/AIDS and malaria, these diseases remain the leading cause of
morbidity and mortality in the country. In this study, we assessed community
knowledge and the role of health extension workers on integrated diseases among
households in East Hararghe Zone, Ethiopia.
METHODS: A community-based multistage stratified cross-sectional study was
conducted from February to March 2014 among six woredas of the East Hararghe
Zone, Ethiopia. The data were collected from 2,319 households using structured
questionnaires. A total of 12 well trained data collectors conducted a
face-to-face interview with the head female of each household. The data entered
on Epi-Data version 3 were then exported for analysis on STATA version 11.
RESULTS: Multivariable logistic regression showed that among the 1,967 (92.7%)
study participants who scored above the mean value in regard to the overall
knowledge of HIV/AIDS, study participants who could read/write (adjusted odd
ratios [AOR] =2.54, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.15-5.61, P=0.021) and worked 
as a daily laborer (AOR =0.40, 95% CI: 0.17-0.91, P=0.029) were significantly
associated with comprehensive knowledge about HIV/AIDS. Meanwhile, out of the
2,172 eligible study participants for the malaria interview, 934 (43%) scored
above the mean in regard to the overall knowledge about malaria. Rural residents 
(AOR =0.27, 95% CI: 0.17-0.44, P<0.005), >45 years of age (AOR =1.44, 95% CI:
1.04-1.99, P=0.030), and single marital status (AOR =3.81, 95% CI: 1.97-7.37,
P<0.005) were significantly associated with comprehensive knowledge about
malaria.
CONCLUSION: Based on the findings of this study, health extension workers' number
of monthly regular visits of each household was high, with the overall knowledge 
of study participants regarding malaria was unsatisfactory, unlike the overall
knowledge of study participants regarding HIV/AIDS, which is very high.

BACKGROUND: The immune response against Plasmodium vivax immunogenic epitopes is 
regulated by pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines that determine antibody levels 
and class switching. Cytokine gene polymorphisms may be responsible for changes
in the humoral immune response against malaria. The aim of this study was to
evaluate whether polymorphisms in the TNFA, IFNG and IL10 genes would alter the
levels of anti-PvAMA1, PvDBP and -PvMSP-119 IgG antibodies in patients with vivax
malaria.
METHODS: Samples from 90 vivax malaria-infected and 51 uninfected subjects from
an endemic area of the Brazilian Amazon were genotyped using polymerase chain
reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) to identify
polymorphisms of the genes TNFA (-1031T > C, -308G > A, -238G > A), IFNG
(+874T > A) and IL10 (-819C > T, -592C > A). The levels of total IgG against
PvAMA1, PvDBP and PvMSP-119 were determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay (ELISA). Associations between the polymorphisms and the antibody response
were assessed by means of logistic regression models.
RESULTS: No significant differences were found in the levels of IgG antibodies
against the PvAMA-1, PvDBP or PvMSP-119 proteins in relation to the studied
polymorphisms.
CONCLUSIONS: Although no associations were found among the evaluated genotypes
and alleles and anti-merozoite IgG class P. vivax antibody levels, this study
helps elucidate the immunogenic profile involved in the humoral immune response
in malaria.

BACKGROUND: Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), malaria and tuberculosis dominate
the disease pattern in Myanmar. Due to urbanization, westernized lifestyle and
economic development, it is likely that NCDs such as cerebrovascular disease and 
ischemic heart disease are on a rise. The leading behavioral- and metabolic NCDs 
risk factors are tobacco smoke, dietary risks and alcohol use, and high blood
pressure and body mass index, respectively. The study aimed at estimating the
prevalence and determinants of hypertension, including metabolic-, behavioral-
and socio-demographic risk factors.
METHODS: A nationwide, cross-sectional study of 7429 citizens of Myanmar aged
15-64 years were examined in 2009, using the WHO STEPS methodology. In separate
analyses by gender, odds radios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) for
determinants of hypertension were estimated using logistic regression analyses.
Confounders included in analyses were chosen based on Directed acyclic graphs
(DAGs).
RESULTS: The prevalence of hypertension was 30.1 % (95 % CI: 28.4-31.8) in males 
and 29.8 % (28.5-31.1) in females. The mean BMI was 21.7 (SD 4.3) kg/m(2) for
males and 23.0 (5.1) kg/m(2) for females. In fully adjusted analyses, we found in
both genders increased OR for hypertension if the participants had high BMI
(males: OR = 2.6; 95 % CI 2.1-3.3, females: OR = 2.3; 2.0-2.7) and high waist
circumference (males: OR = 3.4; 1.8-6.8, females: OR = 2.7; 2.2-3.3). In both
sexes, associations were also found between hypertension and low physical
activity at work, or living in urban areas or the delta region. Being underweight
and use of sesame oil in cooking was associated with lower odds for hypertension.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of hypertension was high and associated with
metabolic-, behavioral- and socio-demographic factors. Due to expected rapid
economic growth in Myanmar we recommend similar studies in the future to follow
up and describe trends in the risk factors, especially modifiable factors, which 
will most likely be on rise. Studies on effectiveness on interventions are
needed, and policies to reduce the burden of NCD risk factors should be
implemented if proven effective in similar settings.

BACKGROUND: Public malaria health promotion is an integral part of the national
malaria elimination programme, which was launched by the Chinese government in
2010. However, the public awareness of malaria needs to improve. This study aims 
to explore the determinants of public awareness of malaria.
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted using stratified sampling method 
from June 2015 to March 2016. Bivariate logistic regression was performed to
explore the association between predictors and malaria awareness in the sample
population. The homogeneity of the interaction between group assignment and the
degree of knowledge related to malaria among the subgroups was calculated by
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test.
RESULTS: Community media (including bulletin boards of village clinics or
township hospitals, newspapers, exercise books, shopping bags, aprons, disposable
cups, leaflets and banner advertisements) was the most prominent determinant
influencing public awareness of malaria. The probability of having high-degree of
knowledge about malaria among participants who received malaria-related
information from community media were 3.99 times greater than those who did not
(odds ratio 3.99, 95 % confidence interval 3.04-5.25, p < 0.001). Moreover,
socio-demographic predictors including age, distance to township hospital,
endemic county type, history of suffering from malaria, electronic media,
self-assessed household income level, educational attainment and the knowledge
about malaria were clearly associated with public awareness of malaria.
CONCLUSIONS: Community media played the most important role in public awareness
of malaria. However, only a few participants have received malaria knowledge
through this media. It suggests that community media was an effective publicity
material, which should expand its coverage. Malaria health promotion campaign
needs to be aligned with target populations, in particular, people who are under 
45 years old and residents (especially in type-3 counties) in remote areas.

BACKGROUND: There is little data on the risk factors for malaria infection in
large cities in central Africa and in all age groups. There may be different
associations with the risk factors for areas with different malaria transmission 
intensities such as the effect of fever or age. This study aimed at identifying
risk factors associated with Plasmodium infection and anaemia among children
6-59 months and individuals aged older than 5 years in Kinshasa, a large city
with heterogeneity in malaria prevalence.
METHODS: This study analysed data from 3342 children aged 6-59 months from 25
non-rural health zones (HZs) and for 816 individuals aged older than 5 years from
two HZs in Kinshasa (non-rural), collected during a cross sectional malaria
survey in 2011. Logistic regression with random effects was used to investigate
predictors for malaria and anaemia. Differences in risk factors in areas with a
prevalence of less than 10 and 10 % or greater were investigated.
RESULTS: There was evidence of a different age-pattern in the two transmission
settings. For children under 5 years, the highest prevalence of malaria was
observed in the 48-59 months group in both transmission settings, but it
increased more gently for the lower transmission HZs (p = 0.009). In a separate
analysis in children over 5 years in two selected HZs, the peak prevalence was in
5-9 years old in the higher transmission setting and in 15-19 years old in the
lower transmission setting. Reported fever was associated with malaria in both
transmission strata, with no evidence of a difference in these associations
(p = 0.71); however in children older than 5 years there was a significant
interaction with a stronger association in the low transmission HZ.
Insecticide-treated net (ITN) use was associated with a lower risk of malaria
infection in children 6-59 months in the high transmission HZs. Similar estimates
were found in children over 5 years and the lower transmission HZ but the
associations there were not significant. There was no evidence of a difference in
these associations by strata. The risk of anaemia decreased with increasing age
in all strata, whereas it increased with malaria infection and reported fever.
ITN use did not show evidence of protection against anaemia. Low socio-economic
status was associated with malaria in high transmission setting in children
6-59 months and anaemia in low transmission setting.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that in areas of low transmission in Kinshasa, the 
peak prevalence occurs in older age groups however ITN use was highest in
children under 5 years. Targeted distribution of ITN to all age groups should be 
continued. For most risk factors, there was no evidence of an interaction with
transmission intensity however the associations with age and with fever in the
last 2 weeks did vary significantly.

We tested the hypothesis that avian haemosporidian (malaria) parasites specialize
on hosts that can be characterized as predictable resources at a site in
Amazonian Ecuador. We incorporated host phylogenetic relationship and relative
abundance in assessing parasite specialization, and we examined associations
between parasite specialization and three host characteristics - abundance, mass 
and longevity - using quantile regression, phylogenetic logistic regression and
t-tests. Hosts of specialist malaria parasite lineages were on average more
abundant than hosts of generalist parasite lineages, but the relationship between
host abundance and parasite specialization was not consistent across analyses. We
also found support for a positive association between parasite specialization and
host longevity, but this also was not consistent across analyses. Nonetheless,
our findings suggest that the predictability of a host resource may play a role
in the evolution of specialization. However, we also discuss two alternative
explanations to the resource predictability hypothesis for specialization: (i)
that interspecific interactions among the parasites themselves might constrain
some parasites to a specialist strategy, and (ii) that frequent encounters with
multiple host species, mediated by blood-sucking insects, might promote
generalization within this system.

BACKGROUND: Insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) are highly effective in reducing 
malaria burden when used properly. However, factors related to individuals,
households and community may influence how ITNs are used for malaria control. The
study examined influences exerted at these levels to determine if they are
associated with ITN non-use among children under 5 years of age in Rwanda.
METHODS: Using data from the 2010 Rwanda Demographic Health Survey, the
investigation was done on the factors associated with ITN non-use among children 
under 5 years. Descriptive statistics as well as univariate and multilevel
logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with ITN
non-use.
RESULTS: Responses from a total of 6173 women aged 15-49 years living in 492
villages were included in the analysis. Risk factors for children not utilizing
ITNs (25 %) included: (Odds ratio [95 % confidence interval]) households with
more than five members (1.42 [1.23-1.63]), employed mother (1.33 [1.06-1.66]),
and lower household altitude (1.36 [1.14-1.61]). Protective risk factors for ITN 
use included households with more than three nets (0.39 [0.33-0.47]), mothers who
attended one to four visits at antenatal clinics during pregnancy (0.45
[0.29-0.69]), more than four antenatal clinic visits during pregnancy (0.39
[0.21-0.70]), mothers married or living with partner (0.43 [0.36-0.52]), mothers 
with any education level (0.77 [0.65-0.91]), and households with higher community
wealth quintile (0.71 [0.59-0.84]).
CONCLUSIONS: Rwanda has achieved high coverage of ITN use and proper use has
contributed to a decline in malaria in Rwanda; however, maintaining universal ITN
coverage is not enough to protect citizens from this disease. Risk factors
related to ITN non-use at individual, household and community level include
poverty, education, birth spacing, and antenatal clinic attendance. There is a
need to address findings with strategies to mitigate the non-use of ITNs for
effective malaria prevention in Rwanda.

We earlier established that nitric oxide (NO) is protective against severe
malaria and that arginine and NO levels are reduced in malaria patients. We now
show that an M2-like blood monocyte phenotype is significantly associated with
hypoargininemia, NO insufficiency, and disease severity in Tanzanian children
with falciparum malaria. Compared to control children (n = 106), children with
moderately severe (n = 77) and severe falciparum malaria (n = 129) had
significantly higher mononuclear cell arginase 1 mRNA, protein, and enzyme
activity; lower NOS2 mRNA; lower plasma arginine; and higher plasma IL-10, IL-13,
and IL-4. In addition, monocyte CD206 and CD163 and plasma soluble CD163 were
elevated. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed a significant
correlation of risk of severe malaria with both plasma IL-10 and soluble CD163
levels. Monocyte M2 skewing likely contributes to NO bioinsufficiency in
falciparum malaria in children. Treatments that reverse the M2 polarization may
have potential as adjunctive treatment for malaria.

BACKGROUND: There is limited information on compliance rates with anti-vectorial 
protective measures (AVPMs) during travel to countries with risk of dengue and
chikungunya. We evaluated differences in mosquito exposures, and factors
associated with AVPM compliance in travellers going to countries where the
principal mosquito-borne infectious disease threat is falciparum malaria and
those where risk of dengue or chikungunya predominates.
METHODS: Department of Defence beneficiaries with planned travel to regions where
the predominant mosquito-borne infection is falciparum malaria, and those with
predominantly dengue or chikungunya risk, were included. Regions were divided
into three groups: 'high-risk falciparum malaria', 'low-risk falciparum malaria' 
and 'chikungunya/dengue risk'. Demographics, trip characteristics, arthropod
exposure and AVPM compliance were captured using pre- and post-travel surveys.
Skin repellent compliance was defined as self-reported use, categorized as
'often/every day'. A logistic regression model was used to estimate factors
associated with AVPM compliance.
RESULTS: 183 (9%), 185 (9%) and 149 (7%) travelled to high and low falciparum
malaria risk regions, and chikungunya/dengue risk regions, respectively. Overall,
53% (95% CI: 48-57%) and 16% (95% CI: 12-19%) were compliant with repellent use
on skin and clothing, respectively. Daytime bites were reported more frequently
in chikungunya/dengue risk regions than high malaria risk regions (37% vs. 10%), 
while night time bites were frequently in high malaria risk regions (53% vs 20%; 
P < 0.001). Compliance with skin repellents was associated with female gender
[RR: 1.54 (95% CI: 1.05-2.28)], observing mosquitoes during travel [RR: 2.77 (95%
CI: 1.76-4.36)] and travel during the rainy season [RR: 2.45 (95% CI:
1.66-3.71)]).
CONCLUSIONS: Poor AVPM compliance was observed in the overall cohort. Compliance 
with skin repellent use was associated with female gender, observing mosquitoes
and travelling during the rainy season, and was not associated with the risk of
malaria or chikungunya/dengue at the travel destination.

BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of
insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) for the prevention of malaria and reduction of
mortality and morbidity from mosquito-borne diseases. Although many countries,
including the Democratic Republic of Congo, have adopted this recommendation and 
distributed bed nets to their inhabitants, the percentage of the population using
ITNs remains low.
METHODS: This study was conducted with 400 mothers with at least one child under 
5 years of age in health zones in the Bandundu province. Face-to-face interviews 
were conducted using structured pre-coded questionnaires. Chi-square tests and
logistic regressions were calculated using the SPSS Version 21.0 software.
RESULTS: Among the studied variables, education status (p = 0.013), marital
status (p = 0.004), ANC utilization (p = 0.13), suffering from malaria during
pregnancy (p = 0.019), and knowledge of the seriousness of malaria (p = 0.013)
were significant determinants of the use of ITNs in logistic regression analyses.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that the regular use of ITNs by
women during pregnancy is associated with marital status, attending ANC services,
and awareness of the serious nature of malaria. Therefore, education about the
risk factors among populations is needed.

BACKGROUND: Encouraging progress has been seen with reductions in Plasmodium
falciparum malaria transmission in some parts of Africa. Reduced transmission
might lead to increasing susceptibility to malaria among older children due to
lower acquired immunity, and this has implications for ongoing control
strategies.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a longitudinal observational study of children
admitted to Kilifi County Hospital in Kenya and linked it to data on residence
and insecticide-treated net (ITN) use. This included data from 69,104 children
aged from 3 mo to 13 y admitted to Kilifi County Hospital between 1 January 1990 
and 31 December 2014. The variation in malaria slide positivity among admissions 
was examined in logistic regression models using the following predictors:
location of the residence, calendar time, the child's age, ITN use, and the
enhanced vegetation index (a proxy for soil moisture). The proportion of malaria 
slide-positive admissions declined from 0.56 (95% confidence interval [CI]
0.54-0.58) in 1998 to 0.07 (95% CI 0.06-0.08) in 2009 but then increased again
through to 0.24 (95% CI 0.22-0.25) in 2014. Older children accounted for most of 
the increase after 2009 (0.035 [95% CI 0.030-0.040] among young children compared
to 0.22 [95% CI 0.21-0.23] in older children). There was a nonlinear relationship
between malaria risk and prevalence of ITN use within a 2 km radius of an
admitted child's residence such that the predicted malaria positive fraction
varied from ~0.4 to <0.1 as the prevalence of ITN use varied from 20% to 80%. In 
this observational analysis, we were unable to determine the cause of the decline
in malaria between 1998 and 2009, which pre-dated the dramatic scale-up in ITN
distribution and use.
CONCLUSION: Following a period of reduced transmission, a cohort of older
children emerged who have increased susceptibility to malaria. Further reductions
in malaria transmission are needed to mitigate the increasing burden among older 
children, and universal ITN coverage is a promising strategy to achieve this
goal.

BACKGROUND: Vitamin A deficiency is the leading cause of preventable visual
impairments in children. It is also an underlying cause for nearly one-fourth of 
global child mortality associated with measles, diarrhea, and malaria. The
limited literature available in Ethiopia shows severe public health significance 
of vitamin-A deficiency. Hence the aim of the current study was to assess the
prevalence and factors determining vitamin-A deficiency among preschool children 
in Dembia District, northwest Ethiopia.
METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among preschool
children of Dembia District from January to February, 2015. A multi-stage
sampling, followed by a systematic sampling technique was employed to select
study participants. A structured interviewer-administered questionnaire was used 
to collect data. Using a binary logistic regression model, multivariable analysis
was fitted to identify the associated factors of vitamin-A deficiency. The
adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with a 95 % confidence interval was computed to assess 
the strength of the association, and variables with a p value of <0.05 in
multivariable analysis were considered as statistically significant.
RESULTS: Six hundred eighty-one preschool children were included in the study,
giving a response rate of 96.5 %. The overall prevalence of xerophthalmia was
8.6 %. The result of the multivariable analysis revealed that nonattendance at
the antenatal care clinic [AOR 2.65,95 % CI (1.39,5.07)], being male [AOR 1.81,
95 % CI (1.01,3.24)], and in the age group of 49-59 months [AOR 3.00, 95 % CI
(1.49,6.02)] were significantly associated with vitamin-A deficiency.
CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin-A deficiency is a severe public health problem in the study 
area. Further strengthening antenatal care utilization and giving emphasis to
preschool children will help to mitigate vitamin-A deficiency in the study area.

MAIN OBJECTIVE: Prompt access to primary healthcare before onset of severe
illness is vital to improve morbidity and mortality rates. The Gambia has high
rates of child mortality and research is needed to investigate contributing
factors further. This study aimed to identify factors affecting access to primary
healthcare for children <5 years (y) in rural Gambia focusing on delayed
presentation and severe illness at presentation as indicators in a setting where 
primary healthcare is delivered free of charge.
METHODS: Data were extracted from an electronic medical records system at a rural
primary healthcare clinic in The Gambia for children (0-5y) between 2009 and
2012. First clinic attendances with malaria, lower respiratory tract infections
(LRTI) and diarrhoeal disease, the main contributors to mortality in this
setting, were identified and categorized as delayed/non-delayed and
severe/non-severe representing our two main outcome measures. Potential
explanatory variables, identified through a comprehensive literature review were 
obtained from an ongoing demographic surveillance system for this population.
Variables associated with either delayed/non-delayed and/or with
severe/non-severe presentations identified by univariate analysis (p<0.1) were
assessed in multivariate models using logistic regression (p<0.05).
RESULTS: Out of 6554 clinic attendances, 571 relevant attendances were
identified. Delayed presentation was common (45% of all presentations) and there 
was a significantly reduced risk associated with being from villages with free
regular access to transport (OR 0.502, 95%CI[0.310, 0.814], p = 0.005). Children 
from villages with free regular transport were also less likely to present with
severe illness (OR 0.557, 95%CI[0.325, 0.954], p = 0.033).
CONCLUSIONS: Transport availability rather than distance to health clinic is an
important barrier to accessing healthcare for children in The Gambia, and public 
health interventions should aim to reduce this barrier.

Malaria is a serious public health threat in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), and its
transmission risk varies geographically. Modelling its geographic characteristics
is essential for identifying the spatial and temporal risk of malaria
transmission. Remote sensing (RS) has been serving as an important tool in
providing and assessing a variety of potential climatic/environmental malaria
transmission variables in diverse areas. This review focuses on the utilization
of RS-driven climatic/environmental variables in determining malaria transmission
in SSA. A systematic search on Google Scholar and the Institute for Scientific
Information (ISI) Web of Knowledge(SM) databases (PubMed, Web of Science and
ScienceDirect) was carried out. We identified thirty-five peer-reviewed articles 
that studied the relationship between remotely-sensed climatic variable(s) and
malaria epidemiological data in the SSA sub-regions. The relationship between
malaria disease and different climatic/environmental proxies was examined using
different statistical methods. Across the SSA sub-region, the normalized
difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from either the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer
(AVHRR) or Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) satellite sensors was
most frequently returned as a statistically-significant variable to model both
spatial and temporal malaria transmission. Furthermore, generalized linear models
(linear regression, logistic regression and Poisson regression) were the most
frequently-employed methods of statistical analysis in determining malaria
transmission predictors in East, Southern and West Africa. By contrast,
multivariate analysis was used in Central Africa. We stress that the utilization 
of RS in determining reliable malaria transmission predictors and
climatic/environmental monitoring variables would require a tailored approach
that will have cognizance of the geographical/climatic setting, the stage of
malaria elimination continuum, the characteristics of the RS variables and the
analytical approach, which in turn, would support the channeling of intervention 
resources sustainably.

BACKGROUND: Most malarious countries outside of Africa are co-endemic for
Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. The comparative burden of anaemia in 
the community caused by these two species is incompletely characterized.
METHODS: A three-stage, cross-sectional, community survey was used to determine
the proportion of moderate or severe anaemia (haemoglobin <7 g/dL) attributable
to patent P. vivax, P. falciparum and mixed parasitaemia in Papua, Indonesia.
Adjusted population-attributable fractions were calculated from multivariable
logistic regression models. Eight hundred and twenty-five households were
surveyed with a total of 5255 occupants, 3890 (74 %) of whom were present and
provided a blood sample. Plasmodium falciparum parasitaemia was present in 8.1 % 
(n = 315) of participants, P. vivax in 6.4 % (n = 250) and mixed infections in
1.9 % (n = 72). Overall, P. falciparum was associated with a mean reduction in
haemoglobin of 1.16 g/dL compared to those without patent parasitaemia [95 %
confidence interval (95 % CI) 0.91, 1.41 g/dL]. The corresponding values for P.
vivax and mixed infections were 0.66 g/dL (95 % CI 0.35, 0.96) and 1.25 g/dL
(0.71, 1.80), respectively. Overall, 16.7 % (95 % CI 8.52, 24.2 %) of haemoglobin
concentrations <7 g/dL in the community were estimated to be attributable to
patent parasitaemia. The fractions for infants and 1-5 years old were 34.4 %
(95 % CI -3.30, 58.3 %) and 23.2 % (95 % CI 3.34, 39.0 %), respectively.
Plasmodium vivax was associated with a greater than threefold higher attributable
fraction of anaemia in infants compared with P. falciparum [27.6 % (95 % CI
-3.20, 49.2 %) versus 7.94 % (-5.87, 20.0 %)].
CONCLUSION: Despite comparatively low-level endemicity, malaria is associated
with a significant proportion of all cases of community anaemia in southern
Papua. Contrary to its benign reputation, P. vivax is an important and
preventable risk factor for anaemia during infancy-a probable consequence of
relapsing disease prior to the development of immunity.

OBJECTIVE: To measure prevalence of prior/current Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium
falciparum (PV and PF), Brucella spp. (BR), dengue virus (DENV), Leishmania
donovani (visceral leishmaniasis; VL), and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF)
virus exposure among Afghan National Army (ANA) recruits.
METHODS: Randomly chosen, nationally representative serum samples from consenting
men aged 18-40 years and who were screened between February 2010 and January 2011
were tested, with ∼25 samples/province. Samples were screened for PV and PF
antigens and VL antibody with rapid diagnostic tests. Reactive malaria screening 
results were confirmed with polymerase chain reaction assay. Enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assays were used to screen for CCHF and DENV antibodies; reactive
DENV samples were confirmed with the plaque-reduction neutralization test. BR
screening and confirmatory testing was performed with slide and tube
agglutination, respectively. Correlates of BR titres >1:80 were analyzed using
logistic regression.
RESULTS: Of 809 participants contributing specimens, 62% had previously lived
outside Afghanistan, predominantly in Pakistan and Iran. CCHF (4.1%, n = 33),
DENV (2.1%, n = 17), and VL (1.0%, n = 8) antibody prevalence was low. For PV and
PF, only 7 out of 56 reactive samples had detectable nucleic acid. For BR, 8.0%
(n = 65) of samples had screening titers >1:40, of which 83.1% had confirmatory
titers >1:80. Participants from Kabul and surrounding provinces had lower odds
(OR = 0.19, 95% CI: 0.04-1.00) of BR antibody compared with other regions.
CONCLUSIONS: BR exposure was relatively common with a nearly national
distribution, whereas geographic distribution for other pathogens aligned roughly
with the expected vector distribution. Public health protection measures should
include vector control, food safety, and enhanced diagnostics for acute febrile
illness.

INTRODUCTION: Intermittent preventive treatment with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine
(IPTp-SP) is recommended for malaria prevention during pregnancy. We investigated
factors associated with the failure of this strategy.
METHODS: We conducted a case-control study in two health care facilities in
Yaounde, from 1 May 2014 to 30 April 2015. Pregnant women treated with IPTp-SP,
hospitalized for malaria and having a positive Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) result
(case-subjects) were compared to pregnant women treated with IPTp-SP having a
negative RDT result (control-subjects). Epi Info 7 software and SPSS 18.0
software were used with P< 0.05 as significance threshold.
RESULTS: We recruited 234 subjects, 109 (46.6%) case-subjects and 125
control-subjects (53.4%). The associated factors found were: prematurity (P=0.03;
OR=1.15; IC= 0.32 - 4.10), the non-use of LLIN (P=0.006; OR= 2.31; IC= 1.26 -
4.25), a history of hospitalization for malaria (P=0.007; OR= 2.19; IC= 1.23 -
3.89), IPTp-SP administration after 28 gestational weeks (P=0.001, OR= 3.55; IC= 
1.7 - 7.61). After logistic regression, prematurity (P=0.024; OR=2.01;
IC=1.1-3.7) and a history of hospitalization for malaria (P=0.001; OR=2.83;
IC=1.50-5.4) remained associated with IPTp-SP failure.
CONCLUSION: A history of hospitalization for malaria and prematurity are
independent predictor of IPTp-SP failure.

OBJECTIVE: This study identified the relationship between interventions with
women's health volunteer groups in two Myanmar villages and maternal and child
health outcomes.
DESIGN AND SAMPLE: This cross-sectional study included 188 women aged 15-49 years
old with at least one ≤5-year-old child. The women were randomly selected from
two control and two experimental villages.
MEASURES: Data were collected via structured interview with a questionnaire based
on the UNICEF Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey.
RESULTS: Logistic regression analyses confirmed that women's health volunteer
group intervention was related to the participants' receiving any antenatal care 
(OR: 6.99, p < .01) and having knowledge regarding danger signs during the
perinatal period (OR: 15.08, p < .001), modern contraceptive methods (OR: 44.52, 
p < .001), acceptable first aid (OR: 14.04, p < .001), and malaria prevention
(OR: 40.30, p < .001). A skilled midwife had the most significant relationship
with patients' receiving any antenatal care (OR: 65.18, p < .001). Distance from 
urban area negatively related to appropriate disposal of the child's stool (i.e.,
flushed in a latrine; OR: 7.51, p < .05).
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that women's health volunteer groups may positively
affect the diffusion of the need to seek antenatal care and health knowledge in
rural Myanmar. The importance of skilled midwives is also highlighted, especially
in resource-limited settings.

Current estimates put the prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in
Kenya at 5-8%. We determined the HBV infection prevalence in the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative Kenyan adult and adolescent population
based on samples collected from a national survey. We analyzed data from
HIV-negative participants in the 2007 Kenya AIDS Indicator Survey to estimate the
HBV infection prevalence. We defined past or present HBV infection as presence of
total hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb), and chronic HBV infection (CHBI) as
presence of both total HBcAb and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). We
calculated crude and adjusted odds of HBV infection by demographic
characteristics and risk factors using logistic regression analyses. Of 1,091
participants aged 15-64 years, approximately 31.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 
= 28.0-35.3%) had exposure to HBV, corresponding to approximately 6.1 million (CI
= 5.4-6.8 million) with past or present HBV infection. The estimated prevalence
of CHBI was 2.1% (95% CI = 1.4-3.1%), corresponding to approximately 398,000 (CI 
= 261,000-602,000) with CHBI. CHBI is a major public health problem in Kenya,
affecting approximately 400,000 persons. Knowing the HBV infection prevalence at 
baseline is important for planning and public health policy decision making and
for monitoring the impact of viral hepatitis prevention programs.

BACKGROUND: Humoral immune responses against proteins of asexual blood-stage
malaria parasites have been associated with clinical immunity. However,
variations in the antibody-driven responses may be associated with a genetic
component of the human host. The objective of the present study was to evaluate
the influence of co-stimulatory molecule gene polymorphisms of the immune system 
on the magnitude of the humoral immune response against a Plasmodium vivax
vaccine candidate antigen.
METHODS: Polymorphisms in the CD28, CTLA4, ICOS, CD40, CD86 and BLYS genes of 178
subjects infected with P. vivax in an endemic area of the Brazilian Amazon were
genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism
(PCR-RFLP). The levels of IgM, total IgG and IgG subclasses specific for ICB2-5, 
i.e., the N-terminal portion of P. vivax merozoite surface protein 1 (PvMSP-1),
were determined by enzyme-linked immuno assay. The associations between the
polymorphisms and the antibody response were assessed by means of logistic
regression models.
RESULTS: After correcting for multiple testing, the IgG1 levels were
significantly higher in individuals recessive for the single nucleotide
polymorphism rs3116496 in CD28 (p = 0.00004). Furthermore, the interaction
between CD28 rs35593994 and BLYS rs9514828 had an influence on the IgM levels
(p = 0.0009).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study support the hypothesis that
polymorphisms in the genes of co-stimulatory components of the immune system can 
contribute to a natural antibody-driven response against P. vivax antigens.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Maternal morbidity and mortality statistics remain
unacceptably high in Malawi. Prominent among the risk factors in the country is
anaemia in pregnancy, which generally results from nutritional inadequacy
(particularly iron deficiency) and malaria, among other factors. This warrants
concerted efforts to increase iron intake among reproductive-age women. This
study, among women in Malawi, examined factors determining intake of supplemental
iron for at least 90 days during pregnancy.
METHODS: A weighted sample of 10,750 women (46.7%), from the 23,020 respondents
of the 2010 Malawi Demographic and Health Survey (MDHS), were utilized for the
study. Univariate, bivariate, and regression techniques were employed. While
univariate analysis revealed the percent distributions of all variables,
bivariate analysis was used to examine the relationships between individual
independent variables and adherence to iron supplementation. Chi-square tests of 
independence were conducted for categorical variables, with the significance
level set at P < 0.05. Two binary logistic regression models were used to
evaluate the net effect of independent variables on iron supplementation
adherence.
RESULTS: Thirty-seven percent of the women adhered to the iron supplementation
recommendations during pregnancy. Multivariate analysis indicated that younger
age, urban residence, higher education, higher wealth status, and attending
antenatal care during the first trimester were significantly associated with
increased odds of taking iron supplementation for 90 days or more during
pregnancy (P < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate low adherence to the World Health
Organization's iron supplementation recommendations among pregnant women in
Malawi, and this contributes to negative health outcomes for both mothers and
children. Focusing on education interventions that target populations with low
rates of iron supplement intake, including campaigns to increase the number of
women who attend antenatal care clinics in the first trimester, are recommended
to increase adherence to iron supplementation recommendations.

BACKGROUND: Numerous countries around the world are approaching malaria
elimination. Until global eradication is achieved, countries that successfully
eliminate the disease will contend with parasite reintroduction through
international movement of infected people. Human-mediated parasite mobility is
also important within countries near elimination, as it drives parasite flows
that affect disease transmission on a subnational scale.
METHODS: Movement patterns exhibited in census-based migration data are compared 
with patterns exhibited in a mobile phone data set from Haiti to quantify how
well migration data predict short-term movement patterns. Because short-term
movement data were unavailable for Mesoamerica, a logistic regression model fit
to migration data from three countries in Mesoamerica is used to predict flows of
infected people between subnational administrative units throughout the region.
RESULTS: Population flows predicted using census-based migration data correlated 
strongly with mobile phone-derived movements when used as a measure of relative
connectivity. Relative population flows are therefore predicted using census data
across Mesoamerica, informing the areas that are likely exporters and importers
of infected people. Relative population flows are used to identify community
structure, useful for coordinating interventions and elimination efforts to
minimize importation risk. Finally, the ability of census microdata inform future
intervention planning is discussed in a country-specific setting using Costa Rica
as an example.
CONCLUSIONS: These results show long-term migration data can effectively predict 
the relative flows of infected people to direct malaria elimination policy, a
particularly relevant result because migration data are generally easier to
obtain than short-term movement data such as mobile phone records. Further,
predicted relative flows highlight policy-relevant population dynamics, such as
major exporters across the region, and Nicaragua and Costa Rica's strong
connection by movement of infected people, suggesting close coordination of their
elimination efforts. Country-specific applications are discussed as well, such as
predicting areas at relatively high risk of importation, which could inform
surveillance and treatment strategies.

BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum merozoite antigens elicit antibody responses in
malaria-endemic populations, some of which are clinically protective, which is
one of the reasons why merozoite antigens are the focus of malaria vaccine
development efforts. Polymorphisms in several merozoite antigen-encoding genes
are thought to arise as a result of selection by the human immune system.
METHODS: The allele frequency distribution of 15 merozoite antigens over a
two-year period, 2007 and 2008, was examined in parasites obtained from children 
with uncomplicated malaria. In the same population, allele frequency changes pre-
and post-anti-malarial treatment were also examined. Any gene which showed a
significant shift in allele frequencies was also assessed longitudinally in
asymptomatic and complicated malaria infections.
RESULTS: Fluctuating allele frequencies were identified in codons 147 and 148 of 
reticulocyte-binding homologue (Rh) 5, with a shift from HD to YH haplotypes over
the two-year period in uncomplicated malaria infections. However, in both the
asymptomatic and complicated malaria infections YH was the dominant and stable
haplotype over the two-year and ten-year periods, respectively. A logistic
regression analysis of all three malaria infection populations between 2007 and
2009 revealed, that the chance of being infected with the HD haplotype decreased 
with time from 2007 to 2009 and increased in the uncomplicated and asymptomatic
infections.
CONCLUSION: Rh5 codons 147 and 148 showed heterogeneity at both an individual and
population level and may be under some degree of immune selection.

BACKGROUND: Malaria in pregnancy (MIP) has serious consequences for the woman,
unborn child and newborn. The use of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine for the
intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy (SP-IPTp) is low in
malaria endemic areas, including some regions of Nigeria. However, little is
known about pregnant women's compliance with the SP-IPTp national guidelines in
primary health care (PHC) facilities in the south-south region of Nigeria. The
aim of this study was to identify the barriers to and determinants of the use of 
SP-IPTp among pregnant women attending ANC in PHC facilities in Cross River
State, south-south region of Nigeria.
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2011 among 400 ANC attendees
aged 15-49 years recruited through multistage sampling. Binary logistic
regression was used to determine the factors associated with the use of SP-IPTp
in the study population.
RESULTS: Use of SP-IPTp was self-reported by 41% of the total respondents. Lack
of autonomy in the households to receive sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) during
ANC was the main barrier to use of IPTp (83%). Other barriers were stock-outs of 
free SP (33%) and poor supervision of SP ingestion by directly observed treatment
among those who obtained SP from ANC clinics (36/110 = 33%). In the multivariate 
logistic regression, the odds of using SP-IPTp was increased by the knowledge of 
the use of insecticide treated nets (ITNs) (OR = 2.13, 95% CI: 1.70-3.73) and SP 
(OR = 22.13, 95% CI: 8.10-43.20) for the prevention of MIP. Use of ITNs also
increased the odds of using SP-IPTp (OR = 2.38, 95% CI: 1.24-12.31).
CONCLUSIONS: Use of SP-IPTp was low and was associated with knowledge of the use 
of ITNs and SP as well as the use of ITNs for the prevention of MIP. There is a
need to strengthen PHC systems and address barriers to the usage of SP-IPTp in
order to reduce the burden of MIP.

BACKGROUND: The indigenous Batwa of southwestern Uganda are among the most highly
impoverished populations in Uganda, yet there is negligible research on the
prevalence of malaria in this population. Plasmodium falciparum malaria
parasitaemia prevalence was estimated in an indigenous Batwa and a non-indigenous
neighbouring population, and an exploration of modifiable risk factors was
carried out to identify potential entry points for intervention. Additionally,
evidence of zooprophylaxis was assessed, hypothesizing that livestock ownership
may play a role in malaria risk.
METHODS: Two cross-sectional surveys of Batwa and non-Batwa communities were
carried out in Kanungu District, Uganda in July 2013 and April 2014 based on a
census of adult Batwa and a two-stage systematic random sample of adult non-Batwa
in ten Local Councils where Batwa settlements are located. A community-based
questionnaire and antigen rapid diagnostic test for P. falciparum were carried
out in the cross-sectional health surveys. A multivariable logistic regression
model was built to identify risk factors associated with positive malaria
diagnostic test. A subset analysis of livestock owners tested for zooprophylaxis.
RESULTS: Batwa experienced higher prevalence of malaria parasitaemia than
non-Batwa (9.35 versus 4.45 %, respectively) with over twice the odds of
infection (OR 2.21, 95 % CI 1.23-3.98). Extreme poverty (OR 1.96, 95 % CI
0.98-3.94) and having an iron sheet roof (OR 2.54, 95 % CI 0.96-6.72) increased
the odds of infection in both Batwa and non-Batwa. Controlling for ethnicity,
wealth, and bed net ownership, keeping animals inside the home at night decreased
the odds of parasitaemia among livestock owners (OR 0.29, 95 % CI 0.09-0.94).
CONCLUSION: A health disparity exists between indigenous Batwa and non-indigenous
community members with Batwa having higher prevalence of malaria relative to
non-Batwa. Poverty was associated with increased odds of malaria infection for
both groups. Findings suggest that open eaves and gaps in housing materials
associated with iron sheet roofing represent a modifiable risk factor for
malaria, and may facilitate mosquito house entry; larger sample sizes will be
required to confirm this finding. Evidence for possible zooprophylaxis was
observed among livestock owners in this population for those who sheltered
animals inside the home at night.

Major efforts for malaria prevention programs have gone into scaling up ownership
and use of insecticidal mosquito nets, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa where
the malaria burden is high. Socioeconomic inequities in access to long lasting
insecticidal nets (LLINs) are reduced with free distributions of nets. However,
the relationship between social factors and retention of nets after a free
distribution has been less studied, particularly using a longitudinal approach.
Our research aimed to estimate the ownership and use of LLINs, and examine the
determinants of LLIN retention, within an Indigenous Batwa population after a
free LLIN distribution. Two LLINs were given free of charge to each Batwa
household in Kanungu District, Uganda in November 2012. Surveyors collected data 
on LLIN ownership and use through six cross-sectional surveys pre- and
post-distribution. Household retention, within household access, and individual
use of LLINs were assessed over an 18-month period. Socioeconomic determinants of
household retention of LLINs post-distribution were modelled longitudinally using
logistic regression with random effects. Direct house-to-house distribution of
free LLINs did not result in sustainable increases in the ownership and use of
LLINs. Three months post-distribution, only 73% of households owned at least one 
LLIN and this period also saw the greatest reduction in ownership compared to
other study periods. Eighteen-months post distribution, only a third of
households still owned a LLIN. Self-reported age-specific use of LLINs was
generally higher for children under five, declined for children aged 6-12, and
was highest for older adults aged over 35. In the model, household wealth was a
significant predictor of LLIN retention, controlling for time and other
variables. This research highlights on-going socioeconomic inequities in access
to malaria prevention measures among the Batwa in southwestern Uganda, even after
free distribution of LLINs, and provides critical information to inform local
malaria programs on possible intervention entry-points to increase access and use
among this marginalized population.

Mobile Phone Short Message Service to Improve Malaria Pharmacoadherence in
Zambia.

FL, USA.

PURPOSE: The current malaria treatment in Zambia is more than 97% effective when 
the regimen is strictly adhered to. However, the mean adherence rate in
sub-Saharan Africa is only 38% to 48%. Poor pharmacoadherence remains a
significant barrier to malaria control and elimination. The purpose of this study
was to determine if adherence rates to a six-dose artemesinin-based combination
therapy (ACT) treatment differ between patients who received short message
service (SMS) reminders and those who did not. This is the first study of its
kind using SMS directly to the patient for ACT adherence in sub-Saharan Africa.
DESIGN: An experimental, randomized controlled trial was conducted through a
sample of 96 adult malaria patients at Fisenge Clinic in Zambia in 2014.
METHODS: The intervention group received SMS messages to remind them to take
their medication according to the prescribed regimen. An electronic pillbox was
used to measure pharmacoadherence for both groups, and patients were classified
as probably adherent or probably nonadherent.
FINDINGS: Data were analyzed using chi-square for association between the SMS
intervention and pharmacoadherence, and logistic regression was used for
predictors of adherence. No significant association was found between SMS
reminders and pharmacoadherence (χ(2) = 0.19, df = 1, p = .67). Binary logistic
regression indicated that there were no variables associated with adherence (p > 
.05).
CONCLUSIONS: SMS reminder messages did not appear to improve pharmacoadherence in
malaria medication.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The study indicates few implications to nursing practice due 
to the lack of association between SMS and adherence, but adds to current
knowledge.

BACKGROUND: Mosquito habitat-association studies are an important basis for
disease control programmes and/or vector distribution models. However, studies do
not explicitly account for incomplete detection during larval presence and
abundance surveys, with potential for significant biases because of environmental
influences on larval behaviour and sampling efficiency.
METHODS: Data were used from a dip-sampling study for Anopheles larvae in
Ethiopia to evaluate the effect of six factors previously associated with larval 
sampling (riparian vegetation, direct sunshine, algae, water depth, pH and
temperature) on larval presence and detectability. Comparisons were made between:
(i) a presence-absence logistic regression where samples were pooled at the site 
level and detectability ignored, (ii) a success versus trials binomial model, and
(iii) a presence-detection mixture model that separately estimated presence and
detection, and fitted different explanatory variables to these estimations.
RESULTS: Riparian vegetation was consistently highlighted as important, strongly 
suggesting it explains larval presence (-). However, depending on how larval
detectability was estimated, the other factors showed large variations in their
statistical importance. The presence-detection mixture model provided strong
evidence that larval detectability was influenced by sunshine and water
temperature (+), with weaker evidence for algae (+) and water depth (-). For
larval presence, there was also some evidence that water depth (-) and pH (+)
influenced site occupation. The number of dip-samples needed to determine if
larvae were likely present at a site was condition dependent: with sunshine and
warm water requiring only two dips, while cooler water and cloud cover required
11.
CONCLUSIONS: Environmental factors influence true larval presence and larval
detectability differentially when sampling in field conditions. Researchers need 
to be more aware of the limitations and possible biases in different analytical
approaches used to associate larval presence or abundance with local
environmental conditions. These effects can be disentangled using data that are
routinely collected (i.e., multiple dip samples at each site) by employing a
modelling approach that separates presence from detectability.

BACKGROUND: Despite a remarkable decline in morbidity and mortality since the era
of malaria roll back strategy, it still poses a huge challenge in Ethiopia in
general and in Hadiya Zone in particular. Although, there are data from routine
health management information on few indicators, there is scarcity of data
showing magnitude of malaria and associated factors including knowledge and
practice in the study area. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess
magnitude and factors affecting malaria in low transmission areas among febrile
cases attending public health facilities in Hadiya Zone, Ethiopia.
METHODS: A facility based cross-sectional study was conducted in Hadiya Zone from
May 15 to June 15, 2014. Simple random sampling was used to select the health
facility while systematic random sampling technique was used to reach febrile
patients attending public health facilities. Data were collected by a pre-tested 
structured questionnaire containing sections of socio demographic risk factors
and knowledge and prevention practices of malaria. Data were entered to Epi-Info 
software version 3.5.4 and exported to SPSS version 16 for descriptive and
logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: One hundred six (25.8%) of participating febrile patients attending at
sampled health facilities were found to have malaria by microscopy. Of which,
P.vivax, P.falciparum and mixed infection accounted for 76(71. 7%), 27 (25.5%)
and 3 (2.8%), respectively. History of travel to malaria endemic area, [AOR:
2.59, 95% CI: (1.24, 5.38)], not using bed net, [AOR: 4.67, 95%CI:, (2.11,
10.37)], poor practice related to malaria prevention and control, [AOR: 2.28,
(95%CI: (1.10, 4.74)], poor knowledge about malaria, [AOR: 5.09,95%CI:
(2.26,11.50)] and estimated distance of stagnant water near to the residence,
[AOR: 3.32, (95%CI: (1.13, 9.76)] were significantly associated factors of
malaria positivity in the study.
CONCLUSION: The present study revealed that malaria is still a major source of
morbidity in the study area among febrile illnesses. Poor level of knowledge,
poor prevention practices, not using bed net, travel history to endemic areas and
residing near stagnant water were associated factors with malaria positivity in
the study area. Therefore, implementers, policy makers and stakeholders should
strengthen the services provided by the community health development army, health
extension service and health facilities services focusing on increasing malaria
intervention coverage and mobilization of information, education and
communication to increase knowledge about malaria transmission, prevention and
control practices.

BACKGROUND: Afghan refugees in northern Pakistan have been resident for over
30 years and current information on malaria in this population is sparse.
Understanding malaria risk and distribution in refugee camps is important for
effective management both in camps and on return to Afghanistan.
METHODS: Cross-sectional malariometric surveys were conducted in five Afghan
refugee camps to determine infection and exposure to both Plasmodium falciparum
and Plasmodium vivax. Factors associated with malaria infection and exposure were
analysed using logistic regression, and spatial heterogeneity within camps was
investigated with SatScan.
RESULTS: In this low-transmission setting, prevalence of infection in the five
camps ranged from 0-0.2 to 0.4-9 % by rapid diagnostic test and 0-1.39 and 5-15 %
by polymerase chain reaction for P. falciparum and P. vivax, respectively.
Prevalence of anti-malarial antibodies to P. falciparum antigens was 3-11 and
17-45 % for P. vivax antigens. Significant foci of P. vivax infection and
exposure were detected in three of the five camps. Hotspots of P. falciparum were
also detected in three camps, only one of which also showed evidence of P. vivax 
hotspots.
CONCLUSIONS: There is low and spatially heterogeneous malaria transmission in the
refugee camps in northern Pakistan. Understanding malaria risk in refugee camps
is important so the malaria risk faced by these populations in the camps and upon
their return to Afghanistan can be effectively managed.

In Zimbabwe, more than half of malaria cases are concentrated in Manicaland
Province, where seasonal malaria epidemics occur despite intensified control
strategies. The objectives of this study were to develop a prediction model based
on environmental risk factors and obtain seasonal malaria risk maps for Mutasa
District, one of the worst affected districts in Manicaland Province. From
October 2012 to September 2015, 483 households were surveyed, and 104 individuals
residing within 69 households had positive rapid diagnostic test results.
Logistic regression was used to model the probability of household positivity as 
a function of the environmental covariates extracted from high-resolution remote 
sensing data sources. Model predictions and prediction standard errors were
generated for the rainy and dry seasons. The resulting maps predicted elevated
risk during the rainy season, particularly in low-lying areas bordering
Mozambique. In contrast, the risk of malaria was low across the study area during
the dry season with foci of malaria risk scattered along the northern and western
peripheries of the study area. These findings underscore the need for strong
cross-border malaria control initiatives to complement country-specific
interventions.

Malaria constitutes a major public health problem in Zimbabwe, particularly in
the north and east bordering Zambia and Mozambique. In Manicaland Province in
eastern Zimbabwe, malaria transmission is seasonal and unstable. Over the past
decade, Manicaland Province has reported increased malaria transmission due to
limited funding, drug resistance and insecticide resistance. The aim of this
study was to identify risk factors at the individual and household levels to
better understand the epidemiology of malaria and guide malaria control
strategies in eastern Zimbabwe. Between October 2012 and September 2014,
individual demographic data and household characteristics were collected from
cross-sectional surveys of 1,116 individuals residing in 316 households in Mutasa
District, one of the worst affected districts. Factors associated with malaria,
measured by rapid diagnostic test (RDT), were identified through multilevel
logistic regression models. A total of 74 participants were RDT positive.
Sleeping under a bed net had a protective effect against malaria despite
pyrethroid resistance in the mosquito vector. Multivariate analysis showed that
malaria risk was higher among individuals younger than 25 years, residing in
households located at a lower household density and in closer proximity to the
Mozambique border. The risk factors identified need to be considered in targeting
malaria control interventions to reduce host-vector interactions.

BACKGROUND: From 2007 to 2013, intensive control measures reduced malaria burden 
by 90 % along the China-Myanmar border. However, despite these measures a P.
falciparum malaria outbreak was reported in the Shan Special Region II of Myanmar
in June of 2014.
METHODS: Epidemiological, parasitological and entomological investigations were
performed. Dihydroartemisinin piperaquine (DAPQ) was immediately administered to 
treat parasite positive individuals. Long lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN),
indoor residual spraying (IRS) with insecticides and behavior change
communication (BCC) were also provided for outbreak control. An embedded efficacy
study was conducted evaluating DP. Molecular genotyping via polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) was performed on the Kelch gene on chromosome 13.
RESULTS: All infections were identified as Plasmodium falciparum by RDT and
microscopy. Two fatalities resulted from the outbreak. The attack rate was 72.8 %
(67/92) and the incidence density rate was 14.2 per 100 person-weeks. The
positive rate of rapid diagnostic test (RDT) was 72.2 % (65/90) and
microscopically-determine parasite rate 42.2 % (38/90). Adjusted odds ratio (OR) 
of multivariate logistic regression analysis for aged <15 years, 15-45 years,
inappropriate treatment from a private healer and lack of bed nets were 13.51 (95
% confidence interval, 2.21-105.89), 7.75 (1.48-44.97), 3.78 (1.30-46.18) and
3.21(1.21-15.19) respectively. In the six surrounding communities of the outbreak
site, positive RDT rate was 1.2 % (4/328) and microscopically-determine parasite 
rate 0.6 % (2/328). Two light traps collected a total of 110 anopheline
mosquitoes including local vectors, An. minimus, An. sinensis and An. maculates. 
After intensive control, the detection of malaria attacks, parasites and antigen 
were reduced to zero between July 1 and December 1, 2014. The cure rate of P.
falciparum patients at day 42 was 94.3 % (95 % CI, 80.8-99.3 %). The PCR did not 
detect K13-propeller mutations.
CONCLUSION: Imported P. falciparum caused the outbreak. Age, seeking
inappropriate treatment and lack of bed nets were risk factors for infection
during the outbreak. P. falciparum was sensitive to treatment with DAPQ. The
integrated measures controlled the outbreak and prevented the spread of P.
falciparum effectively. The results of this study indicate that malaria control
on the China-Myanmar border, especially among special populations, needs further 
collaboration between China, Myanmar and international societies.

BACKGROUND: In order to understand factors influencing fever/malaria management
practices among community-based individuals, the study evaluated psychosocial,
socio-demographic and environmental determinants of prompt and adequate
healthcare-seeking behaviours.
METHODS: A quantitative household (HH) survey was conducted from December 2014 to
February 2015 in Ruhuha sector, Bugesera district in the Eastern province of
Rwanda. HHs that reported having had at least one member who experienced a fever 
and/or malaria episode in the previous 3 months prior to the study were included 
in the analysis. Healthcare-seeking behaviours associated with the last episode
of illness were analysed. Socio-demographic, health facility access, long-lasting
insecticidal-treated nets (LLINs), data on malaria knowledge, data and theory of 
planned behaviour (TPB) related variables (attitudes, subjective norms, perceived
behavioural control) with regard to fever/malaria healthcare seeking, were
collected. The primary outcome was prompt and adequate care defined as: (1)
seeking advice or treatment at a health facility (health centre or hospital) or
from a community health worker (CHW); (2) advice or treatment seeking within
same/next day of symptoms onset; (3) received a laboratory diagnosis; (4)
received advice or treatment; and, (5) reported completing the prescribed dose of
medication. Determinants of prompt and adequate care among presumed malaria cases
were evaluated using a logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: Overall, 302 (21 %) of the 1410 interviewed HHs reported at least one
member as having experienced a fever or malaria within the 3 months prior to the 
survey. The number of HHs (where at least one member reported fever/malaria) that
reported seeking advice or treatment at a health facility (health centre or
hospital) or from a CHW was 249 (82.4 %). Of those who sought advice or
treatment, 87.3 % had done so on same/next day of symptoms developing, 82.8 %
received a laboratory diagnosis, and more than 90 % who received treatment
reported completing the prescribed dosage. Prompt and adequate care was reported 
from 162 of the 302 HHs (53.6 %) that experienced fever or malaria for one or
more HH members. Bivariate analyses showed that head of household (HoH)-related
characteristics including reported knowledge of three or more malaria symptoms,
having health insurance, being able to pay for medical services, use of LLINs the
night before the survey, having a positive attitude, perceiving social support,
as well as a high-perceived behavioural control with regard to healthcare
seeking, were all significantly associated with prompt and adequate care. In the 
final logistic regression model, a high-perceived behavioural control (odds ratio
(OR) 5.068, p = 0.042), having a health insurance (OR 2.410, p = 0.044) and
having knowledge of malaria symptoms (OR 1.654, p = 0.049) significantly
predicted prompt and adequate care.
CONCLUSIONS: To promote prompt and adequate care seeking for malaria in the area,
particular emphasis should be placed on community-focused strategies that promote
early malaria symptom recognition, increased health insurance coverage and
enhanced perceived behavioural control with regard to healthcare-seeking.

BACKGROUND: Chronic malaria is usually defined as a long-term malarial infection 
in semi-immune subjects, usually without fever or other acute symptoms. The
untreated infection may evolve to hyper-reactive malarial splenomegaly (HMS), a
life-threatening complication. This paper describes the largest series of HMS
ever observed outside endemic countries, and the clinical outcome after a single 
anti-malarial treatment. Contrarily to most authors, still reporting the
traditional, long-term treatment, regardless possible further exposure, the
patients in this series did not receive any further prophylaxis if they were not 
re-exposed to malaria infection.
METHODS: A retrospective, longitudinal study, describing all patients with HMS
diagnosed at the Centre for Tropical Diseases of Negrar, Verona, took place over 
a 25-year period. HMS was defined by a longitudinal spleen diameter ≥16 cm,
IgM ≥ 2.5 g/L, anti-malarial antibody titre ≥160, exclusion of other causes of
splenomegaly. The short-term (≤6 months) clinical outcome after a single
anti-malarial treatment was analysed and so was the long-term outcome of subjects
re-exposed to malaria and submitted or not to anti-malarial prophylaxis or
intermittent treatment. The association of the outcome with the main independent 
variables was first assessed with univariate analysis. Logistic regression was
also performed.
RESULTS: Forty-four subjects with HMS were retrieved. Of those with a short-term 
follow-up visit (<6 months, median 43 days) available before returning to endemic
areas, 20/22 resulted improved/cured, two were unchanged. Of 22 expatriates seen 
at long-term follow-up after re-exposure, 18 were improved/cured, including eight
out of nine who had followed an anti-malarial prophylaxis and 10/13 who had opted
for the alternative of an intermittent treatment.
CONCLUSION: HMS is the most severe form of chronic malaria. A single
anti-malarial treatment is probably adequate to treat HMS in the absence of
re-exposure, while an adequate prophylaxis is necessary for patients exposed
again to malaria transmission. Intermittent treatment would probably be the only 
viable approach in endemic countries.

BACKGROUND: Malaria transmission in Mali is seasonal and peaks at the end of the 
rainy season in October. This study assessed the seasonal variations in the
epidemiology of malaria among children under 10 years of age living in two
villages in Selingué: Carrière, located along the Sankarani River but distant
from the hydroelectric dam, and Binko, near irrigated rice fields, close to the
dam. The aim of this study was to provide baseline data, seasonal pattern and age
distribution of malaria incidence in two sites situated close to a lake in
Selingué.
METHODS: Geographically, Selingué area is located in the basin of Sakanrani and
belongs to the district of Yanfolila in the third administrative region of Mali, 
Sikasso. Two cross-sectional surveys were conducted in October 2010 (end of
transmission season) and in July 2011 (beginning of transmission season) to
determine the point prevalence of asymptomatic parasitaemia, and anaemia among
the children. Cumulative incidence of malaria per month was determined in a
cohort of 549 children through active and passive case detection from November
2010 through October 2011. The number of clinical episodes per year was
determined among the children in the cohort. Logistic regression was used to
determine risk factors for malaria.
RESULTS: The prevalence of malaria parasitaemia varied significantly between
villages with a strong seasonality in Carrière (52.0-18.9 % in October 2010 and
July 2011, respectively) compared with Binko (29.8-23.8 % in October 2010 and
July 2011, respectively). Children 6-9 years old were at least twice more likely 
to carry parasites than children up to 5 years old. For malaria incidence,
64.8-71.9 % of all children experienced at least one episode of clinical malaria 
in Binko and Carrière, respectively. The peak incidence was observed between
August and October (end of the rainy season), but the incidence remained high
until December. Surprisingly, the risk of clinical malaria was two- to nine-fold 
higher among children 5-9 years old compared to younger children.
CONCLUSIONS: A shift in the peak of clinical episodes from children under
5-9 years of age calls for expanding control interventions, such as seasonal
malaria chemoprophylaxis targeting the peak transmission months.

BACKGROUND: Challenges persist in ensuring access to and optimal use of
long-lasting, insecticidal bed nets (LLINs). Factors associated with ownership
and use may differ depending on the history of malaria and prevention control
efforts in a specific region. Understanding how the cultural and
social-environmental context of bed net use may differ between high- and low-risk
regions is important when identifying solutions to improve uptake and appropriate
use.
METHODS: Community forums and a household, cross-sectional survey were used to
collect information on factors related to bed net ownership and use in western
Kenya. Sites with disparate levels of transmission were selected, including an
endemic lowland area, Miwani, and a highland epidemic-prone area, Kapkangani.
Analysis of ownership was stratified by site. A combined site analysis was
conducted to examine factors associated with use of all available bed nets.
Logistic regression modelling was used to determine factors associated with
ownership and use of owned bed nets.
RESULTS: Access to bed nets as the leading barrier to their use was identified in
community forums and cross-sectional surveys. While disuse of available bed nets 
was discussed in the forums, it was a relatively rare occurrence in both sites.
Factors associated with ownership varied by site. Education, perceived risk of
malaria and knowledge of individuals who had died of malaria were associated with
higher bed net ownership in the highlands, while in the lowlands individuals
reporting it was easy to get a bed net were more likely to own one. A combined
site analysis indicated that not using an available bed net was associated with
the attitudes that taking malaria drugs is easier than using a bed net and that
use of a bed net will not prevent malaria. In addition, individuals with an
unused bed net in the household were more likely to indicate that bed nets are
difficult to use, that purchased bed nets are better than freely distributed
ones, and that bed nets should only be used during the rainy season.
CONCLUSION: Variations in factors associated with ownership should be
acknowledged when constructing messaging and distribution campaigns. Despite
reports of bed nets being used for other purposes, those in the home were rarely 
unused in these communities. Disuse seemed to be related to beliefs that can be
addressed through education programmes. As mass distributions continue to take
place, additional research is needed to determine if factors associated with LLIN
ownership and use change with increasing availability of LLIN.

BACKGROUND: Despite being one of the world's most affected regions, only little
is known about the social and spatial distributions of malaria in Indonesian
Papua. Existing studies tend to be descriptive in nature; their inferences are
prone to confounding and selection biases. At the same time, there remains
limited malaria-cartographic activity in the region. Analysing a subset (N =
22,643) of the National Basic Health Research 2007 dataset (N = 987,205), this
paper aims to quantify the district-specific risk of malaria in Papua and to
understand how socio-demographic/economic factors measured at individual and
district levels are associated with individual's probability of contracting the
disease.
METHODS: We adopt a Bayesian hierarchical logistic regression model that
accommodates not only the nesting of individuals within the island's 27
administrative units but also the spatial autocorrelation among these locations. 
Both individual and contextual characteristics are included as predictors in the 
model; a normal conditional autoregressive prior and an exchangeable one are
assigned to the random effects. Robustness is then assessed through sensitivity
analyses using alternative hyperpriors.
RESULTS: We find that rural Papuans as well as those who live in poor, densely
forested, lowland districts are at a higher risk of infection than their
counterparts. We also find age and gender differentials in malaria prevalence, if
only to a small degree. Nine districts are estimated to have higher-than-expected
malaria risks; the extent of spatial variation on the island remains notable even
after accounting for socio-demographic/economic risk factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Although we show that malaria is geography-dependent in Indonesian
Papua, it is also a disease of poverty. This means that malaria eradication
requires not only biological (proximal) interventions but also social (distal)
ones.

BACKGROUND: Malaria remains a major threat to some 3.2 billion persons globally. 
Malaria contributes heavily to the overall disease burden in Mozambique and is
considered endemic. A cornerstone of Mozambique's vector control strategy has
been to strive for universal coverage of insecticide-treated nets (ITN).
METHODS: The study is a population-based cross-sectional survey of female
heads-of-household in Zambézia Province, Mozambique conducted during
August-September, 2010 and April-May, 2014. Analyses accounted for a stratified
two-stage cluster sample design. Outcomes of interest included sleeping under a
mosquito net during the previous night. Descriptive statistics were calculated
for three oversampled districts and for the entire province. Multivariable
logistic regression analysis was used to estimate factors associated with both
changes over time and increased mosquito bed net usage.
RESULTS: Of the 3916 households interviewed in 2010 and 3906 households in 2014, 
64.3% were in possession of at least one mosquito bed net. A higher proportion of
households in Namacurra (90%) reported possession of a mosquito net, compared to 
Alto Molócuè (77%) and Morrumbala (34%), respectively in 2014. Of pregnant
respondents, 58.6% reported sleeping under a mosquito net the previous night in
2010 compared to 68.4% in 2014. Fifty percent of children 0-59 months slept under
a mosquito net the previous night in 2010 compared to 60% in 2014. Factors
associated with use of a mosquito net for female head-of-household respondents
were higher education, understanding Portuguese, larger household size, having
electricity in the household, and larger household monthly income. As travel time
to a health facility increased (per 1 h), respondents had 13% lower odds of
sleeping under a mosquito net (OR 0.87; 95% CI 0.74-1.01, p = 0.07). Pregnant
women in 2014 had a 2.4 times higher odds of sleeping under a bed net if they
lived in Namacurra compared to Alto Molócuè (95% CI 0.91-6.32, p = 0.002 for
district). Higher maternal education, living in Namacurra, and acquisition of
mosquito bed nets were associated with a child 0-59 months reporting sleeping
under the net in the previous night in 2014.
CONCLUSIONS: Intensified focus on the poorest, least educated, and most distant
from health services is needed to improve equity of ITN availability and usage.
Additionally, while some districts have already surpassed goals in terms of
coverage and utilization of ITN, renewed emphasis should be placed on bringing
all geographic regions of the province closer to meeting these targets.

There are limited data on gametocytaemia risk factors before/after treatment with
artemisinin combination therapy in children from areas with transmission of
multiple Plasmodium species. We utilised data from a randomised trial comparing
artemether-lumefantrine (AL) and artemisinin-naphthoquine (AN) in 230 Papua New
Guinean children aged 0.5-5 years with uncomplicated malaria in whom determinants
of gametocytaemia by light microscopy were assessed at baseline using logistic
regression and during follow-up using multilevel mixed effects modelling.
Seventy-four (32%) and 18 (8%) children presented with P. falciparum and P. vivax
gametocytaemia, respectively. Baseline P. falciparum gametocytaemia was
associated with Hackett spleen grade 1 (odds ratio (95% CI) 4.01 (1.60-10.05) vs 
grade 0; P<0.001) and haemoglobin (0.95 (0.92-0.97) per 1g/L increase; P<0.001), 
and P. falciparum asexual parasitaemia in slide-positive cases (0.36 (0.19-0.68) 
for a 10-fold increase; P=0.002). Baseline P. vivax gametocytaemia was associated
with Hackett grade 2 (12.66 (1.31-122.56); P=0.028), mixed P. falciparum/vivax
infection (0.16 (0.03-1.00); P=0.050), P. vivax asexual parasitaemia (5.68
(0.98-33.04); P=0.053) and haemoglobin (0.94 (0.88-1.00); P=0.056). For
post-treatment P. falciparum gametocytaemia, independent predictors were AN vs AL
treatment (4.09 (1.43-11.65)), haemoglobin (0.95 (0.93-0.97)), presence/absence
of P. falciparum asexual forms (3.40 (1.66-0.68)) and day post-treatment (0.086
(0.82-0.90)) (P<0.001). Post-treatment P. vivax gametocytaemia was predicted by
presence of P. vivax asexual forms (596 (12-28,433); P<0.001). Consistent with
slow P. falciparum gametocyte maturation, low haemoglobin, low asexual parasite
density and higher spleen grading, markers of increased prior infection
exposure/immunity, were strong associates of pre-treatment gametocyte positivity.
The persistent inverse association between P. falciparum gametocytaemia and
haemoglobin during follow-up suggests an important role for bone marrow
modulation of gametocytogenesis. In P. vivax infections, baseline and
post-treatment gametocyte carriage was positively related to the acute parasite
burden, reflecting the close association between the development of asexual and
sexual forms.

BACKGROUND: Outbreaks of vector-borne diseases (VBDs) such as dengue and malaria 
can overwhelm health systems in resource-poor countries. Environmental management
strategies that reduce or eliminate vector breeding sites combined with improved 
personal prevention strategies can help to significantly reduce transmission of
these infections.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and
practices (KAPs) of residents in western Jamaica regarding control of mosquito
vectors and protection from mosquito bites.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted between May and August 2010 among 
patients or family members of patients waiting to be seen at hospitals in western
Jamaica. Participants completed an interviewer-administered questionnaire on
sociodemographic factors and KAPs regarding VBDs. KAP scores were calculated and 
categorized as high or low based on the number of correct or positive responses. 
Logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify predictors of KAP and
linear regression analysis conducted to determine if knowledge and attitude
scores predicted practice scores.
FINDINGS: In all, 361 (85 men and 276 women) people participated in the study.
Most participants (87%) scored low on knowledge and practice items (78%).
Conversely, 78% scored high on attitude items. By multivariate logistic
regression, housewives were 82% less likely than laborers to have high attitude
scores; homeowners were 65% less likely than renters to have high attitude
scores. Participants from households with 1 to 2 children were 3.4 times more
likely to have high attitude scores compared with those from households with no
children. Participants from households with at least 5 people were 65% less
likely than those from households with fewer than 5 people to have high practice 
scores. By multivariable linear regression knowledge and attitude scores were
significant predictors of practice score.
CONCLUSION: The study revealed poor knowledge of VBDs and poor prevention
practices among participants. It identified specific groups that can be targeted 
with vector control and personal protection interventions to decrease
transmission of the infections.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the epidemiological characteristics and impact factors 
on hospitalization of Plasmodium vivax (P.vivax) since initiation of national
malaria elimination program, so as to facilitate the adjustment of technical
guideline in response to the epidemic changing of malaria in China.
METHODS: The data of individual P. vivax case (probable and confirmed) and
population during 2011-2014 were collated from China National Notifiable
Infectious Disease Reporting Information System, and the data of epidemiological 
investigation for individual P. vivax case (imported and indigenous) during
2011-2014 were collected from China Parasite Disease Prevention and Control
Information System. All of the data didn't include China's Hongkong, Macao,
Taiwan and foreign cases. The risk factors on hospitalization were explored by
multiple factors variable binary classification unconditioned logistic regression
model.
RESULTS: During study period of four years, a total of 5 656 Plasmodium vivax
cases were detected. Among them, 69.9% (3 951 cases) were imported cases and
30.1% (1 705 cases) were autochthonous cases. The male cases accounted for 82.7% 
of all cases. Among the autochthonous cases, 535 cases (31.4%) occurred in the
cross-bordering areas, and 577 cases (33.8%) were reported in the junction of
difference provinces. The amount of autochthonous cases decreased from 1 363
cases in 2011 to 53 cases in 2014, and the county affected by autochthonous cases
was shrunk from 185 counties to 10 counties. The proportion of autochthonous
cases introduced by domestic migrants increased constantly, which reached 41.5%
in 2014. The imported cases were detected from 614 counties of 30 provinces, who 
were originated from 57 overseas countries of 4 continents, with Southeast Asia
being the leading origins (2 772 cases, 70.2%). There were 1 494 cases
hospitalized for treatment, with the male (OR=1.41, 95%CI: 1.16-1.71), 14 years
old and younger (OR=2.26, 95%CI: 1.44-3.56), and oversea imported cases (OR=2.73,
95%CI: 2.30-3.25) were the high risk group for hospitalization.
CONCLUSION: The scale and scope of P. vivax occurrence decreased dramatically
since initiation of malaria elimination grogram in 2010. However, the risk of P. 
vivax introduction by the overseas imported cases and domestic migrants should be
highlighted.

(1)Amhara Regional Health Bureau, Bahir Dar, Ethiopia.

BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Malaria is one of the leading public health challenges
in Ethiopia. To address this, the Federal Ministry of Ethiopia launched a
laboratory diagnosis programme for promoting use of either rapid diagnostic tests
(RDTs) or Giemsa microscopy to all suspected malaria cases. This study was
conducted to assess the performance of RDT and influencing factors for Giemsa
microscopic diagnosis in Amhara region.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 10 high burden malaria
districts of Amhara region from 15 May to 15 June 2014. Data were collected using
structured questionnaire. Blood samples were collected from 1000 malaria
suspected cases in 10 health centers. RDT (SD BIOLINE) and Giemsa microscopy were
performed as per standard procedures. Kappa value, logistic regression and
chi-square test were used for statistical analysis.
RESULTS: The overall positivity rate (PR) of malaria parasites by RDT and Giemsa 
microscopy was 17.1 and 16.5% respectively. Compared to Giemsa microscopy as
"gold standard", RDT showed 83.9% sensitivity and 96% specificity. The level of
agreement between first reader and second reader for blood film microscopy was
moderate (Kappa value = 0.74). Logistic regression showed that male, under five
year of age and having fever more than 24 h prior to malaria diagnosis had
statistically significant association with malaria positivity rate for malaria
parasites.
INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: The overall specificity and negative predictive
values of RDT for malaria diagnosis were excellent. However, the sensitivity and 
positive predictive values of RDT were low. Therefore, in-service training,
quality monitoring of RDTs, and adequate laboratory supplies for diagnostic
services of malaria would be crucial for effective intervention measures.

Relationship of annual entomological inoculation rates to malaria transmission
indices, Bayelsa State, Nigeria.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Animal and Environmental Biology, University of Port Harcourt,
Port-Harcourt, Nigeria.

BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Generally, indepth understanding of the epidemiology of 
malaria is considered a prerequisite for planning effective control measures in
the endemic regions like sub-Saharan Africa. This study focuses on the
relationship of entomological inoculation rates (EIRs) to malaria incidence and
prevalence rates across eco-vegetational zones in Bayelsa State, Nigeria.
METHODS: Mosquito sampling was undertaken in seven towns/villages in seven local 
government areas (LGAs) in three eco-vegetational zones. Adults were collected
twice quarterly by the pyrethrum spray catch (PSC) technique. Anophelines were
separated morphologically and the sibling species were identified using PCR.
Detection of circumsporozoite (CS) antigen by ELISA was used for determining
mosquito infection rates. Man-biting, sporozoite and entomological inoculation
rates were calculated by standard methods. Simultaneously, malaria incidence and 
prevalence rates were calculated using data obtained from hospitals and by
examination of blood smears from consenting adults.
RESULTS: The estimated mean man-biting rate (MBR) over a 2-yr period was 6.88
bites/person/night. The highest MBR of 16.9 was in the mangrove coastal water
forest and the least, 11.3, was in brackish water swamp forest; differences were 
significant (t = 12.083; p<0.05). The mean sporozoite rate of Anopheles gambiae
sensu lato (s.l.) was 11%. The highest mean sporozoite rate was 13.4% for An.
gambiae sensu stricto (s.s.), followed by 7.9% for An. arabiensis and the least
was 0.4% for An. melas. Seasonal rates varied, highest for An. gambiae s.s. in
the dry season, but highest for An. arabiensis in the wet season. The annual
entomological inoculation rate of An. gambiae s.l. over a 2-yr period was 80.50
infective bites/person/year; the highest, 70.35 was in An. gambiae s.s. and the
least, 0.15 in An. melas. When prevalence (PR), incidence (IR) and entomological 
inoculation (EIR) rates were incorporated in a logistic regression model, they
showed 70.5 and 64% accuracy in predicting the relationship between EIR and,
incidence and prevalence rates respectively.
INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Based on EIR values malaria transmission was
classified as stable when EIR was >1.5 or unstable when EIR was ≤ 1.5. Although, 
earlier studies have shown correlation between EIRs and malaria PR, this study
demonstrated a significant correlation between EIRs and malaria incidence rates.

Malaria remains common in sub-Saharan Africa, but it is frequently over-diagnosed
and over-treated in hospitalized children. HIV is prevalent in many malaria
endemic areas and may delay parasite clearance and increase mortality among
children with malaria. This prospective cohort study enrolled children with
suspected malaria between 3 months and 12 years of age hospitalized at two
referral hospitals in Tanzania. Both a thick blood smear (BS) and a malaria rapid
diagnostic test (mRDT) were performed. If discordant results were obtained, PCR
was performed for Plasmodium falciparum. Malaria was confirmed if two out of
three tests were positive. Malaria parasite densities were determined for two
consecutive days after diagnosis and treatment of malaria. All participants were 
tested for HIV. Among 1492 hospitalized children, 400 (26.8%) were enrolled with 
suspected malaria infection. There were 196/400 (49.0%) males, and the median age
was 18 [9-36] months. BS was positive in 95/400 (23.8%), and mRDT was positive in
70/400 (17.5%), with moderate agreement (Kappa=0.598). Concordant results
excluded malaria in 291/400 (72.8%) and confirmed malaria in 56/400 (14.0%). PCR 
performed on 53 discordant results confirmed malaria in 1/39 of the
BS-positive/mRDT-negative cases, and 6/14 of the BS-negative/mRDT-positive cases.
The prevalence of confirmed malaria was 63/400 (15.8%). In multivariable logistic
regression, malaria was associated with HIV (OR 3.45 [1.65-7.20], p=0.001).
Current breastfeeding (OR 0.25 [0.11-0.56], p=0.001) and higher hemoglobin (OR
0.70 [0.60-0.81], p<0.001 per 1g/dL) were associated with decreased odds of
malaria. Malaria parasite clearance was delayed in HIV-infected participants
(p<0.001). Malaria is over-diagnosed even at referral centers in high
transmission areas. Hospitalized HIV-infected children are more likely to have
malaria and exhibit delayed clearance of parasites. Hospitals should consider
using mRDTs as a first step for malaria testing among hospitalized children in
sub-Saharan Africa.

OBJECTIVES: Increased demand for antiretroviral therapy (ART) services combined
with plateaued levels of development assistance for HIV/AIDS requires that
national ART programmes monitor programme effectiveness. In this pilot study, we 
compared commonly utilised performance metrics of 12- and 24-month retention with
rates of viral load (VL) suppression at 15 health facilities in Uganda.
METHODS: Retrospective chart review from which 12- and 24-month retention rates
were estimated, and parallel HIV RNA VL testing on consecutive adult patients who
presented to clinics and had been on ART for a minimum of six months. Rates of VL
suppression were then calculated at each facility and compared to retention rates
to assess the correlation between performance metrics. Multilevel logistic
regression models predicting VL suppression and 12- and 24-month retention were
constructed to estimate facility effects.
RESULTS: We collected VL samples from 2961 patients and found that 88% had a VL
≤1000 copies/ml. Facility rates of VL suppression varied between 77% and 96%.
When controlling for patient mix, a significant variation in facility performance
persisted. Retention rates at 12 and 24 months were 91% and 79%, respectively,
with a comparable facility-level variation. However, neither 12-month (ρ = 0.16) 
nor 24-month (ρ = -0.19) retention rates were correlated with facility rates of
VL suppression.
CONCLUSIONS: Retaining patients in care and suppressing VL are both critical
outcomes. Given the lack of correlation noted in this study, the utilisation of
VL monitoring may be necessary to truly assess the effectiveness of health
facilities delivering ART services.

BACKGROUND: Pediatric hospital mortality from infectious diseases in resource
constrained countries remains unacceptably high. Improved methods of
risk-stratification can assist in referral decision making and resource
allocation. The purpose of this study was to create prediction models for
in-hospital mortality among children admitted with suspected infectious diseases.
METHODS: This two-site prospective observational study enrolled children between 
6 months and 5 years admitted with a proven or suspected infection. Baseline
clinical and laboratory variables were collected on enrolled children. The
primary outcome was death during admission. Stepwise logistic regression
minimizing Akaike's information criterion was used to identify the most promising
multivariate models. The final model was chosen based on parsimony.
RESULTS: 1307 children were enrolled consecutively, and 65 (5%) of whom died
during their admission. Malaria, pneumonia and gastroenteritis were diagnosed in 
50%, 31% and 8% of children, respectively. The primary model included an abnormal
Blantyre coma scale, HIV and weight-for-age z-score. This model had an area under
the curve (AUC) of 0.85 (95% CI, 0.80-0.89) with a sensitivity and specificity of
83% and 76%, respectively. The positive and negative predictive values were 15%
and 99%, respectively. Two alternate models with similar performance
characteristics were developed withholding HIV and weight-for-age z-score, for
use when these variables are not available.
CONCLUSIONS: Risk stratification of children admitted with infectious diseases
can be calculated based on several easily measured variables. Risk stratification
at admission can be used for allocation of scarce human and physical resources
and to guide referral among children admitted to lower level health facilities.

BACKGROUND: Intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) with
sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) has been adopted as policy by most countries in
sub-Saharan Africa. This cross-sectional study assessed the prevalence of IPTp-SP
usage for prevention of malaria among pregnant women as well as evaluated factors
associated with IPTp-SP use during pregnancy in Sekondi-Takoradi region of Ghana.
METHODS: Pregnant women attending their antenatal-care with either
clinical/ultrasound evidence of pregnancy were recruited. Venous blood was
screened for malaria using RAPID response antibody kit and Giemsa staining.
Haemoglobin estimations were done by cyanmethemoglobin method while Human
Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) screening was performed by the national diagnostic
algorithm of two rapid antibody test and western blot confirmation.
RESULTS: Of the 754 consented pregnant women interviewed in this study, 57.8% had
received IPTp-SP while 42.2% had not at their first contact with the study
personnel. Furthermore, 18.6% (81/436) of those that received IPTp-SP were
malaria positive while 81.4% (355/436) were malaria negative. The results also
indicated that 47.7% (51/107) of the pregnant women in their third trimester who 
were meant to have received at least two-doses of SP had received ≥2 doses while 
35.5% (38/107) had received 1 dose. In multivariable logistic regression
analysis, pregnant women in their third trimester who received ≥2 doses of SP
showed decreased likelihoods of malaria (adjusted OR, 0.042; 95% CI, 0.003-0.51; 
P = 0.013).
CONCLUSION: IPTp-SP usage among pregnant women in Sekondi-Takoradi reduces
malaria and its use for malaria prevention should be strengthened with proper
dosage completion and coverage.

BACKGROUND: Clustering commonly affects the uncertainty of parameter estimates in
epidemiological studies. Cluster-robust variance estimates (CRVE) are used to
construct confidence intervals that account for single-level clustering, and are 
easily implemented in standard software. When data are clustered at more than one
level (e.g. village and household) the level for the CRVE must be chosen. CRVE
are consistent when used at the higher level of clustering (village), but since
there are fewer clusters at the higher level, and consistency is an asymptotic
property, there may be circumstances under which coverage is better from lower-
rather than higher-level CRVE. Here we assess the relative importance of
adjusting for clustering at the higher and lower level in a logistic regression
model.
METHODS: We performed a simulation study in which the coverage of 95 % confidence
intervals was compared between adjustments at the higher and lower levels.
RESULTS: Confidence intervals adjusted for the higher level of clustering had
coverage close to 95 %, even when there were few clusters, provided that the
intra-cluster correlation of the predictor was less than 0.5 for models with a
single predictor and less than 0.2 for models with multiple predictors.
CONCLUSIONS: When there are multiple levels of clustering it is generally
preferable to use confidence intervals that account for the highest level of
clustering. This only fails if there are few clusters at this level and the
intra-cluster correlation of the predictor is high.

What Factors are Responsible for Higher Prevalence of HIV Infection among Urban
Women than Rural Women in Tanzania?

Singh RK(1), Patra S(1).

Author information: 
(1)International institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.

BACKGROUND: Tanzania is the country hit the hardest by the HIV epidemic in
Sub-Saharan Africa. The present study was carried out to examine the factors of
HIV infection among women who lived in an urban area in Tanzania.
METHODS: The Tanzania HIV/AIDS and Malaria Indicator Survey (2011-12) data was
used. The sample size for urban and rural women who had been tested for HIV and
ever had sex was 2227 and 6210 respectively. Bivariate and multivariate logistic 
regression analyses were used.
RESULTS: The present study found that rural women were significantly less likely 
to be HIV-infected compared to urban women (OR = 0.612, p<0.00). About 10% urban 
women were HIV-infected whereas 5.8% women in rural areas were HIV positive.
Women who had more than five sex partners were significantly four times more
likely to be HIV-infected as compared to women who had one sex partner (OR =
4.49, p<0.00).
CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that less-educated women, women
belonging to poor or poorer quintile, women spending nights outside and women
having more than one sex partner were significantly more likely to have HIV
infection among urban women as compared to rural women. There is an urgent need
for a short and effective program to control the HIV epidemic in urban areas of
Tanzania especially for less-educated urban women.

BACKGROUND: Childhood mortality is a stubborn problem and remains highest in
Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Existing research on childhood mortality in SSA
indicate that most of the childhood deaths are from preventable causes such as
diarrhoea, pneumonia, measles, malaria, HIV and underlying malnutrition, acute
respiratory infections, whooping cough, tuberculosis, bronchopneumonia, dirty
feeding bottles and utensils, inadequate disposal of household refuse and poor
storage of drinking water. However, insufficient attention has been given to
maternal marital status and childhood mortality relationships. Understanding the 
implications of maternal marital status for childhood mortality can add to our
knowledge of the correlates of neonatal and infant mortality and furnish insights
to support the design and delivery of interventions to address the problem.
OBJECTIVE: To document and examine the extent to which the association between
neonatal and infant mortality varies between single and ever-married mothers in
Sierra Leone, Burkina Faso, and Burundi. A single mother is defined in this study
as a woman who has either lived with a partner, married before, widowed,
separated during the survey periods and has given at least one life birth.
Ever-married woman is woman who has been married at least once in their lives
although their current marital status may not be married.
STUDY DESIGN: Data for this study were drawn from the latest Demographic and
Health Surveys (DHS) in Burkina Faso, Sierra Leone and Burundi. The selected
datasets came from 2010 Burkina Faso DHS (BFDHS), 2008 Sierra Leone DHS (SLDHS)
and 2010 Burundi DHS (EDSB II).
METHODS: The relevant data for this study (women age 15-49 years who had at least
one live birth within the five years preceding the survey) were extracted from
the whole dataset of each country (Burkinabe (n = 17,087), Sierra Leonean
(n = 7374) and Burundian (n = 9389). Univariate and multivariate statistical
analyses were used to assess the association between neonatal and infant
mortality and maternal marital status. All data were analysed using STATA Version
11.
RESULTS: The multivariate logistic regression analyses yielded significantly
increased risk of neonatal and infant mortality among single mothers.
CONCLUSIONS: Neonates and infants of single mothers are at increased risk of
neonatal and infant mortality compared to those of ever-married women.

BACKGROUND: As momentum towards malaria elimination grows, strategies are being
developed for scale-up in elimination settings. One prominent strategy, reactive 
case detection (RACD), involves screening and treating individuals living in
close proximity to passively detected, or "index" cases. This study aims to use
RACD to quantify Plasmodium parasitaemia in households of index cases, and
identify risk factors for infection; these data could inform reactive screening
approaches and identify target risk groups.
METHODS: This study was conducted in the Western Cambodian province of Pailin
between May 2013 and March 2014 among 440 households. Index participants/index
cases (n = 270) and surrounding households (n = 110) were screened for Plasmodium
infection with rapid diagnostic tests (RDT), microscopy and real-time polymerase 
chain reaction (PCR). Participants were interviewed to identify risk factors. A
comparison group of 60 randomly-selected households was also screened, to compare
infection levels of RACD and non-RACD households. In order to identify potential 
risk factors that would inform screening approaches and identify risk groups,
multivariate logistic regression models were applied.
RESULTS: Nine infections were identified in households of index cases (RACD
approach) through RDT screening of 1898 individuals (seven Plasmodium vivax, two 
Plasmodium falciparum); seven were afebrile. Seventeen infections were identified
through PCR screening of 1596 individuals (15 P. vivax, and 22 % P. falciparum/P.
vivax mixed infections). In the control group, 25 P. falciparum infections were
identified through PCR screening of 237 individuals, and no P. vivax was found.
Plasmodium falciparum infection was associated with fever (p = 0.013), being a
member of a control household (p ≤ 0.001), having a history of malaria infection 
(p = 0.041), and sleeping without a mosquito net (p = 0.011). Significant
predictors of P. vivax infection, as diagnosed by PCR, were fever (p = 0.058,
borderline significant) and history of malaria infection (p ≤ 0.001).
CONCLUSION: This study found that RACD identified very few secondary infections
when targeting index and neighbouring households for screening. The results
suggest RACD is not appropriate, where exposure to malaria occurs away from the
community, and there is a high level of treatment-seeking from the private
sector. Piloting RACD in a range of transmission settings would help to identify 
the ideal environment for feasible and effective reactive screening methods.

BACKGROUND: Parasitic infection(s) during pregnancy have been associated with
increased risk of pregnancy complications and adverse outcomes in low resource
settings. However, little is known about their influence on pregnancy outcomes.
This study aimed to determine the prevalence of parasitic infections and their
association with pregnancy complications and adverse outcomes.
METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted using
maternally-linked data from Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Center (KCMC) medical
birth registry. Birth records from all women who delivered singleton infants from
2000-2011 were utilized. We excluded multiple gestations and rural medical
referral for various medical complications. A total of 30,797 births were
evaluated. Data analysis was performed using SPSS version 18.0. Odds ratio (ORs) 
with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) for adverse pregnancy outcomes and
complications associated with parasitic infections were estimated using multiple 
logistic regression models. A p-value of less than 5 % was considered
statistically significant.
RESULTS: The most prevalent parasitic infection recorded was malaria (17.0 %),
while helminths and amebiasis were infrequently recorded (0.6 % vs. 0.7 %,
respectively). Women who had malaria during pregnancy had 13 % increased odds of 
having a preterm delivery (OR = 1.13; 95 % CI: 1.01-1. 26) as compared to those
who were not infected. They also had 33 % increased odds of getting maternal
anemia (OR = 1.33; 95 % CI: 1.11-1.72). Likewise, pregnant women who were
recorded with helminths infections had 29 % increased odds of having maternal
anemia as compared to those who had no helminths infection (OR = 1.29; 95 %
CI:0.48-3.53). Moreover, pregnant women who were recorded to have amebiasis had
79 % increased odds of having a preterm delivery as compared to those who had no 
ameba infection (OR = 1.79; 95 % CI: 1.12-2.91).
CONCLUSIONS: Malaria was the prevalent parasitic infection in the studied
population while helminth and ameba infections were infrequently reported. These 
parasitic infections were also associated with increased risk of anemia and
delivery of a preterm infant. These were the only three infections/infestations
which were evaluated. Our analysis revealed that malaria, helminth and ameba
infections during pregnancy is dangerous and has life threatening consequences.
This highlight the need to provide early diagnosis and treatment for infected
women to prevent pregnancy complications and associated adverse pregnancy
outcomes.

BACKGROUND: There is a high prevalence of HIV/syphilis among male sex workers,
but no formal study has ever been conducted focusing on male clients of male sex 
workers (MCM). A detailed investigation was thus called for, to determine the
burden and sociobehavioral determinants of HIV and syphilis among these MCM in
China.
METHODS: As part of a multicenter cross-sectional study, using respondent-driven 
and snowball sampling, 2958 consenting adult men who have sex with men (MSM) were
recruited, interviewed, and tested for HIV and syphilis between 2008 and 2009.
The distributions of sociodemographic characteristics, risk behaviors, and
HIV/syphilis prevalence were determined and compared between MCM and other MSM.
RESULTS: Among recruited MSM, 5.0% (n = 148) were MCM. HIV prevalences for MCM
and other MSM were 7.4% and 7.7%, whereas 18.9% and 14.0% were positive for
syphilis, respectively. Condomless anal intercourse (CAI) was reported by 59.5%
of MCM and 48.2% of MSM. Multiple logistic regression revealed that compared with
other MSM, MCM were more likely to have less education [for ≤ elementary level,
adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 3.13, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.42 to
6.90], higher income (for >500 US Dollars per month, aOR = 2.97, 95% CI: 1.53 to 
5.77), more often found partners at parks/restrooms (aOR = 4.01, 95% CI: 2.34 to 
6.85), reported CAI (aOR = 1.49, 95% CI: 1.05 to 2.10), reported a larger sexual 
network (for ≥ 10, aOR = 2.70, 95% CI: 1.44 to 5.07), and higher odds of syphilis
(aOR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.00 to 2.38).
CONCLUSIONS: The greater frequency of risk behaviors and high prevalence of HIV
and syphilis indicated that HIV/syphilis prevention programs in China need to pay
special attention to MCM as a distinct subgroup, which was completely ignored
until date.

BACKGROUND: Malaria accounts for about 300,000 childhood deaths and 30% of
under-five year old mortality in Nigeria annually. We assessed the impact of
intervention strategies that integrated Patent Medicines Vendors into community
case management of childhood-diseases, improved access to artemisinin combination
therapy (ACT) and distributed bed nets to households. We explored the influence
of household socioeconomic characteristics on the impact of the interventions on 
fever in the under-five year olds in Bauchi State Nigeria.
METHODS: A cross-sectional case-controlled, interventional study, which sampled
3077 and 2737 under-5 year olds from 1,588 and 1601 households in pre- and
post-intervention periods respectively, was conducted from 2013 to 2015.
Difference-in-differences and logistic regression analyses were performed to
estimate the impact attributable to the interventions: integrated community case 
management of childhood illness which introduced trained public and private
sector health providers and the possession of nets on the prevalence of fever.
RESULTS: Two-week prevalence of fever among under-fives declined from 56.6% at
pre-intervention to 42.5% at post-intervention. Fever-prevention fraction
attributable to nets was statistically significant (OR = 0.217, 95% CI:
0.08-0.33). Children in the intervention group had significantly fewer incidence 
of fever than children in the control group had (OR = 0.765, 95% CI: 0.67-0.87). 
Although being in the intervention group significantly provided 23.5% protection 
against fever (95% CI: 0.13-0.33), the post-intervention likelihood of fever was 
also significantly less than at pre-intervention (OR = 0.57, 95% CI: 0.50-0.65). 
The intervention protection fraction against fever was statistically significant 
at 43.4% (OR = 0.434, 95% CI: 0.36-0.50). Logistic regression showed that the
odds of fever were lower in households with nets (OR = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.60-0.88), 
among children whose mothers had higher education, in the post-intervention
period (OR = 0.39, 95% CI: 0.33-0.46) and in the intervention group (OR = 0.52,
95% CI: 0.48-0.66). The odds of fever increased with higher socio-economic status
of households (17.9%-19.5%). Difference-in-differences showed that the
interventions significantly reduced occurrence of fever in the intervention group
(OR = 1.70, 95% CI: 1.36-2.14).
CONCLUSION: The interventions were effective in reducing the prevalence and the
likelihood of childhood malaria fever. Taken to scale, these can significantly
reduce the burden of malaria fever in the under-five year old children.

BACKGROUND: Ethiopia is rapidly increasing insecticide-treated nets (ITNs)
coverage to combat malaria, but adequate follow-up and factors affecting use of
ITNs is lacking. The aim of this study was to assess determinants of the use of
ITNs in a southwest area of Ethiopia.
METHODS: This cross-sectional survey was conducted in the Chewaka district
settlement area of southwest Oromia from March to May, 2013. Kebeles were
stratified by degree of urbanization (rural, peri-urban, or urban). Randomly
selected households, which had been freely supplied with at least one ITN, were
surveyed using a pre-tested, structured questionnaire administered through
household interviews. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the
association between use of ITNs and determinant factors.
RESULTS: Of 574 households surveyed, 72.6 % possessed ITNs and 80 % of these had 
been used the night before the survey. The most common reasons for the absence
ITNs in the household identified in this study were ITNs were old and therefore
discarded and that households use ITNs for purposes other than their intended
use. The multivariate analysis found that knowledge of malaria transmission by
mosquito bites (Adjusted OR = 3.44, 95 % CI: 1.80-6.59), and washing of ITNs at
least once by households (Adjusted OR = 2.66, 95 % CI: 1.35-5.26) were
significantly associated with an ITN being used by households. The mean
possession was 1.59 ITN per household (3.57 persons per an ITN). One hundred
fifty four (36.9 %) of ITNs had at least one hole/tear. Among these, 108 (70.1 %)
ITNs had at least one hole/tear with greater than 2 cm and 29 (18.8 %) had
greater than seven holes/tears.
CONCLUSIONS: This study in Southwest Ethiopia showed a high proportion of net
ownership compared to a household survey from Ethiopia which included in the
World Malaria Report. Despite somewhat high percentages ITN ownership, the study 
demonstrated there was still a gap between ownership and use of ITNs. Use of ITNs
was affected by knowledge of malaria transmission by mosquito bite and washing of
ITNs at least once by households. Intensive health education and community
mobilization efforts should be employed to attempt to influence these factors
that significantly affect ITN use.

OBJECTIVE: The prevalence of anaemia during pregnancy is estimated to be 35-75%
in sub-Saharan Africa and is associated with an increased risk of maternal
mortality. We evaluated the frequency and factors associated with anaemia in
HIV-infected women undergoing antiretroviral (ARV) therapy for prevention of
mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) enrolled in The Kisumu Breastfeeding Study
2003-2009.
METHODS: Maternal haematological parameters were monitored from 32 to 34 weeks of
gestation to 2 years post-delivery among 522 enrolled women. Clinical and
laboratory assessments for causes of anaemia were performed, and appropriate
management was initiated. Anaemia was graded using the National Institutes of
Health Division of AIDS 1994 Adult Toxicity Tables. Data were analysed using SAS 
software, v 9.2. The Wilcoxon two-sample rank test was used to compare groups. A 
logistic regression model was fitted to describe the trend in anaemia over time.
RESULTS: At enrolment, the prevalence of any grade anaemia (Hb < 9.4 g/dl) was
61.8%, but fell during ARV therapy, reaching a nadir (7.4%) by 6 months
post-partum. A total of 41 women (8%) developed severe anaemia (Hb < 7 g/dl)
during follow-up; 2 (4.9%) were hospitalised for blood transfusion, whereas 3
(7.3%) were transfused while hospitalised (for delivery). The greatest proportion
of severe anaemia events occurred around delivery (48.8%; n = 20). Anaemia (Hb ≥ 
7 and < 9.4 g/dl) at enrolment was associated with severe anaemia at delivery (OR
5.87; 95% CI: 4.48, 7.68, P < 0.01). Few cases of severe anaemia coincided with
clinical malaria (24.4%; n = 10) and helminth (7.3%; n = 3) infections.
CONCLUSION: Resolution of anaemia among most participants during study follow-up 
was likely related to receipt of ARV therapy. Efforts should be geared towards
addressing common causes of anaemia in HIV-infected pregnant women, prioritising 
initiation of ARV therapy and management of peripartum blood loss.

Stagnant Stunting Rate despite Rapid Economic Growth-An Analysis of Cross
Sectional Survey Data of Undernutrition among Children under Five in Papua New
Guinea.

Background: Maternal and child under-nutrition is a pervasive and detrimental
condition in Papua New Guinea (PNG). Despite the rapid economic growth during the
past decade, the stunting rate for children under 5 has remained at 46 percent in
PNG.
Objective: The objective of the study was to analyze the association between the 
demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related factors with undernutrition for
children less than five years old in PNG.
Data and Method: The study used the 2009-2010 PNG Household Income and
Expenditure Survey (HIES). The final sample included 3057 children under 5 years 
old. Logistic regression analyses were used to assess the odds of stunting,
wasting and underweight. Odds ratios were adjusted for independent variables at
household and individual levels. Statistical analyses were done with Stata
(version 14).
Findings: Logistic regression analysis showed household wealth was a significant 
predictor of stunting: children in the richest wealth quintile were 28.9% (0.711 
[0.53-0.95]) less likely to be stunted than were children in the poorest wealth
quintile. Other factors also associated with stunting include geographic
locations, household head education and incidence of malaria. Similar results
were found when wasting and underweight were dependent variables.

Malaria is one of the most important public health problems in Ethiopia. The
objective of this study was to identify the prevalence and associated factors of 
malaria among children who presented for investigation. A cross-sectional health 
facility-based study was conducted between October and November 2012 in East
Shewa Zone of Oromia Regional Sate in Ethiopia. Blood samples by finger pricks
were collected for microscopic diagnosis of malaria from children under the age
of 16 years with symptoms suggestive of malaria attending five health centers. An
interview was conducted with the parents/guardians of the children using a
pre-tested structured questionnaire. Bivariate and multivariate logistic
regression was employed to study associations between malaria infection and
associated factors. Of 830 children who provided blood samples, 170/830 (20.5%)
were microscopically confirmed for malaria parasites. The predominant Plasmodium 
species were Plasmodium vivax (11.7%) and Plasmodium falciparum (8.4%), whilst
mixed infections of both species were identified in 0.4% of patients (relative
proportion: 57.1%, 41.2%, and 1.8%, respectively). Household's ownership of
insecticide treated nets (ITNs) was significantly associated with decreased odds 
of malaria infection (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 0.69, 95% confidence interval
[CI]: 0.56-0.85). However, an increased odds of malaria infection was observed
among children between 10 and 15 years old (aOR: 2.19, 95% CI: 1.25-3.83)
compared to children under the age of 2 years. The strong association reported
here between household's ownership of ITNs and malaria infection among children
in this part of Ethiopia call for continued efforts of net distribution and use
to control malaria, which in turn might improve children's health and
development.

BACKGROUND: The factors leading to poor outcomes in malaria infection are
incompletely understood. Common genetic variation exists in the human genes for
Toll like receptors (TLRs) that alter host responses to pathogen-associated
molecular patterns. Genetic variation in TLR1 and TLR6 could alter the risk of
development of complicated malaria and ability of the host to control the
parasite burden during acute Plasmodium falciparum infection.
METHODS: Five single nucleotide polymorphisms in TLR1 and TLR6 in 432 patients
with clinical P. falciparum monoinfection acquired on the Thai-Myanmar border
were genotyped. Using logistic regression, associations with the development of
complicated malaria and the percentage of infected erythrocytes (parasitaemia) on
the day of presentation to clinical care (day zero) were tested.
RESULTS: Genotypes carrying the T (major) allele of TLR1 rs5743551--an allele
associated with improved outcomes in sepsis--were associated with higher
parasitaemia measured on day zero (p = 0.03).
DISCUSSION: Since malaria exerts strong genetic pressure on the human genome,
protection from parasitaemia associated with TLR1 rs5743551 may account for the
maintenance of an allele associated with poor outcomes in Caucasians with sepsis.
CONCLUSION: These data suggest that genetic variation in TLR1 has effects on the 
host response to Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Asian populations. Genotypes
from TLR6 showed no evidence of association with either complicated malaria or
parasite burden.

BACKGROUND: Insecticide treated nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS)
have been scaled up for malaria prevention in sub-Saharan Africa. However, there 
are few studies on the benefit of implementing IRS in areas with moderate to high
coverage of ITNs. We evaluated the impact of an IRS program on malaria related
outcomes in western Kenya, an area of intense perennial malaria transmission and 
moderate ITN coverage (55-65% use of any net the previous night).
METHODS: The Kenya Division of Malaria Control, with support from the US
President's Malaria Initiative, conducted IRS in one lowland endemic district
with moderate coverage of ITNs. Surveys were conducted in the IRS district and a 
neighboring district before IRS, after one round of IRS in July-Sept 2008 and
after a second round of IRS in April-May 2009. IRS was conducted with pyrethroid 
insecticides. At each survey, 30 clusters were selected for sampling and within
each cluster, 12 compounds were randomly selected. The primary outcomes measured 
in all residents of selected compounds included malaria parasitemia, clinical
malaria (P. falciparum infection plus history of fever) and anemia (Hb<8) of all 
residents in randomly selected compounds. At each survey round, individuals from 
the IRS district were matched to those from the non-IRS district using propensity
scores and multivariate logistic regression models were constructed based on the 
matched dataset.
RESULTS: At baseline and after one round of IRS, there were no differences
between the two districts in the prevalence of malaria parasitemia, clinical
malaria or anemia. After two rounds of IRS, the prevalence of malaria parasitemia
was 6.4% in the IRS district compared to 16.7% in the comparison district (OR =
0.36, 95% CI = 0.22-0.59, p<0.001). The prevalence of clinical malaria was also
lower in the IRS district (1.8% vs. 4.9%, OR = 0.37, 95% CI = 0.20-0.68, p =
0.001). The prevalence of anemia was lower in the IRS district but only in
children under 5 years of age (2.8% vs. 9.3%, OR = 0.30, 95% CI = 0.13-0.71, p = 
0.006). Multivariate models incorporating both IRS and ITNs indicated that both
had an impact on malaria parasitemia and clinical malaria but the independent
effect of ITNs was reduced in the district that had received two rounds of IRS.
There was no statistically significant independent effect of ITNs on the
prevalence of anemia in any age group.
CONCLUSIONS: Both IRS and ITNs are effective tools for reducing malaria burden
and when implemented in an area of moderate to high transmission with moderate
ITN coverage, there may be an added benefit of IRS. The value of adding ITNs to
IRS is less clear as their benefits may be masked by IRS. Additional monitoring
of malaria control programs that implement ITNs and IRS concurrently is
encouraged to better understand how to maximize the benefits of both
interventions, particularly in the context of increasing pyrethroid resistance.

BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a known complication of malaria, and is 
reported to occur in up to 40% of adult patients with a severe Plasmodium
falciparum infection in endemic regions. To gain insight in the incidence and
risk factors of AKI in imported P. falciparum malaria, a retrospective analysis
was performed on a large cohort of mostly non-immune patients with imported P.
falciparum malaria. Aiming to include not only severe but also milder forms of
renal failure, the KDIGO criteria were used to define AKI.
METHODS: Clinical and laboratory data from 485 consecutive cases of imported P.
falciparum malaria were extracted from the Rotterdam Malaria Cohort database.
Acute kidney injury (AKI) was defined using the KDIGO criteria. Univariate and
multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify risk factors for 
AKI.
RESULTS: AKI was seen in 39 (8%) of all patients and in 23 (38%) of the 61
patients with severe malaria. Eight patients eventually needed renal replacement 
therapy (RRT); seven of them already had AKI at presentation. Higher age, higher 
leucocyte count and thrombocytopaenia were independently-associated with AKI but 
their positive predictive values were relatively poor.
CONCLUSION: AKI was found to be a common complication in adults with imported P. 
falciparum necessitating RRT in only a small minority of patients. The use of the
KDIGO staging allows early recognition of a decline in renal function.

BACKGROUND: Under trial conditions insecticide-treated nets have been shown to
provide significant clinical and mortality protection under a range of malaria
transmission intensity conditions. There are, however, few operational impact
data, notably in very intense transmission conditions. This study, reports on
malaria infection among Kenyan schoolchildren living in areas of intense malaria 
transmission and their reported use of insecticide-treated bed nets.
METHODS: 5188 children in 54 schools were randomly sampled from seven counties
surrounding Lake Victoria between May and June 2014. A questionnaire was
administered to schoolchildren in classes 2-6 on the use of a long-lasting,
insecticide-treated net (LLIN) the night before the survey and provided a single 
blood sample for a rapid diagnostic test for malaria infection. Analysis of the
impact of insecticide-treated net use on malaria prevalence was undertaken using 
a multivariable, mixed effects, logistic regression at 95% confidence interval
(CI), taking into account hierarchical nature of the data and results adjusted
for school clusters.
RESULTS: The overall prevalence of malaria infection was 48.7%, two-thirds
(67.9%) of the children reported using LLIN, 91.3% of the children reported that 
their households own at least one LLIN and the household LLIN coverage was 2.5
persons per one LLIN. The prevalence of infection showed variation across the
counties, with prevalence being highest in Busia (66.9%) and Homabay (51.8%)
counties, and lowest in Migori County (29.6%). Generally, malaria parasite
prevalence differed between age groups and gender with the highest prevalence
occurring in children below 7 years (50.6%) and males (52.2%). Adjusting for
county and school, there was a significant reduction in odds of malaria infection
among the schoolchildren who reported LLIN use the previous night by 14 % (aOR
0.86, 95% CI 0.74-0.98, P < 0.027).
CONCLUSION: Malaria transmission continues to be high around Lake Victoria.
Despite evidence of increasing pyrethroid resistance and the likely overall
efficacy of LLIN distributed several years prior to the survey, LLIN continue to 
provide protection against infection among school-aged children.

Eight consecutive annual cross-sectional surveys were conducted to examine the
trend of the prevalence of HIV, syphilis, drug use and their correlates among
female sex workers (FSWs) in Qingdao, China. Among sampled FSWs over the 8 years,
a higher proportion of older, married or cohabited, higher education levels and
more on-call FSWs were observed in recent years. The syphilis prevalence
increased significantly from 1.0 % in 2006 to 13.5 % in 2013, with illicit drug
use rate ranging from 21.8 % in 2007 to 55.5 % in 2010. Multivariate logistic
regression analyses showed that drug use, syphilis and unprotected vaginal sex
predicted each other. The dual epidemics of illicit drug use and syphilis among
FSWs underscore the urgency to implement a tailored intervention to curb the dual
epidemics while also preventing an HIV epidemic in the context of diversified
commercial sex dynamic.

BACKGROUND: Anopheles darlingi is considered the most efficient malaria vector in
the Neotropical region. In Mexico, its role as an incriminated vector of
Plasmodium has not been confirmed in the Lacandon forest. Similarly, knowledge
about bionomic and larval ecology is scarce. The study aim was to identify and
describe the larval habitats of An. darlingi in Chiapas, México.
METHODS: Standard larval collections were performed in the Lacandon forest region
and in the Soconusco region of southern Chiapas from January 2010 to April 2014, 
including dry and rainy seasons. Mean larval density of An. darlingi was
estimated according to hydrological types, and associations between the presence 
of An. darlingi and environmental factors including ecological parameters and
geographic positions were statistically analysed.
RESULTS: One hundred and twelve aquatic habitats were analysed, 80 from the
Lacandon forest region and 32 from the Soconusco region; 94.64% of these sites
presented anopheline larvae. In total, 10,977 larvae belonging to 11 Anopheles
species were collected. The 19 (out of 112) larval habitats positive to An.
darlingi were: rain puddles (26.32%), ground pools (21.05%), ponds (15.79%),
ditches (15.79%), river margins (10.53%) and streams (10.53%). Overall, the
average (±SD) larval density was 6.60 ± 2.41 larvae per dip. Multiple logistic
regression analysis showed that temporary habitats, green algae presence and
stagnant water were associated with An. darlingi larval presence. The positive
habitats were found in the Lacandon forest region during the rainy season
(May-September). No specimens were found in the Soconusco region of the coastal
plain of Chiapas.
CONCLUSION: The mosquito An. darlingi larval habitats were found in different
hydrological types. The habitat stability, presence of algae and water current
were the main factors for An. darlingi larval occurrence. The information on the 
characteristics of the larval habitats of An. darlingi will be useful in
sustainable programmes for malaria control in the Lacandon forest region,
Chiapas.

Comment in
    Lancet Haematol. 2015 Oct;2(10):e400-1.

BACKGROUND: The global prevalence of X-linked glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
(G6PD) deficiency is thought to be a result of selection by malaria, but
epidemiological studies have yielded confusing results. We investigated the
relationships between G6PD deficiency and both malaria and non-malarial illnesses
among children in Kenya.
METHODS: We did this study in Kilifi County, Kenya, where the G6PD c.202T allele 
is the only significant cause of G6PD deficiency. We tested the associations
between G6PD deficiency and severe and complicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria 
through a case-control study of 2220 case and 3940 control children. Cases were
children aged younger than 14 years, who visited the high dependency ward of
Kilifi County Hospital with severe malaria between March 1, 1998, and Feb 28,
2010. Controls were children aged between 3-12 months who were born within the
same study area between August 2006, and September 2010. We assessed the
association between G6PD deficiency and both uncomplicated malaria and other
common diseases of childhood in a cohort study of 752 children aged younger than 
10 years. Participants of this study were recruited from a representative sample 
of households within the Ngerenya and Chonyi areas of Kilifi County between Aug
1, 1998, and July 31, 2001. The primary outcome measure for the case-control
study was the odds ratio for hospital admission with severe malaria (computed by 
logistic regression) while for the cohort study it was the incidence rate ratio
for uncomplicated malaria and non-malaria illnesses (computed by Poisson
regression), by G6PD deficiency category.
FINDINGS: 2863 (73%) children in the control group versus 1643 (74%) in the case 
group had the G6PD normal genotype, 639 (16%) versus 306 (14%) were girls
heterozygous for G6PD c.202T, and 438 (11%) versus 271 (12%) children were either
homozygous girls or hemizygous boys. Compared with boys and girls without G6PD
deficiency, we found significant protection from severe malaria (odds ratio [OR] 
0·82, 95% CI 0·70-0·97; p=0·020) among G6PD c.202T heterozygous girls but no
evidence for protection among G6PD c.202T hemizygous boys and homozygous girls
(OR 1·18, 0·99-1·40; p=0·056). Median follow-up for the mild disease cohort study
was 2·24 years (IQR 2·22-2·85). G6PD c.202T had no effect on other common
diseases of childhood in heterozygous girls (incidence rate ratio 0·98, 95% CI
0·86-1·11; p=0·82) or homozygous girls or hemizygous boys (0·93, 0·82-1·04;
p=0·25), with the sole exception of a marginally significant increase in the
incidence of helminth infections among heterozygous girls.
INTERPRETATION: Heterozygous girls might be the driving force for the positive
selection of G6PD deficiency alleles. Further studies are needed to definitively 
establish the mechanisms by which G6PD deficiency confers an advantage against
malaria in heterozygous individuals. Such studies could lead to the development
of new treatments.

BACKGROUND: Malaria and HIV/AIDS constitute major public health problems in
Ethiopia, but the burden associated with malaria-HIV co-infection has not been
well documented. In this study, the burden of malaria among HIV positive and HIV 
negative adult outpatients attending health facilities in Oromia National
Regional State, Ethiopia was investigated.
METHODS: A comparative cross-sectional study among HIV-positive patients having
routine follow-up visits at HIV care and treatment clinics and HIV-seronegative
patients attending the general medical outpatient departments in 12 health
facilities during the peak malaria transmission season was conducted from
September to November, 2011. A total of 3638 patients (1819 from each group) were
enrolled in the study. Provider initiated testing and counseling of HIV was
performed for 1831 medical outpatients out of whom 1819 were negative and
enrolled into the study. Malaria blood microscopy and hemoglobin testing were
performed for all 3638 patients. Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics, 
Chi square test and multivariate logistic regression.
RESULTS: Of the 3638 patients enrolled in the study, malaria parasitaemia was
detected in 156 (4.3%); malaria parasitaemia prevalence was 0.7% (13/1819) among 
HIV-seropositive patients and 7.9% (143/1819) among HIV-seronegative patients.
Among HIV-seropositive individuals 65.4% slept under a mosquito bed net the night
before data collection, compared to 59.4% of HIV-seronegative individuals. A
significantly higher proportion of HIV-seropositive malaria-negative patients
were on co-trimoxazole (CTX) prophylaxis as compared to HIV-malaria co-infected
patients: 82% (1481/1806) versus 46% (6/13) (P = 0.001). HIV and malaria
co-infected patients were less likely to have the classical symptoms of malaria
(fever, chills and headache) compared to the HIV-seronegative and malaria
positive counterparts. Multivariate logistic regression showed that
HIV-seropositive patients who come for routine follow up were less likely to be
infected by malaria (OR = 0.23, 95% CI = 0.09-0.74).
CONCLUSION: The study documented lower malaria prevalence among the
HIV-seropositive attendants who come for routine follow up. Clinical symptoms of 
malaria were more pronounced among HIV-seronegative than HIV-seropositive
patients. This study also re-affirmed the importance of co-trimoxazole in
preventing malaria symptoms and parasitaemia among HIV-positive patients.

BACKGROUND: Antibodies (Ab) to VAR2CSA prevent Plasmodium falciparum-infected
erythrocytes from sequestrating in the placenta, i.e., prevent placental malaria 
(PM). The specificity of Ab to VAR2CSA associated with absence of PM is unknown. 
Accordingly, differences in the specificity of Ab to VAR2CSA were compared
between multigravidae with and without PM who had Ab to VAR2CSA.
METHODS: In a retrospective case-control study, plasma collected from Cameroonian
multigravidae with (n = 96) and without (n = 324) PM were screened in 21 assays
that measured antibody levels to full length VAR2CSA (FV2), individual VAR2CSA
DBL domains, VAR2CSA domains from different genetic backgrounds (variants), as
well as proportion of high avidity Ab to FV2.
RESULTS: Multigravidae with and without PM had similar levels of Ab to FV2, the
six VAR2CSA DBL domains and different variants, while the proportion of high
avidity Ab to FV2 was significantly higher in women without PM at delivery (p =
0.0030) compared to women with PM. In a logistic regression model adjusted for
gravidity and age, the percentage of high avidity Ab to FV2 was associated with
reduced likelihood of PM in multigravidae. A 5 % increase in proportion of high
avidity Ab to FV2 was associated with a nearly 15 % lower likelihood of PM.
CONCLUSION: Ab avidity to FV2 may be an important indicator of immunity to PM.

BACKGROUND: The hyperreactive malarial splenomegaly (HMS) represents a chronic,
potentially fatal complication of malaria. Case definition includes: gross
splenomegaly, high level of anti-malarial antibody and IgM, response to long-term
anti-malarial prophylaxis. In this study, a large series of patients not fully
meeting the case definition was tentatively classified as early hyperreactive
malarial splenomegaly (e-HMS). The main research questions was: does "e-HMS" tend
to evolve to the full-blown syndrome? And if so, what are the main factors
influencing this evolution?
METHODS: Retrospective, longitudinal study. The patient database was searched to 
retrieve all potentially eligible patients. e-HMS was defined by splenomegaly of 
any size (with or without raised IgM), high anti-malarial antibody titre and
exclusion of other causes of splenomegaly. The clinical outcome at following
visits was analysed in relation to re-exposure to malaria, and to treatment (only
part of the patients with e-HMS were treated with a single anti-malarial
treatment and advised to follow an effective anti-malarial prophylaxis, if
re-exposed). The association of the outcome with the main independent variables
was first assessed with univariate analysis. A stepwise logistic regression model
was then performed to study the association of the outcome with the main
independent variables.
RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-six subjects with e-HMS were retrieved.
Eighty-one had at least one follow-up visit. Of 46 re-exposed to malaria for a
variable period, 21 (46 %) had progressed, including 10/46 (22 %) evolving to
full-blown HMS, while of 29 patients not re-exposed, 24 (93 %) had improved or
cured and five (7 %) progressed (p < 0.001). At logistic regression re-exposure
was confirmed as a major risk factor of progression (OR 9.458, CI 1.767-50.616)
while treatment at initial visit was protective (OR 0.187, CI 0.054-0.650).
CONCLUSION: e-HMS should be regarded as a clinical condition predisposing to HMS.
Although the case definition may include false positives, e-HMS should be treated
just as the full-blown syndrome. A single anti-malarial treatment is probably
adequate, followed by effective prophylaxis for patients exposed again to malaria
transmission.

BACKGROUND: Motivated by the observation that children suffering from
undernutrition are more likely to experience disease and are more likely to die
if they do contract a disease, mathematical modelling is used to explore the
ramifications of targeting preventive disease measures to undernutritioned
children.
METHODS: A malaria model is constructed with superinfection and heterogeneous
susceptibility, where a portion of this susceptibility is due to undernutrition
(as measured by weight-for-age z scores); so as to isolate the impact of
supplementary food on malaria from the influence of confounding factors, the
portion of the total susceptibility that is due to undernutrition is estimated
from a large randomized trial of supplementary feeding. Logistic regression is
used to estimate mortality given malaria infection as a function of
weight-for-age z scores. The clinical malaria morbidity and malaria mortality are
analytically computed for a variety of policies involving supplementary food and 
insecticide-treated bed nets.
RESULTS: The portion of heterogeneity in susceptibility that is due to
undernutrition is estimated to be 90.3 %. Targeting insecticide-treated bed nets 
to undernutritioned children leads to fewer malaria deaths than the random
distribution of bed nets in the hypoendemic and mesoendemic settings. When
baseline bed net coverage for children is 20 %, supplementary food given to
underweight children is estimated to reduce malaria mortality by 7.2-22.9 % as
the entomological inoculation rate ranges from 500 to 1.0. In the hyperendemic
setting, supplementary food has a bigger impact than bed nets, particularly when 
baseline bed net coverage is high.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the results are speculative (e.g., they are based on
parameter estimates that do not possess the traditional statistical significance 
level), the biological plausibility of the modelling assumptions and the high
price-sensitivity of demand for bed nets suggest that free bed net distribution
targeted to undernutritioned children in areas suffering from both undernutrition
and malaria (e.g., sub-Saharan Africa) should be the subject of a randomized
trial in a hypoendemic or mesoendemic setting.

Estimating malaria burden in Nigeria: a geostatistical modelling approach.

Onyiri N(1).

Author information: 
(1)Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute, Basel. dozieonyiri@yahoo.co.uk.

This study has produced a map of malaria prevalence in Nigeria based on available
data from the Mapping Malaria Risk in Africa (MARA) database, including all
malaria prevalence surveys in Nigeria that could be geolocated, as well as data
collected during fieldwork in Nigeria between March and June 2007. Logistic
regression was fitted to malaria prevalence to identify significant demographic
(age) and environmental covariates in STATA. The following environmental
covariates were included in the spatial model: the normalized difference
vegetation index, the enhanced vegetation index, the leaf area index, the land
surface temperature for day and night, land use/landcover (LULC), distance to
water bodies, and rainfall. The spatial model created suggests that the two main 
environmental covariates correlating with malaria presence were land surface
temperature for day and rainfall. It was also found that malaria prevalence
increased with distance to water bodies up to 4 km. The malaria risk map
estimated from the spatial model shows that malaria prevalence in Nigeria varies 
from 20% in certain areas to 70% in others. The highest prevalence rates were
found in the Niger Delta states of Rivers and Bayelsa, the areas surrounding the 
confluence of the rivers Niger and Benue, and also isolated parts of the
north-eastern and north-western parts of the country. Isolated patches of low
malaria prevalence were found to be scattered around the country with northern
Nigeria having more such areas than the rest of the country. Nigeria's belt of
middle regions generally has malaria prevalence of 40% and above.

BACKGROUND: In Ethiopia, about 20,000 women die each year from complications of
pregnancy and child birth with many more maternal morbidities occurring for each 
maternal deaths. This makes Ethiopia one of the highest countries for maternal
deaths in the developing world. This study attempted to assess women's skilled
assistance seeking behaviour for pregnancy complications among those who gave
birth.
METHOD: A cross-sectional community based study was conducted among women who
gave birth within one year regardless of their delivery place. The study was
carried out in fifteen randomly selected villages at Arba Minch Zuria district,
south west Ethiopia. Data was collected house-to-house using a pretested Amharic 
questionnaire. During the survey, 798 women were interviewed. Logistic regression
model was applied to control confounders.
RESULTS: Out of the total sample, 344 (43.1 %) respondents reported at least any 
one of the pregnancy complications faced in the recent pregnancy. The most common
complications reported were malaria (57 %), nausea/vomiting (47.1 %) and severe
head ache (29.1 %). of those women who faced complications, around 254 (73.8 %)
sought assistance from a skilled provider. Ninety (26.2 %) of the respondents
sought assistance either from unskilled provider or home based self-care. Unable 
to understand the seriousness of the complications, thought as unnecessary, and
family disapproval were the major reasons for not seeking care from skilled
providers. Belonging to monthly household income $US25- 100 (AOR = 3.4, 95 % CI; 
1.04, 11.4), getting antenatal care from a skilled provider (AOR = 10.6, 95 % CI;
3.3, 34.5), Women in the age 20-34 years old (AOR = 3.8; 95 % CI, 1.2, 12.3),
Availability of transport access (AOR = 72.2; 95 % CI; 17.2, 303.5) were
significantly associated with seeking assistance from a skilled provider.
CONCLUSIONS: Nearly half (43.1 %) of the women had faced pregnancy complications 
to the recent birth of last one year. Majority (2/3(rd)) of the women who
reported complications sought skilled assistance. Family, income, transport issue
and antenatal care use were independent predictors for skilled assistance from
skilled provider.

BACKGROUND: The integrated Community Case Management (iCCM) of childhood
illnesses strategy has been adopted world over to reduce child related ill health
and mortality. Community Health workers (CHWs) who implement this strategy need a
regular supply of drugs to effectively treat children under 5 years with malaria,
pneumonia and diarrhea. In this paper, we report the prevalence and factors
influencing availability of medicines for managing malaria, pneumonia and
diarrhea in communities in central Uganda.
METHODS: A cross sectional study was conducted among 303 CHWs in Wakiso district 
in central Uganda. Eligible CHWs from two randomly selected Health Sub Districts 
(HSDs) were interviewed. Questionnaires, check lists, record reviews were used to
collect information on CHW background characteristics, CHW's prescription
behaviors, health system support factors and availability of iCCM drugs.
Multivariable logistic regression analysis was done to assess factors associated 
with availability of iCCM drugs.
RESULTS: Out of 300 CHWs, 239 (79.9%) were females and mean age was 42.1
(standard deviation =11.1 years). The prevalence of iCCM drug availability was
8.3% and 33 respondents (11%) had no drugs at all. Factors associated with iCCM
drug availability were; being supervised within the last month (adjusted
OR = 3.70, 95% CI 1.22-11.24), appropriate drug prescriptions (adjusted
OR = 3.71, 95% CI 1.38-9.96), regular submission of drug reports (adjusted
OR = 4.02, 95% CI 1.62-10.10) and having a respiratory timer as a diagnostic tool
(adjusted OR =3.11, 95% CI 1.08-9.00).
CONCLUSIONS: The low medicine stocks for the community management of childhood
illnesses calls for strengthening of CHW supervision, medicine prescription and
reporting, and increasing availability of functional diagnostic tools.

BACKGROUND: Chlorproguanil-dapsone (CD) has been linked to hemolysis in
symptomatic glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficient (G6PDd) children. Few
studies have explored the effects of G6PD status on hemolysis in children treated
with Intermittent Preventive Treatment in infants (IPTi) antimalarial regimens.
We sought to examine the joint effects of G6PD status and IPTi antimalarial
treatment on incidence of hemolysis in asymptomatic children treated with CD,
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), and mefloquine (MQ).
METHODS: A secondary analysis of data from a double-blind, placebo-controlled
trial of IPTi was conducted. Hemoglobin (Hb) measurements were made at IPTi
doses, regular follow-up and emergency visits. G6PD genotype was determined at 9 
months looking for SNPs for the A- genotype at coding position 202. Multivariable
linear and logistic regression models were used to examine hemolysis among
children with valid G6PD genotyping results. Hemolysis was defined as the
absolute change in Hb or as any post-dose Hb <8 g/dL. These outcomes were
assessed using either a single follow-up Hb on day 7 after an IPTi dose or Hb
obtained 1 to 14 or 28 days after each IPTi dose.
FINDINGS: Relative to placebo, CD reduced Hb by approximately 0.5 g/dL at day 7
and within 14 days of an IPTi dose, and by 0.2 g/dL within 28 days. Adjusted
declines in the CD group were larger than in the MQ and SP groups. At day 7,
homo-/hemizygous genotype was associated with higher odds of Hb <8 g/dL (adjusted
odds ratio = 6.7, 95% CI 1.7 to 27.0) and greater absolute reductions in Hb (-0.6
g/dL, 95% CI -1.1 to 0.003). There was no evidence to suggest increased
reductions in Hb among homo-/hemizygous children treated with CD compared to
placebo, SP or MQ.
CONCLUSIONS: While treatment with CD demonstrated greater reductions in Hb at 7
and 14 days after an IPTi dose compared to both SP and MQ, there was no evidence 
that G6PD deficiency exacerbated the adverse effects of CD, despite evidence for 
higher hemolysis risk among G6PDd infants.

BACKGROUND: The escalating level of mosquito resistance to pyrethroid
insecticides threatens the effectiveness of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) for
malaria control in Malawi. An evaluation of the effectiveness of ITNs for
preventing malaria in children aged 6-59 months old, after 1 year of mass
distribution of LLINs was conducted in Machinga District, Malawi, an area of
moderate pyrethroid resistance.
METHODS: A facility-based, case-control study among children 6-59 months was
conducted in an area of pyrethroid resistance between March and September 2013 in
Machinga District. Cases and controls were children with fever who sought care
from the same hospital and tested positive and negative, respectively, for
malaria parasites by microscopy.
RESULTS: A high proportion of both cases (354 of 404 or 87.6 %) and controls (660
of 778 or 84.8 %) slept under an ITN the night before the survey. In univariable 
logistic regression, older age (24-59 months versus 6-23 months, p < 0.001),
sleeping on the floor versus a mattress (p < 0.001), and open versus closed house
eaves (p = 0.001) were associated with increased odds of malaria, whilst
secondary education of the caretaker, having windows on multiple walls, and being
in the least poor wealth quintile (p < 0.001 for each) reduced the odds of
malaria; ITN use was not associated with malaria (p = 0.181). In multivariable
analysis, older age (p < 0.001) and secondary education of the caregiver (p =
0.011) were the only factors significantly associated with malaria.
CONCLUSION: This study did not find a significant personal protective effect of
ITNs. However, high use of ITNs in the community and recent findings of lower
malaria incidence in ITN users compared to bed net non-users from a cohort study 
in the same area suggest that ITNs provide community protection to both users and
non-users alike in this area.

Nowadays, the gold standard method for malaria diagnosis is a staining of thick
and thin blood film examined by expert laboratorists. It requires well-trained
laboratorists, which is a time consuming task, and is un-automated protocol. For 
this study, Maladiag Software was developed to predict malaria infection in
suspected malaria patients. The demographic data of patients, examination for
malaria parasites, and complete blood count (CBC) profiles were analyzed. Binary 
logistic regression was used to create the equation for the malaria diagnosis.
The diagnostic parameters of the equation were tested on 4,985 samples (703
infected and 4,282 control samples). The equation indicated 81.2% sensitivity and
80.3% specificity for predicting infection of malaria. The positive likelihood
and negative likelihood ratio were 4.12 (95% CI = 4.01-4.23) and 0.23 (95%
CI = 0.22-0.25), respectively. This parameter also had odds ratios (P
value < 0.0001, OR = 17.6, 95% CI = 16.0-19.3). The equation can predict malaria 
infection after adjust for age, gender, nationality, monocyte (%), platelet
count, neutrophil (%), lymphocyte (%), and the RBC count of patients. The
diagnostic accuracy was 0.877 (Area under curve, AUC) (95% CI = 0.871-0.883). The
system, when used in combination with other clinical and microscopy methods,
might improve malaria diagnoses and enhance prompt treatment.

BACKGROUND: Logistic regression is a statistical model widely used in
cross-sectional and cohort studies to identify and quantify the effects of
potential disease risk factors. However, the impact of imperfect tests on
adjusted odds ratios (and thus on the identification of risk factors) is
under-appreciated. The purpose of this article is to draw attention to the
problem associated with modelling imperfect diagnostic tests, and propose simple 
Bayesian models to adequately address this issue.
METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted to determine the proportion
of malaria studies that appropriately accounted for
false-negatives/false-positives in a logistic regression setting. Inference from 
the standard logistic regression was also compared with that from three proposed 
Bayesian models using simulations and malaria data from the western Brazilian
Amazon.
RESULTS: A systematic literature review suggests that malaria epidemiologists are
largely unaware of the problem of using logistic regression to model imperfect
diagnostic test results. Simulation results reveal that statistical inference can
be substantially improved when using the proposed Bayesian models versus the
standard logistic regression. Finally, analysis of original malaria data with one
of the proposed Bayesian models reveals that microscopy sensitivity is strongly
influenced by how long people have lived in the study region, and an important
risk factor (i.e., participation in forest extractivism) is identified that would
have been missed by standard logistic regression.
CONCLUSION: Given the numerous diagnostic methods employed by malaria researchers
and the ubiquitous use of logistic regression to model the results of these
diagnostic tests, this paper provides critical guidelines to improve data
analysis practice in the presence of misclassification error. Easy-to-use code
that can be readily adapted to WinBUGS is provided, enabling straightforward
implementation of the proposed Bayesian models.

In 2010, at the same time as the national roll out of the Free Health Care
Initiative (FHCI), which removed user fees for facility based health care,
trained community health volunteers (CHVs) were deployed to provide integrated
community case management of diarrhea, malaria and pneumonia to children under 5 
years of age (U5) in Kambia and Pujehun districts, Sierra Leone. After 2 years of
implementation and in the context of FHCI, CHV utilization rate was 14.0 %. In
this study, we examine the factors associated with this level of CHV utilization.
A cross-sectional household-cluster survey of 1590 caregivers of 2279 children U5
was conducted in 2012; with CHV utilization assessed using a multiple logistic
regression model. Focus groups and in-depth interviews were also conducted to
understand communities' experiences with CHVs. Children with diarrhea (OR = 3.17,
95 % CI: 1.17-8.60), from female-headed households (OR = 4.55, 95 % CI:
1.88-11.00), and whose caregivers reported poor quality of care as a barrier to
facility care-seeking (OR = 8.53, 95 % CI: 3.13-23.16) were more likely to
receive treatment from a CHV. Despite low utilization, caregivers were highly
familiar and appreciative of CHVs, but were concerned about the lack of financial
remuneration for CHVs. CHVs remained an important source of care for children
from female-headed households and whose caregivers reported poor quality of care 
at health facilities. CHVs are an important strategy for certain populations even
when facility utilization is high or when facility services are compromised, as
has happened with the recent Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone.

Malaria is a disease that generates a broad spectrum of clinical features. The
purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical spectrum of malaria in
semi-immune populations. Patients were recruited in Mâncio Lima, a city situated 
in the Brazilian Amazon region. The study included 171 malaria cases, which were 
diagnosed via the use of a thick blood smear and confirmed by molecular methods. 
A questionnaire addressing 19 common symptoms was administered to all patients.
Multiple correspondence analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis were performed
to identify clusters of symptoms, and logistic regression was used to identify
factors associated with the occurrence of symptoms. The cluster analysis revealed
five groups of symptoms: the first cluster, which included algic- and
fever-related symptoms, occurred in up to 95.3% of the cases. The second cluster,
which comprised gastric symptoms (nausea, abdominal pain, inappetence, and bitter
mouth), occurred in frequencies that ranged between 35.1% and 42.7%, and at least
one of these symptoms was observed in 71.9% of the subjects. All respiratory
symptoms were clustered and occurred in 42.7% of the malaria cases, and diarrhea 
occurred in 9.9% of the cases. Symptoms constituting the fifth cluster were
vomiting and pallor, with a 14.6% and 11.7% of prevalence, respectively. A higher
parasitemia count (more than 300 parasites/mm(3)) was associated with the
presence of fever, vomiting, dizziness, and weakness (P < 0.05). Arthralgia and
myalgia were associated with patients over the age of 14 years (P < 0.001).
Having experienced at least eight malaria episodes prior to the study was
associated with a decreased risk of chills and fever and an increased risk of
sore throat (P < 0.05). None of the symptoms showed an association with gender or
with species of Plasmodium. The clinical spectrum of malaria in semi-immune
individuals can have a broad range of symptoms, the frequency and intensity of
which are associated with age, past exposure to malaria, and parasitemia.
Understanding the full spectrum of nonsevere malaria is important in endemic
areas to guide both passive and active case detection, for the diagnosis of
malaria in travelers returning to non-endemic areas, and for the development of
vaccines aimed to decrease symptom severity.

The complexity of sickness among Kenya's urban poor cannot be dissociated from
how social and health problems become syndemic. Increasingly diabetes and other
non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are emerging among low-income populations that
also are most afflicted by social stress and infection. This article examines how
social stress, psychological distress, and physical illness among patients in a
public hospital in Nairobi, Kenya, produce syndemic suffering, defined by lived
experiences of syndemic clustering such as diabetes with depression and
infection. We recruited 100 urban public hospital patients, of which half were
women, and half had type 2 diabetes from June to August 2014. We administered
written informed consent and collected anthropometrics and blood samples before
we conducted lengthy mixed qualitative and survey interviews. We analyzed social 
stress in narrative interviews using content analysis and evaluated social and
physical contributors to mental distress with frequency tables and logistic
regression. We found that people experienced diabetes through a complex social
and medical framework, where social problems were cause and consequence to
psychological and physical suffering. Women's narratives revealed more social
suffering as well as more mental distress and somatic symptoms, including
multi-morbidities, than men's. People with diabetes reported not only concurrent 
anxiety and depression but also common infections, including malaria,
tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS. Narratives reveal how NCDs concurrent with
infections, and HIV in particular, produce financial challenges for patients,
especially when HIV treatment is free and patients must pay out-of-pocket for
diabetes care. Future studies should investigate syndemic clustering of
infections and NCDs among low-income populations at the population-level.

BACKGROUND: Primates are important reservoirs for human diseases, but their
infection status and disease dynamics are difficult to track in the wild. Within 
the last decade, a macaque malaria, Plasmodium knowlesi, has caused disease in
hundreds of humans in Southeast Asia. In order to track cases and understand
zoonotic risk, it is imperative to be able to quantify infection status in
reservoir macaque species. In this study, protocols for the collection of
non-invasive samples and isolation of malaria parasites from naturally infected
macaques are optimized.
METHODS: Paired faecal and blood samples from 60 Macaca fascicularis and four
Macaca nemestrina were collected. All animals came from Sumatra or Java and were 
housed in semi-captive breeding colonies around West Java. DNA was extracted from
samples using a modified protocol. Nested polymerase chain reactions (PCR) were
run to detect Plasmodium using primers targeting mitochondrial DNA. Sensitivity
of screening faecal samples for Plasmodium was compared to other studies using
Kruskal Wallis tests and logistic regression models.
RESULTS: The best primer set was 96.7 % (95 % confidence intervals (CI):
83.3-99.4 %) sensitive for detecting Plasmodium in faecal samples of naturally
infected macaques (n = 30). This is the first study to produce definitive
estimates of Plasmodium sensitivity and specificity in faecal samples from
naturally infected hosts. The sensitivity was significantly higher than some
other studies involving wild primates.
CONCLUSIONS: Faecal samples can be used for detection of malaria infection in
field surveys of macaques, even when there are no parasites visible in thin blood
smears. Repeating samples from individuals will improve inferences of the
epidemiology of malaria in wild primates.

High Incidence of Malaria Along the Sino-Burmese Border Is Associated With
Polymorphisms of CR1, IL-1A, IL-4R, IL-4, NOS, and TNF, But Not With G6PD
Deficiency.

Malaria is highly endemic in Yunnan Province, China, with the incidence of
malaria being highest along the Sino-Burmese border. The aim of our study was to 
determine whether genetic polymorphisms are associated with the prevalence of
malaria among Chinese residents of the Sino-Burmese border region. Fourteen
otherwise healthy people with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)
deficiency, 50 malaria patients, and 67 healthy control subjects were included in
our cross-sectional study. We analyzed the frequency of the G3093T and T520C
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of CR1. Logistic regression was used to
calculate the prevalence odds ratio (POR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of
malaria for the T520C SNP of CR1 and SNPs of G6PD, IL-4, IL-4R, IL-1A, NOS,
CD40LG, TNF, and LUC7L. The frequency of the 3093T/3093T genotype of CR1 in the
malaria group (0.16) was significantly higher than that in the control group
(0.045, P < 0.05), and significantly lower than that in the G6PD deficiency group
(0.43, P < 0.01). The frequency of the 520T/520T genotype of CR1 was
significantly higher in the malaria patients (0.78) than that in the control
group (0.67, P < 0.05) and G6PD-deficiency group (0.36, P < 0.05). The T allele
of the T520C variant of CR1 was significantly associated with the prevalence of
malaria (POR: 1.460; 95% CI: 0.703-3.034). Polymorphisms of G6PD did not
significantly influence the prevalence malaria (P > 0.05). A GTGTGTC haplotype
consisting of IL-1A (rs17561), IL-4 (rs2243250), TNF (rs1800750), IL-4R
(rs1805015), NOS (rs8078340), CD40LG (rs1126535), and LUC7L (rs1211375) was
significantly associated with the prevalence of malaria (POR: 1.822, 95% CI:
0.998-3.324). The 3093G/3093G and 520T/520T genotypes are the predominant genetic
variants of CR1 among Chinese residents near the Sino-Burmese border, and the T
allele of T520C is associated with the prevalence of malaria in this region.
Although G6PD deficiency does not protect against malaria, it may diminish the
association between malaria and the CR1 polymorphisms in this population. The
GTGTGTC haplotype is also associated with the prevalence of malaria in this
region.

INTRODUCTION: Malaria, pneumonia and diarrhoea are leading causes of death in
young children in Uganda. In 2010, Integrated Community Case Management (ICCM)
was adopted in Uganda for community level diagnosis and treatment of these
diseases through community health workers. However, 50-60% of sick children will 
receive treatment from the private sector, especially drug shops. Only about half
of drug shops are licensed and the quality of care is poor. There is an urgent
need to improve quality of care and regulation of drug shops in Uganda.
METHODS: This is a pre-post cross-sectional study with before and after
measurement in an intervention area in Kamujli district. A snowball mapping
exercise, exit interviews, focus group discussions and interviews will be used.
25 randomly selected drug shops will be selected for an intervention that will
assist drug shops to become licensed, and provide five days of ICCM training,
subsidised prepackaged medicines (artemisinin-based combination therapies for
malaria, amoxicillin for pneumonia, Oral Rehydration Salts/zinc for diarrhoea)
and free diagnostic tools (rapid diagnostic tests, respiratory timers,
thermometers, algorithms). We anticipate a sample size of 1200 (600 at baseline
and 600 at the end of the study).
ANALYSIS: Quantitative data will be analysed using SPSS for proportions and CIs. 
Bivariate and multiple logistic regression analysis with adjustment for
clustering of data will be performed to adjust for confounding and determine
intervention effect. Qualitative data will be entered into NVivo 10 and analysed 
using content analysis.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Research ethics approval is received from the
University of Calgary (REB 14-0269), and Makerere University (IRB00011353).
Findings from this study will be disseminated through journal articles and
conference presentations, and will illustrate the feasibility of introducing ICCM
for drug shops.

BACKGROUND: Universal long-lasting insecticidal net (LLIN) coverage (ULC) has
reduced malaria morbidity and mortality across Africa. Although information is
available on bed net use in specific groups, such as pregnant women and children 
under 5 years, there is paucity of data on their use among the general
population. Bed net source, ownership and determinants of use among individuals
from households in an eastern Rwanda community 8 months after a ULC were
characterized.
METHODS: Using household-based, interviewer-administered questionnaires and
interviewer-direct observations, data on bed net source, ownership and key
determinants of net use, including demographics, socio-economic status
indicators, house structure characteristics, as well as of bed net quantity, type
and integrity, were collected from 1400 randomly selected households. Univariate 
and mixed effects logistic regression modelling was done to assess for
determinants of bed net use.
RESULTS: A total of 1410 households and 6598 individuals were included in the
study. Overall, the proportion of households with at least one net was 92 % while
bed net usage was reported among 72 % of household members. Of the households
surveyed, a total ownership of 2768 nets was reported, of which about 96 % were
reportedly LLINs received from the ULC. By interviewer-physical observation, 88 %
of the nets owned were of the LLIN type with the remaining 12 % did not carry any
mark to enable type recognition. The odds of bed net use were significantly lower
among males and individuals: from households of low socio-economic status, from
households with <two bed nets, from households reporting use of ≥two sleeping
spaces, and those reporting to have not slept on a bed.
CONCLUSION: In this study, despite high a bed net coverage, over 25 % of members 
reported not to have slept under a bed net the night before the survey. Males
were particularly less likely to use bed nets even where nets were available.
Household socio-economic status, number of bed nets and type and number of
sleeping spaces were key determinants of bed net use. To maximize impact of ULC, 
strategies that target males as well as those that ensure ITN coverage for all,
address barriers to feasible and convenient bed net use including covering over
all sleeping space types, and provide net hanging supports, are needed.

BACKGROUND: Acute seizures are a common cause of paediatric admissions to
hospitals in Africa, and malaria is an important cause of seizures in endemic
areas. Malaria has declined in the past decade whilst neonatal admissions have
increased, both which may affect the incidence and phenotypes of acute seizures
in African children.
METHODS: We examined the effect of recent decline in malaria and the increasing
burden of neonatal admissions on the incidence, causes and phenotypes of acute
seizures admitted to hospital from 2009-2013. We used logistic regression to
measure associations and Poisson regression to calculate the incidence and rate
ratios.
RESULTS: The overall incidence of acute seizures over the 5-year period was 312
per 100,000/year (95% CI, 295-329): 116 per 100,000/year (95% CI, 106-127) for
complex seizures and 443 per 100,000 live births (95% CI, 383-512) for neonatal
seizures. Over the period, there was an increase in incidence of
seizures-attributable to malaria (SAM) (incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 1.25; p <
0.001), but neither non-SAM (IRR = 1.03; p = 0.569) nor neonatal seizures (IRR = 
0.99; p = 0.905). Important causes of acute seizures were malaria (33%) and
respiratory tract infections (19%); and for neonatal seizures were neonatal
sepsis (51%), hypoglycemia (41%) and hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (21%).
Mortality occurred in 6% of all acute seizures, being more common in complex
seizures (8%) and neonatal seizures (10 %) than other seizures (p < 0.001 for
both comparisons).
CONCLUSIONS: Acute seizures remain common in children despite a decline in the
incidence of malaria; suggesting that causes for these seizures need to be
prevented in the community.

Millions of long-lasting insecticide treated nets (LLINs) have been distributed
as part of the global malaria control strategy. LLIN ownership, however, does not
necessarily guarantee use. Thus, even in the ideal setting in which universal
coverage with LLINs has been achieved, maximal malaria protection will only be
achieved if LLINs are used both correctly and consistently. This study
investigated the factors associated with net use, independent of net ownership.
Data were collected during a household survey conducted in Ebonyi State in
southeastern Nigeria in November 2011 following a statewide mass LLIN
distribution campaign and, in select locations, a community-based social behavior
change (SBC) intervention. Logistic regression analyses, controlling for
household bed net ownership, were conducted to examine the association between
individual net use and various demographic, environmental, behavioral and social 
factors. The odds of net use increased among individuals who were exposed to
tailored SBC in the context of a home visit (OR = 17.11; 95% CI 4.45-65.79) or
who received greater degrees of social support from friends and family (ptrend < 
0.001). Factors associated with decreased odds of net use included: increasing
education level (ptrend = 0.020), increasing malaria knowledge level (ptrend =
0.022), and reporting any disadvantage of bed nets (OR = 0.39; 95% CI 0.23-0.78).
The findings suggest that LLIN use is significantly influenced by social support 
and exposure to a malaria-related SBC home visit. The malaria community should
thus further consider the importance of community outreach, interpersonal
communication and social support on adoption of net use behaviors when designing 
future research and interventions.

♦BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) in P. falciparum malaria infection is an
important morbidity in children. The purpose of the present study was done to
observe the renal involvement, associated morbidities and outcome. ♦
METHODS: Out of 156 patients with severe P. falciparum malaria, diagnosed on the 
basis of compatible clinical presentations and positive malarial parasites in the
peripheral blood smear and/or histidine rich protein 2 antigen, 31 had AKI at
presentation and were analyzed. ♦
RESULTS: Of 31 (19.9%) patients with AKI, 4 were classified at risk, 11 injury,
and 16 failure stage, as per pRIFLE criteria (pediatric version of RIFLE [R =
risk, I = injury, F = failure, L = loss E = end-stage kidney disease]). Mean age 
of children with AKI was 7.7 ± 3.2 years. A significantly higher proportion of
patients with AKI had hypoglycemia (41.9%), pulmonary edema (32.2%), and
disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (29.0%) compared to those without
AKI (18.4%, 4.8%, and 3.2%, respectively). Twelve patients (38.7%) required
peritoneal dialysis (PD), 8 (25.8%) died, and all were in failure stage. The
non-survivors had significantly higher blood urea (p = 0.005) and serum
creatinine levels (p = 0.042), lower glomerular filtration rate (p < 0.001),
longer duration of illness (p = 0.003), and oliguria/anuria (p = 0.001) than
survivors at admission. On logistic regression analysis, the disseminated
intravascular coagulation (DIC), jaundice and parasite density (≥ 3+) were found 
to be significant factors contributing to mortality in children with AKI. ♦
CONCLUSIONS: Acute kidney injury in falciparum malaria is one of the severe
systemic complications. Duration of illness and presence of comorbidities
adversely affected the outcome.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the relative contribution of malaria and other potential
determinants to current anaemia prevalence in Rwanda.
METHODS: The database for this study was the Rwanda Demographic and Health Survey
2010. Haemoglobin and malaria test results, and additional exposures ascertained 
through mothers' interviews, were analysed for all eligible children age 6-59
months (n = 4068), in addition to diet data available for the youngest under
5-year-old per household. We examined anaemia-exposure associations through
forward logistic regression, first for the overall population (n = 3685), and
second, for the subpopulation with diet data (n = 1934).
RESULTS: In the overall study population, malaria was strongly associated with
anaemia (OR = 6.83, 95% CI: 2.90-16.05), but population impact was modest
(population-attributable fraction = 2.5%). Factors associated with lower odds of 
anaemia were recent de-worming medication (six months; OR = 0.60, 95% CI:
0.49-0.74), female sex (OR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.66-0.87), increasing age, residence 
in North Province and educated mother. Being underweight and recent fever (two
weeks) were associated with higher odds. In the subpopulation with diet data,
odds were lower with consumption of vitamin A-rich foods (OR = 0.66, 95% CI:
0.50-0.88); and higher in households with many young children.
CONCLUSIONS: Malaria remains a strong determinant of anaemia for the individual
child: transmission control efforts must be maintained. At population level, to
further reduce anaemia prevalence, promoting regular vitamin A intake from
natural sources and reducing intestinal helminths burden appear the most
promising strategies to explore; exploring potential hitherto unidentified
sex-linked factors is warranted.

BACKGROUND: Malaria continues to be a major health problem in low-income
countries. Consequently, malaria control remains a public health priority in
endemic countries such as Zambia. Pregnant women and children under 5 years of
age are among groups at high risk of malaria infection. Malaria infection is
associated with adverse birth outcomes that affect the mother, foetus, and
infant. Infection with HIV has been shown to increase the risk of malaria
infection in pregnancy. The prevalence and the predictors of malaria infection
among pregnant women resident in the Nchelenge District of northern Zambia were
investigated.
METHODS: Between November 2013 and April 2014, pregnant women in the catchment
areas of two health centres were recruited during their first antenatal care
visit. HIV testing was conducted as part of routine care. In addition, blood
samples were collected from 1086 participants and tested for malaria infection
using standard microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques specific
for Plasmodium falciparum. Multivariate logistic regression were conducted to
examine the predictors of malaria infection.
RESULTS: The prevalence of malaria identified by microscopy was 31.8 % (95 %
confidence intervals [CI], 29.0-34.5; N = 1079) and by PCR was 57.8 % (95 % CI,
54.9-60.8; N = 1074). HIV infection was 13.2 % among women on their first
antenatal visit; the prevalence of malaria detected by PCR among HIV-uninfected
and HIV-infected women was 56.7 % (531/936) and 65.2 % (90/138), respectively. In
the final model, the risk of malaria infection was 81 % higher among pregnant
women recruited from Nchelenge health centre compared to those attending the
Kashikishi health centre (adjusted odds ratio = 1.81; 95 % CI, 1.38-2.37,
P < 0.001), and HIV-infected women across health centres had a 46 % greater risk 
of malaria infection compared to HIV-uninfected women (adjusted odds
ratio = 1.46; 95 %, 1.00-2.13, P = 0.045).
CONCLUSION: High burden of malaria detected by PCR in these pregnant women
suggests that past prevention efforts have had limited effect. To reduce this
burden of malaria sustainably, there is clear need to strengthen existing
interventions and, possibly, to change approaches so as to improve targeting of
groups most affected by malaria.

BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Cerebral malaria is considered a leading cause of
neuro-disability in sub-Saharan Africa among children and about 25% of survivors 
have long-term neurological and cognitive deficits or epilepsy. Their development
was reported to be associated with protracted seizures, deep and prolonged coma. 
The study was aimed to determine the discharge pattern and to identify potential 
and informative predictors of neurological sequelae at discharge, complicating
childhood cerebral malaria in central Sudan.
METHODS: A cross-sectional prospective study was carried out during malaria
transmission seasons from 2000 to 2004 in Wad Medani, Sinnar and Singa hospitals,
central Sudan. Children suspected of having cerebral malaria were examined and
diagnosed by a Pediatrician for clinical, laboratory findings and any
neurological complications. Univariate and multiple regression model analysis
were performed to evaluate the association of clinical and laboratory findings
with occurrence of neurological complications using the SPSS.
RESULTS: Out of 940 examined children, only 409 were diagnosed with cerebral
malaria with a mean age of 6.1 ± 3.3 yr. The mortality rate associated with the
study was 14.2% (58) and 18.2% (64) of survivors (351) had neurological sequelae.
Abnormal posture, either decerebration or decortication, focal convulsion and
coma duration of >48 h were significant predictors for surviving from cerebral
malaria with a neurological sequelae in children from central Sudan by Univariate
analysis. Multiple logistic regression model fitting these variables, revealed
39.6% sensitivity for prediction of childhood cerebral malaria survivors with
neurological sequelae (R² = 0.396; p=0.001).
INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Neurological sequelae are common due to childhood
cerebral malaria in central Sudan. Their prediction at admission, clinical
presentation and laboratory findings may guide clinical intervention and proper
management that may decrease morbidity and improve CM consequences.

BACKGROUND: Systemic bacterial infections are a major cause of paediatric febrile
illness in sub-Saharan Africa. Aim of this study was to assess the effects of
social and geographical determinants on the risk of bacteraemia in a rural-urban 
transition zone in Ghana.
METHODS: Children below 15 years of age with fever were recruited at an
outpatient department in the suburban belt of Kumasi, Ghana's second largest
city. Blood was taken for bacterial culture and malaria diagnostics. The
socio-economic status of participants was calculated using Principle Component
Analysis. A scale, based on key urban characteristics, was established to
quantify urbanicity for all communities in the hospital catchment area. A
case-control analysis was conducted, where children with and without bacteraemia 
were cases and controls, respectively.
RESULTS: Bacteraemia was detected in 72 (3.1%) of 2,306 hospital visits.
Non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS; n = 24; 33.3%) and Salmonella typhi (n = 18;
25.0%) were the most common isolates. Logistic regression analysis showed that
bacteraemia was negatively associated with urbanicity (odds ratio [OR] = 0.8; 95%
confidence interval [CI]: 0.7-1.0) and socio-economic status (OR = 0.8; 95% CI:
0.6-0.9). Both associations were stronger if only NTS infections were used as
cases (OR = 0.5; 95% CI: 0.3-0.8 and OR = 0.6; 95% CI: 0.4-1.0, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study highlight the importance of individual as 
well as community factors as independent risk factors for invasive bacterial
infection (IBI) and especially NTS. Epidemiological data support physicians,
public health experts and policy makers to identify disease prevention and
treatment needs in order to secure public health in the transitional societies of
developing countries.

Malaria risk maps may be used to guide policy decisions on whether vector control
interventions should be targeted and, if so, where. Active surveillance for
malaria was conducted through household surveys in Nchelenge District, Zambia
from April 2012 through December 2014. Households were enumerated based on
satellite imagery and randomly selected for study enrollment. At each visit,
participants were administered a questionnaire and a malaria rapid diagnostic
test (RDT). Logistic regression models were used to construct spatial prediction 
risk maps and maps of risk uncertainty. A total of 461 households were visited,
comprising 1,725 participants, of whom 48% were RDT positive. Several
environmental features were associated with increased household malaria risk in a
multivariable logistic regression model adjusting for seasonal variation. The
model was validated using both internal and external evaluation measures to
generate and assess root mean square error, as well as sensitivity and
specificity for predicted risk. The final, validated model was used to predict
and map malaria risk including a measure of risk uncertainty. Malaria risk in a
high, perennial transmission setting is widespread but heterogeneous at a local
scale, with seasonal variation. Targeting malaria control interventions may not
be appropriate in this epidemiological setting.

BACKGROUND: Sub-Saharan Africa is expected to show the greatest rates of
urbanization over the next 50 years. Urbanization has shown a substantial impact 
in reducing malaria transmission due to multiple factors, including unfavourable 
habitats for Anopheles mosquitoes, generally healthier human populations, better 
access to healthcare, and higher housing standards. Statistical relationships
have been explored at global and local scales, but generally only examining the
effects of urbanization on single malaria metrics. In this study, associations
between multiple measures of urbanization and a variety of malaria metrics were
estimated at local scales.
METHODS: Cohorts of children and adults from 100 households across each of three 
contrasting sub-counties of Uganda (Walukuba, Nagongera and Kihihi) were followed
for 24 months. Measures of urbanicity included density of surrounding households,
vegetation index, satellite-derived night-time lights, land cover, and a
composite urbanicity score. Malaria metrics included the household density of
mosquitoes (number of female Anopheles mosquitoes captured), parasite prevalence 
and malaria incidence. Associations between measures of urbanicity and malaria
metrics were made using negative binomial and logistic regression models.
RESULTS: One site (Walukuba) had significantly higher urbanicity measures
compared to the two rural sites. In Walukuba, all individual measures of higher
urbanicity were significantly associated with a lower household density of
mosquitoes. The higher composite urbanicity score in Walukuba was also associated
with a lower household density of mosquitoes (incidence rate ratio = 0.28, 95 %
CI 0.17-0.48, p < 0.001) and a lower parasite prevalence (odds ratio, OR = 0.44, 
CI 0.20-0.97, p = 0.04). In one rural site (Kihihi), only a higher density of
surrounding households was associated with a lower parasite prevalence
(OR = 0.15, CI 0.07-0.34, p < 0.001). And, in only one rural site (Nagongera) was
living where NDVI ≤0.45 associated with higher incidence of malaria (IRR = 1.35, 
CI 1.35-1.70, p = 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Urbanicity has been shown previously to lead to a reduction in
malaria transmission at large spatial scales. At finer scales, individual
household measures of higher urbanicity were associated with lower mosquito
densities and parasite prevalence only in the site that was generally
characterized as being urban. The approaches outlined here can help better
characterize urbanicity at the household level and improve targeting of control
interventions.

BACKGROUND: Although, malaria control interventions are widely implemented to
eliminate malaria disease, malaria is still a public health problem in Tanzania. 
Understanding the risk factors, spatial and space-time clustering for malaria
deaths is essential for targeting malaria interventions and effective control
measures. In this study, spatial methods were used to identify local malaria
mortality clustering using verbal autopsy data.
METHODS: The analysis used longitudinal data collected in Rufiji and Ifakara
Health Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) sites for the period 1999-2011 and 
2002-2012, respectively. Two models were used. The first was a non-spatial model 
where logistic regression was used to determine a household's characteristic or
an individual's risk of malaria deaths. The second was a spatial Poisson model
applied to estimate spatial clustering of malaria mortality using SaTScan™, with 
age as a covariate. ArcGIS Geographical Information System software was used to
map the estimates obtained to show clustering and the variations related to
malaria mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 11,462 deaths in 33 villages and 9328 deaths in 25 villages
in Rufiji and Ifakara HDSS, respectively were recorded. Overall, 2699 (24 %) of
the malaria deaths in Rufiji and 1596 (17.1 %) in Ifakara were recorded during
the study period. Children under five had higher odds of dying from malaria
compared with their elderly counterparts aged five and above for Rufiji
(AOR = 2.05, 95 % CI = 1.87-2.25), and Ifakara (AOR = 2.33, 95 % CI = 2.05-2.66),
respectively. In addition, ownership of mosquito net had a protective effect
against dying with malaria in both HDSS sites. Moreover, villages with
consistently significant malaria mortality clusters were detected in both HDSS
sites during the study period.
CONCLUSIONS: Clustering of malaria mortality indicates heterogeneity in risk.
Improving targeted malaria control and treatment interventions to high risk
clusters may lead to the reduction of malaria deaths at the household and
probably at country level. Furthermore, ownership of mosquito nets and age
appeared to be important predictors for malaria deaths.

BACKGROUND: With malaria declining, other causes of fever may account for a
substantial portion of severe childhood illness in sub-Saharan Africa. We
determined prevalence, etiologies, and correlates of bacteremia among children in
Western Kenya.
METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, febrile children aged 6 months to 15 years
presenting to Kisii (low malaria endemicity) and Homabay (high malaria
endemicity) Hospitals were enrolled and screened for malaria, human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and bacteremia. Correlates of bacteremia
were evaluated using logistic regression.
RESULTS: Among 1476 children enrolled, 48 (3.3%) had bacteremia (23 of 734, 3.1% 
in Kisii and 25 of 734, 3.4% in Homabay). Salmonella spp (19 typhi and 21
nontyphoidal salmonella) accounted for 83% (40 of 48) of isolates. The
distribution of Salmonella spp was similar between sites. Bacteremia was
associated with incomplete vaccination (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.1; 95%
confidence interval [CI], 1.1-4.1), before treatment with antimalarials (aOR =
2.7; 95% CI, 1.4-4.1), having sought care elsewhere (aOR = 2.2; 95% CI, 1.2-4.0) 
and lower education of caregiver (aOR = 2.5; 95% CI, 1.1-4.8). Nontyphoidal
salmonella bacteremia was associated with HIV (aOR = 6.8; 95% CI, 1.1-35.1) and
anemia (hemoglobin <8 g/dL) (aOR = 5.2; 95% CI, 1.4-18.9).
CONCLUSIONS: Bacteremia was relatively uncommon, but children with HIV, anemia,
incomplete vaccination, and/or persistent fever despite malaria treatment may
have higher risk and may benefit from targeted bacterial culture and/or empiric
antibiotic therapy.

INTRODUCTION: Iron deficiency is a major public health concern. Globally, iron
deficiency ranks number 9 and is responsible for about 60% of all anemia cases
among preschool children. In Africa iron deficiency is 43-52% while in Kenya,
children under 5 years constitute the largest burden with 69% of them being
deficient. There is limited iron deficiency data in Kenya. This study determined 
haemoglobin levels, serum ferritin levels, nutritional status and P.falciparum
malaria infection in preschool children.
METHODS: A household cross sectional study was undertaken among 125 preschoolers 
in Western province, drawn from 37 clusters. Systematic random sampling was used 
for sample selection. Data was collected using pretested structured
questionnaires, entered in Microsoft package. Data analysis was done in
Statistical package for social science (SPSS) version 20 using bivariate and
multivariate logistic regression and differences were considered significant at P
< 0.05.
RESULTS: The prevalence of iron deficiency (Serum ferritin <12mg/l), anaemia (Hb 
< 110g/l) and plasmodium falciparum malaria were 20.8%, 25% and 6.8%
respectively. There was a significant association between iron deficiency and
anaemia (OR = 3.43, 95% CI: 1.33-8.84, p = 0.008). A preschool child with anaemia
was 3.43 times likely to be iron deficient compared to a preschool child who was 
not anaemic.
CONCLUSION: Iron deficiency, anaemia and plasmodium falciparum malaria was
prevalent among preschool children. The findings revealed a significant
association between iron deficiency and anaemia. Therefore effective
interventions to improve iron status will have large health benefits by greatly
reducing anaemia in preschool children.

BACKGROUND: In 2004, Ghana implemented the artemisinin-based combination therapy 
(ACT) policy. Health worker (HW) adherence to the national malaria guidelines on 
case-management with ACT for children below 5 years of age and older patients
presenting at health facilities (HF) for primary illness consultations was
evaluated 5 years post-ACT policy change.
METHODS: Cross-sectional surveys were conducted from 2010 to 2011 at HFs that
provide curative care as part of outpatient activities in two districts located
in the middle belt of Ghana to coincide with the periods of low and high malaria 
transmission seasons. A review of patient medical records, HW interviews, HF
inventories and finger-pricked blood obtained for independent malaria microscopy 
were used to assess HW practices on malaria case-management.
RESULTS: Data from 130 HW interviews, 769 patient medical records at 20 HFs over 
75 survey days were individually linked and evaluated. The majority of
consultations were performed at health centres/clinics (68.3 %) by medical
assistants (28.6 %) and nurse aids (23.5 %). About 68.4 % of HWs had received
ACT-specific training and 51.9 %, supervisory visits in the preceding 6 months.
Despite the availability of malaria diagnostic test at most HFs (94 %), only 39.8
% (241) out of 605 (78.7 %) patients who reported fever were investigated for
malaria. Treatment with ACT in line with the guidelines was 66.7 %; higher in <5 
children compared to patients ≥5 years old. Judged against reference microscopy, 
only 44.8 % (107/239) of ACT prescriptions that conformed to the guidelines were 
"truly malaria". Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that HW were
significantly more likely to comply with the guidelines if treatment were by low 
cadre of health staff, were for children below 5 years of age, and malaria test
was performed.
CONCLUSION: Although the majority of patients presenting with malaria received
treatment according to the national malaria guidelines, there were widespread
inappropriate treatment with ACT. Compliance with the guidelines on ACT use was
low, 5 years post-ACT policy change. The Ghana NMCP needs to strengthen HW
capacity on malaria case-management through regular training supported by
effective laboratory quality control measures.

BACKGROUND: Clinical trials of the RTS,S malaria vaccine have completed Phase III
and the vaccine is on track for registration. Before making decisions about
implementation, it is essential to prepare the ground for introducing the vaccine
by assessing awareness and willingness to use malaria vaccines and to provide
policy makers with evidence-based information on the best strategies to engage
communities to manage the introduction of malaria vaccine in Tanzania.
METHODS: In November 2011, as part of a large cross-sectional study of all 23
regions of Tanzania (mainland Tanzania and Zanzibar) was conducted during
Tanzanian Integrated Measles Campaign (IMC) survey. In this study, the variables 
of interests were awareness and willingness to use a malaria vaccine. The main
outcome measure was willingness to use a malaria vaccine. Logistic regression was
used to examine the influence of predictive factors.
RESULTS: A representative sample of 5502 (out of 6210) women, aged 18 years or
older and with children under 11 months old, was selected to participate, using
random sampling probability. Awareness of the forthcoming malaria vaccine, 11.8 %
of participants in mainland Tanzania responded affirmatively, compared to 3.4 %
in Zanzibar (p value <0.0001). 94.5 % of all respondents were willing to
vaccinate their children against malaria, with a slight difference between
mainland Tanzania (94.3 %) and Zanzibar (96.8 %) (p value = 0.0167).
CONCLUSIONS: Although mothers had low awareness and high willingness to use
malaria vaccine, still availability of malaria vaccine RTS,S will compliment
other existing malaria interventions and it will be implemented through the
Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals (IVB) programme (formerly EPI). The
information generated from this study can aid policy makers in planning and
setting priorities for introducing and implementing the malaria vaccine.

BACKGROUND: Iron deficiency (ID) and malaria co-exist in tropical regions and
both contribute to high rates of anaemia in young children. It is unclear whether
iron fortification combined with intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) of
malaria would be an efficacious strategy for reducing anaemia in young children.
METHODS: A 9-month cluster-randomised, single-blinded, placebo-controlled
intervention trial was carried out in children aged 12-36 months in south-central
Côte d'Ivoire, an area of intense and perennial malaria transmission. The study
groups were: group 1: normal diet and IPT-placebo (n = 125); group 2: consumption
of porridge, an iron-fortified complementary food (CF) with optimised composition
providing 2 mg iron as NaFeEDTA and 3.8 mg iron as ferrous fumarate 6 days per
week (CF-FeFum) and IPT-placebo (n = 126); group 3: IPT of malaria at 3-month
intervals, using sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine and no dietary
intervention (n = 127); group 4: both CF-FeFum and IPT (n = 124); and group 5:
consumption of porridge, an iron-fortified CF with the composition currently on
the Ivorian market providing 2 mg iron as NaFeEDTA and 3.8 mg iron as ferric
pyrophosphate 6 days per week (CF-FePP) and IPT-placebo (n = 127). The primary
outcome was haemoglobin (Hb) concentration. Linear and logistic regression
mixed-effect models were used for the comparison of the five study groups, and a 
2 × 2 factorial analysis was used to assess treatment interactions of CF-FeFum
and IPT (study groups 1-4).
RESULTS: After 9 months, the Hb concentration increased in all groups to a
similar extent with no statistically significant difference between groups. In
the 2 × 2 factorial analysis after 9 months, no treatment interaction was found
on Hb (P = 0.89). The adjusted differences in Hb were 0.24 g/dl (95 % CI -0.10 to
0.59; P = 0.16) in children receiving IPT and -0.08 g/dl (95 % CI -0.42 to 0.26; 
P = 0.65) in children receiving CF-FeFum. At baseline, anaemia (Hb <11.0 g/dl)
was 82.1 %. After 9 months, IPT decreased the odds of anaemia (odds ratio [OR],
0.46 [95 % CI 0.23-0.91]; P = 0.023), whereas iron-fortified CF did not (OR, 0.85
[95 % CI 0.43-1.68]; P = 0.68), although ID (plasma ferritin <30 μg/l) was
decreased markedly in children receiving iron fortified CF (OR, 0.19 [95 % CI
0.09-0.40]; P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: IPT alone only modestly decreased anaemia, but neither IPT nor iron 
fortified CF significantly improved Hb concentration after 9 months.
Additionally, IPT did not augment the effect of the iron fortified CF. CF
fortified with highly bioavailable iron improved iron status but not Hb
concentration, despite three-monthly IPT of malaria. Thus, further research is
necessary to develop effective combination strategies to prevent and treat
anaemia in malaria endemic regions.

BACKGROUND: Defining the number and location of sprayable structures (houses) is 
foundational to plan and monitor indoor residual spray (IRS) implementation, a
primary intervention used to control the transmission of malaria. Only by mapping
the location and type of all sprayable structures can IRS operations be planned, 
estimates of spray coverage determined, and targeted delivery of IRS to specific 
locations be achieved. Previously, field-based enumeration has been used to guide
IRS campaigns, however, this approach is costly, time-consuming and difficult to 
scale. As a result, field-based enumeration typically fails to map all structures
in a given area, making estimations less reliable and reducing the enumerated
coverage.
METHODS: Using open source satellite imagery and Geographic Information System
software, satellite enumeration was conducted to guide IRS operations in 15
districts (91,302 km(2)) in northern Zambia during the 2014 spray season. Cost of
satellite enumeration was compared to standard enumeration. Enumerated households
were sampled to estimate sprayable surface area and wall type from the satellite 
enumeration using linear and logistic regression, respectively.
RESULTS: In comparison to the traditional field-based enumeration procedure,
satellite-based enumeration was 22 times faster, and 10 times less costly. An
estimated 98 % of the satellite enumerated buildings correctly classified roof
type. Predicted surface area of each household correlated at a value of 0.91 with
measured surface area of each household.
CONCLUSION: For IRS campaigns, high quality and high coverage enumeration data
aid in planning, through informed insecticide procurement. Through the
identification of geographical areas and populations to target, enumeration data 
guide operations and assist monitoring and evaluation of IRS through the unbiased
estimation of coverage achieved. Satellite enumeration represents a quick, cheap 
and accurate system to provide these data, and has potential applications beyond 
IRS for delivery of other targeted or non-targeted interventions (e.g. net
distributions, mass drug administration, immunization campaigns, or even sampling
frames for field studies).

BACKGROUND: With low and markedly seasonal malaria transmission, increasingly
sensitive tools for better stratifying the risk of infection and targeting
control interventions are needed. A cross-sectional survey to characterize the
current malaria transmission patterns, identify hotspots, and detect recent
changes using parasitological and serological measures was conducted in three
sites of the Peruvian Amazon.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: After full census of the study population, 651 participants
were interviewed, clinically examined and had a blood sample taken for the
detection of malaria parasites (microscopy and PCR) and antibodies against P.
vivax (PvMSP119, PvAMA1) and P. falciparum (PfGLURP, PfAMA1) antigens by ELISA.
Risk factors for malaria infection (positive PCR) and malaria exposure
(seropositivity) were assessed by multivariate survey logistic regression models.
Age-specific seroprevalence was analyzed using a reversible catalytic conversion 
model based on maximum likelihood for generating seroconversion rates (SCR, λ).
SaTScan was used to detect spatial clusters of serology-positive individuals
within each site.
RESULTS: The overall parasite prevalence by PCR was low, i.e. 3.9% for P. vivax
and 6.7% for P. falciparum, while the seroprevalence was substantially higher,
33.6% for P. vivax and 22.0% for P. falciparum, with major differences between
study sites. Age and location (site) were significantly associated with P. vivax 
exposure; while location, age and outdoor occupation were associated with P.
falciparum exposure. P. falciparum seroprevalence curves showed a stable
transmission throughout time, while for P. vivax transmission was better
described by a model with two SCRs. The spatial analysis identified well-defined 
clusters of P. falciparum seropositive individuals in two sites, while it
detected only a very small cluster of P. vivax exposure.
CONCLUSION: The use of a single parasitological and serological malaria survey
has proven to be an efficient and accurate method to characterize the species
specific heterogeneity in malaria transmission at micro-geographical level as
well as to identify recent changes in transmission.

INTRODUCTION: Severe falciparum malaria is commonly complicated by metabolic
acidosis. Together with lactic acid (LA), other previously unmeasured acids have 
been implicated in the pathogenesis of falciparum malaria.
METHODS: In this prospective study, we characterised organic acids in adults with
severe falciparum malaria in India and Bangladesh. Liquid chromatography-mass
spectrometry was used to measure organic acids in plasma and urine. Patients were
followed until recovery or death.
RESULTS: Patients with severe malaria (n=138), uncomplicated malaria (n=102),
sepsis (n=32) and febrile encephalopathy (n=35) were included. Strong ion gap
(mean ± SD) was elevated in severe malaria (8.2 mEq/L ± 4.5) and severe sepsis
(8.6 mEq/L ± 7.7) compared with uncomplicated malaria (6.0 mEq/L ± 5.1) and
encephalopathy (6.6 mEq/L ± 4.7). Compared with uncomplicated malaria, severe
malaria was characterised by elevated plasma LA, hydroxyphenyllactic acid (HPLA),
α-hydroxybutyric acid and β-hydroxybutyric acid (all P<0.05). In urine,
concentrations of methylmalonic, ethylmalonic and α-ketoglutaric acids were also 
elevated. Multivariate logistic regression showed that plasma HPLA was a strong
independent predictor of death (odds ratio [OR] 3.5, 95 % confidence interval
[CI] 1.6-7.5, P=0.001), comparable to LA (OR 3.5, 95 % CI 1.5-7.8, P=0.003)
(combined area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.81).
CONCLUSIONS: Newly identified acids, in addition to LA, are elevated in patients 
with severe malaria and are highly predictive of fatal outcome. Further
characterisation of their sources and metabolic pathways is now needed.

BACKGROUND: Artemisinin-resistant Plasmodium falciparum has emerged in the
Greater Mekong sub-region and poses a major global public health threat. Slow
parasite clearance is a key clinical manifestation of reduced susceptibility to
artemisinin. This study was designed to establish the baseline values for
clearance in patients from Sub-Saharan African countries with uncomplicated
malaria treated with artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs).
METHODS: A literature review in PubMed was conducted in March 2013 to identify
all prospective clinical trials (uncontrolled trials, controlled trials and
randomized controlled trials), including ACTs conducted in Sub-Saharan Africa,
between 1960 and 2012. Individual patient data from these studies were shared
with the WorldWide Antimalarial Resistance Network (WWARN) and pooled using an a 
priori statistical analytical plan. Factors affecting early parasitological
response were investigated using logistic regression with study sites fitted as a
random effect. The risk of bias in included studies was evaluated based on study 
design, methodology and missing data.
RESULTS: In total, 29,493 patients from 84 clinical trials were included in the
analysis, treated with artemether-lumefantrine (n = 13,664),
artesunate-amodiaquine (n = 11,337) and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (n =
4,492). The overall parasite clearance rate was rapid. The parasite positivity
rate (PPR) decreased from 59.7 % (95 % CI: 54.5-64.9) on day 1 to 6.7 % (95 % CI:
4.8-8.7) on day 2 and 0.9 % (95 % CI: 0.5-1.2) on day 3. The 95th percentile of
observed day 3 PPR was 5.3 %. Independent risk factors predictive of day 3
positivity were: high baseline parasitaemia (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.16 (95
% CI: 1.08-1.25); per 2-fold increase in parasite density, P <0.001); fever
(>37.5 °C) (AOR = 1.50 (95 % CI: 1.06-2.13), P = 0.022); severe anaemia (AOR =
2.04 (95 % CI: 1.21-3.44), P = 0.008); areas of low/moderate transmission setting
(AOR = 2.71 (95 % CI: 1.38-5.36), P = 0.004); and treatment with the loose
formulation of artesunate-amodiaquine (AOR = 2.27 (95 % CI: 1.14-4.51), P =
0.020, compared to dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine).
CONCLUSIONS: The three ACTs assessed in this analysis continue to achieve rapid
early parasitological clearance across the sites assessed in Sub-Saharan Africa. 
A threshold of 5 % day 3 parasite positivity from a minimum sample size of 50
patients provides a more sensitive benchmark in Sub-Saharan Africa compared to
the current recommended threshold of 10 % to trigger further investigation of
artemisinin susceptibility.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the frequency, clinical features, and factors associated
with M. ozzardi infection in volunteers of a malaria screening campaign in the
district of Alto Nanay in the Amazon jungle of Peru.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A descriptive, analytical and cross-sectional study was
performed. The participants were interviewed and examined by a physician and the 
data were recorded in a medical record. The diagnosis of M. ozzardi infection was
performed using the method of thick blood smear and film.
RESULTS: The frequency of mansonelosis in this population was 47.8% (95% CI: 39.1
to 56.6). Through bivariate analysis we found that the report of decreased visual
acuity or blurred vision and presence of subcutaneous tumors were the signs and
symptoms statistically associated with the infection of microfilariae (p<0.05).
Logistic regression found statistical association for residency in localities of 
the Pintuyacu or Alto Nanay rivers, employment in places far from the town
center, the presence of subcutaneous tumors and skin thickening (p<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: There was a high number of mansonelosis by M. ozzardi in the
district of Alto Nanay which was significantly related to working outside the
town center, residing in the area of the Pintuyacu River, and skin lesions.

Members of the Anopheles gambiae sensu lato (Giles) complex define a group of
seven morphologically indistinguishable species, including the principal malaria 
vectors in Sub-Saharan Africa. Members of this complex differ in behavior and
ability to transmit malaria; hence, precise identification of member species is
critical to monitoring and evaluating malaria threat levels. We collected
mosquitoes from five counties in Liberia every other month from May 2011 until
May 2012, using various trapping techniques. A. gambiae complex members were
identified using molecular techniques based on differences in the ribosomal DNA
(rDNA) region between species and the molecular forms (S and M) of A. gambiae
sensu stricto (s.s) specimens. In total, 1,696 A. gambiae mosquitoes were
collected and identified. DNA was extracted from legs of each specimen with
species identification determined by multiplex polymerase chain reaction using
specific primers. The molecular forms (M or S) of A. gambiae s.s were determined 
by restriction fragment length polymorphism. Bivariate and multivariate logistic 
regression models identified environmental variables associated with genomic
differentiation. Our results indicate widespread occurrence of A. gambiae s.s.,
the principal malaria vector in the complex, although two Anopheles melas
Theobald/A. merus Donitz mosquitoes were detected. We found 72.6, 25.5, and 1.9% 
of A. gambiae s.s specimens were S, M, and hybrid forms, respectively.
Statistical analysis indicates that the S form was more likely to be found in
rural areas during rainy seasons and indoor catchments. This information will
enhance vector control efforts in Liberia.

BACKGROUND: Pneumonia is the leading cause of infectious death amongst children
globally, with the highest burden in Africa. Early identification of children at 
risk of treatment failure in the community and prompt referral could lower
mortality. A number of clinical markers have been independently associated with
oral antibiotic failure in childhood pneumonia. This study aimed to develop a
prognostic model for fast-breathing pneumonia treatment failure in sub-Saharan
Africa.
METHOD: We prospectively followed a cohort of children (2-59 months), diagnosed
by community health workers with fast-breathing pneumonia using World Health
Organisation (WHO) integrated community case management guidelines. Cases were
followed at days 5 and 14 by study data collectors, who assessed a range of
pre-determined clinical features for treatment outcome. We built the prognostic
model using eight pre-defined parameters, using multivariable logistic
regression, validated through bootstrapping.
RESULTS: We assessed 1,542 cases of which 769 were included (32% ineligible; 19% 
defaulted). The treatment failure rate was 15% at day 5 and relapse was 4% at day
14. Concurrent malaria diagnosis (OR: 1.62; 95% CI: 1.06, 2.47) and moderate
malnutrition (OR: 1.88; 95% CI: 1.09, 3.26) were associated with treatment
failure. The model demonstrated poor calibration and discrimination (c-statistic:
0.56).
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that it may be difficult to create a pragmatic
community-level prognostic child pneumonia tool based solely on clinical markers 
and pulse oximetry in an HIV and malaria endemic setting. Further work is needed 
to identify more accurate and reliable referral algorithms that remain feasible
for use by community health workers.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate antibiotic use among patients presenting to primary
healthcare facilities with febrile illness in Zambia.
METHODS: We analysed data from a 2011 nationwide cross-sectional health facility 
survey of routine malaria case management in Zambia. Patient consultation
observation and medical record charts were used to calculate the proportion of
febrile patients who were prescribed antibiotics, stratified by symptoms, health 
workers' diagnosis and malaria test results. Logistic regression was used to
identify factors affecting antibiotic prescribing behaviour.
RESULTS: Of 872 patients presenting with fever, 651 (74.6%) were tested for
malaria. Among those tested, 608 (93.4%) had analysable results; 230 (37.8%) had 
positive results. Antibiotics were prescribed to 69/230 (30.0%), 247/378 (65.3%) 
and 132/221 (59.7%) of those who tested positive, negative and those 'not
tested', respectively. Furthermore, antibiotics were prescribed to 36/59 (61.0%) 
and 242/322 (75.1%) of those diagnosed with diarrhoea and upper respiratory tract
infection (URTI), respectively. Among patients prescribed any antibiotic,
concurrent antimalarial prescribing occurred in 66/69 (95.6%), 32/247 (12.9%) and
19/132 (14.4%) for those with positive results, negative results and 'not
tested', respectively. Respiratory symptoms, diagnosis of URTI, malaria or skin
disease and level of health care in the health delivery system were associated
with antibiotic prescribing.
CONCLUSIONS: Testing positive for malaria or receiving a malaria diagnosis was
associated with reduced antibiotic prescribing, while testing negative, not being
tested or a diagnosis of URTI resulted in higher rates of antibiotic prescribing.
There is a need for improving diagnostic capacity for non-malaria causes of
febrile illness at healthcare delivery points and limiting antibiotic use to
patients with definite bacterial infections.

Studies that explored women's knowledge on mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of
HIV and its prevention (PMTCT) in the general population are currently lacking.
This paper examined factors associated with having adequate knowledge of MTCT of 
HIV and PMTCT among a nationally representative sample of women in Tanzania. We
conducted a cross-sectional analysis including 10,299 women from the 2011-2012
Tanzania HIV/AIDS and Malaria Indicator Survey. The outcome of interest was the
presence of adequate knowledge on MTCT and PMTCT of HIV. We used multivariable
logistic regression to identify factors associated with having adequate knowledge
on MTCT and PMTCT of HIV. Results revealed that the overall prevalence of having 
adequate knowledge on MTCT and PMTCT of HIV was low (46%). We found a
statistically significant difference in the proportions of having adequate
knowledge between HIV-negative and HIV-positive women (45% vs. 56%; p < .0001),
although knowledge of the transplacental route of transmission did not differ by 
HIV serostatus. Overall, having adequate knowledge on MTCT and PMTCT of HIV was
positively associated with experiencing at least one pregnancy, having some
education, having higher household wealth, residing in urban area, being exposed 
to HIV education, having tested for HIV, knowing a place to get HIV test, and
having comprehensive knowledge on HIV and AIDS. Among HIV-seropositive women,
experiencing at least one pregnancy and having comprehensive knowledge on HIV and
AIDS were strongly associated with having adequate knowledge on MTCT and PMTCT of
HIV (Adjusted odds ratio: aOR 2.78, 95% CI 1.21, 6.37 and aOR 1.71, 95% CI 1.15, 
2.73, respectively). Further efforts are needed to enhance HIV/AIDS education
among women of childbearing age and strengthen PMTCT services in Tanzania.

INTRODUCTION: Patients receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) require routine
monitoring to track response to treatment and assess for treatment failure. This 
study aims to identify gaps in monitoring practices in Kenya and Uganda.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic retrospective chart review of adults who
initiated ART between 2007 and 2012. We assessed the availability of baseline
measurements (CD4 count, weight, and WHO stage) and ongoing CD4 and weight
monitoring according to national guidelines in place at the time. Mixed-effects
logistic regression models were used to analyze facility and patient factors
associated with meeting monitoring guidelines.
RESULTS: From 2007 to 2012, at least 88% of patients per year in Uganda had a
recorded weight at initiation, while in Kenya there was a notable increase from
69% to 90%. Patients with a documented baseline CD4 count increased from 69% to
about 80% in both countries. In 2012, 83% and 86% of established patients
received the recommended quarterly weight monitoring in Kenya and Uganda,
respectively, while semiannual CD4 monitoring was less common (49% in Kenya and
38% in Uganda). Initiating at a more advanced WHO stage was associated with a
lower odds of baseline CD4 testing. On-site CD4 analysis capacity was associated 
with increased odds of CD4 testing at baseline and in the future.
DISCUSSION: Substantial gaps were noted in ongoing CD4 monitoring of patients on 
ART. Although guidelines have since changed, limited laboratory capacity is
likely to remain a significant issue in monitoring patients on ART, with
important implications for ensuring quality care.

BACKGROUND: Intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) and
insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) can reduce the morbidity and mortality
associated with malaria in pregnancy. Although the coverage for both IPTp and ITN
use have been described in Malawi, the analysis of factors associated with IPTp
receipt and ITN use is lacking. This analysis was conducted to assess IPTp and
ITN use and predictors of use by women of child-bearing age (WOCBA).
METHODS: A two-stage cluster-sample cross-sectional survey was conducted April
16-30, 2009 in eight districts across Malawi. Information on receipt of two or
more doses of IPTp, ITN ownership, and ITN use the night before the survey was
collected. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess predictors of IPTp
and ITN use.
RESULTS: Data were collected from 7407 households containing 6985 WOCBA and 3213 
recently pregnant women (women who reported a completed pregnancy in the 2 years 
before the survey). Most recently pregnant women (96 %) had at least one
antenatal care (ANC) clinic visit; 91 % reported receiving at least one dose of
IPTp, and 72 % reported receiving two or more doses of IPTp. Women in Phalombe,
Rumphi, and Lilongwe were more likely to receive two doses of IPTp than those in 
Blantyre [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.5 (95 % CI 1.5-4.5), 2.5 (95 % CI 1.5-4.3),
and 2.0 (95 % CI 1.2-3.1), respectively]. Educated women were more likely to have
received IPTp compared to women with no education [aOR 1.6 (95 % CI 1.0-2.6) for 
those who completed primary school, aOR1.9 (95 % CI 1.1-3.3) for some secondary
school, and aOR 4.1 (95 % CI 1.9-8.7) for completed secondary school or above],
and women in the poorest socioeconomic status quintile were less likely to
receive IPTp than those in the least poor quintile [aOR 0.68 (95 % CI
0.48-0.97)]. In all, 53 % of WOCBA used an ITN the previous night. Women in
Nkhotkhota and Phalombe were less likely to have slept under an ITN the previous 
night compared to those in Blantyre [aOR 0.52 (95 % CI 0.39-0.69) and aOR 0.67
(95 % CI 0.47-0.95), respectively]. In addition, age [aOR 0.61 (95 % CI
0.45-0.83) for women 15-19 years old], and either being currently pregnant [aOR
1.5 (95 % CI 1.2-2.0)] or having been pregnant in the previous 2 years [aOR 2.4, 
(95 % CI 2.1-2.8)] were associated with ITN use.
CONCLUSION: In Malawi in 2009, IPTp and ITN use in WOCBA fell short of national
and international goals. Adoption of new guidelines encouraging administration of
IPTp at every scheduled ANC visit might increase IPTp use. Increasing health
promotion activities to encourage earlier attendance at ANC clinics and create
demand for IPTp and ITNs might improve overall IPTp and ITN use.

BACKGROUND: Globally, an estimated 6.3 million children under-five years of age
died in the year 2013. To reduce the burden of morbidity and mortality of
infants, Ethiopia adopted the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendation of
exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) for the first six months of life. The objective of 
this study was to assess factors associated with EBF practices among mothers who 
have an infant aged below 12 months in Debre Berhan District, Ethiopia.
METHODS: In this study we employed a cross sectional community based quantitative
survey method, and data were collected from January through April 2014.
Univariate statistical analysis was used to describe variables using frequencies 
and percentages. Multivariable logistic regression model was developed; the
factors associated with EBF practice were identified.
RESULT: We enrolled 634 mothers with their index infant aged under 12 months.
Four hundred thirty five (68.6 %; 95 % CI: 64.9 %, 72.2 %) mothers practiced EBF 
to six months. In this study 83.4 % of mothers were knowledgeable with the
recommended duration of EBF. About 97.5 % of mothers had a positive attitude
towards EBF practice. Mothers from rural places were 4.54 times likely to EBF
than mothers residing in urban areas Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR 4.54; 95 % CI:
2.64, 7.81, p = 0.001). The odds of mothers aged 25 to 35 years to practice EBF
was up to 8.9 times more than mothers aged less than 25 years (AOR 8.99; 95 % CI:
4.56, 17.73, p = 0.001). The odds of mothers who didn't receive infant feeding
counselling was 0.42 times less likely to practice EBF than those who received
Counselling services (AOR 0.42; 95 % CI: 0.24, 0.73, p = 0.002). Employed mothers
were found to be 0.36 times less likely to practice EBF than housewives (AOR
0.36; 95 % CI: 0.18, 0.73, p = 0.005). Household income did not show a
statistically significant association with EBF.
CONCLUSIONS: The knowledge and attitude of mothers towards EBF was found to be
very high. In this study, two thirds of mothers practiced exclusive
breastfeeding. Improving access to information on recommended infant feeding
during routine maternal and child health services is recommended. It is important
to encourage EBF among the young, employed and urban mothers through proper
counselling and mother friendly work environment.

Tafenoquine (TQ), a new 8-aminoquinoline with activity against all stages of the 
Plasmodium vivax life cycle, is being developed for the radical cure of acute P. 
vivax malaria in combination with chloroquine. The efficacy and exposure data
from a pivotal phase 2b dose-ranging study were used to conduct exposure-response
analyses for TQ after administration to subjects with P. vivax malaria. TQ
exposure (i.e., area under the concentration-time curve [AUC]) and region
(Thailand compared to Peru and Brazil) were found to be statistically significant
predictors of clinical response based on multivariate logistic regression
analyses. After accounting for region/country, the odds of being relapse free at 
6 months increased by approximately 51% (95% confidence intervals [CI], 25%, 82%)
for each 25-U increase in AUC above the median value of 54.5 μg · h/ml. TQ
exposure was also a significant predictor of the time to relapse of the
infection. The final parametric, time-to-event model for the time to relapse,
included a Weibull distribution hazard function, AUC, and country as covariates. 
Based on the model, the risk of relapse decreased by 30% (95% CI, 17% to 42%) for
every 25-U increase in AUC. Monte Carlo simulations indicated that the 300-mg
dose of TQ would provide an AUC greater than the clinically relevant breakpoint
obtained in a classification and regression tree (CART) analysis (56.4 μg · h/ml)
in more than 90% of subjects and consequently result in a high probability of
being relapse free at 6 months. This model-based approach was critical in
selecting an appropriate phase 3 dose. (This study has been registered at
ClinicalTrials.gov under registration no. NCT01376167.).

BACKGROUND: Reactive case detection (RACD) for malaria is a strategy that may be 
used to complement passive surveillance, as passive surveillance fails to
identify infections that are asymptomatic or do not seek care. The spatial and
seasonal patterns of incident (index) cases reported at a single clinic in
Chongwe District were explored.
METHODS: A RACD strategy was implemented from June 2012 to June 2013 in a single 
catchment area in Chongwe District. Incident (index) cases recorded at the clinic
were followed up at their household, and all household contacts were tested for
malaria using rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). GPS coordinates were taken at each
index household. Spatial analyses were conducted to assess characteristics
related to clustering, cluster detection and spatial variation in risk of index
houses. Effects of season (rainy versus dry), distance to the clinic and distance
to the main road were considered as modifying factors. Lastly, logistic
regression was used to identify factors associated with the proportion of
household contacts testing RDT positive.
RESULTS: A total of 426 index households were enrolled, with 1,621 household
contacts (45% RDT positive). Two space-time clusters were identified in the rainy
season, with ten times and six times higher risk than expected. Significantly
increased spatial clustering of index households was found in the rainy season as
compared to the dry season (based on K-function methodology). However, no
seasonal difference in mapped spatial intensity of index households was
identified. Logistic regression analysis identified two main factors associated
with a higher proportion of RDT positive household contacts. There was a 41%
increased odds of RDT positive household contacts in households where the index
case was under 5 years of age [OR = 1.41, 95% confidence intervals (1.15, 1.73)].
For every 500-m increase in distance from the road, there was a 5% increased odds
of RDT positive household contacts [OR = 1.05 (1.02, 1.07)], controlling for
season.
DISCUSSION: Areas of increased report of malaria persist after controlling for
distance to the clinic and main road. Clinic-based interventions will miss
asymptomatic, non-care seeking infections located farther from the road. RACD may
identify additional infections missed at the clinic.

Mortality rates among hospitalized children in many government hospitals in
sub-Saharan Africa are high. Pediatric emergency services in these hospitals are 
often sub-optimal. Timely recognition of critically ill children on arrival is
key to improving service delivery. We present a simple risk score to predict
inpatient mortality among hospitalized children. Between April 2010 and June
2011, the Uganda Malaria Surveillance Project (UMSP), in collaboration with the
National Malaria Control Program (NMCP), set up an enhanced sentinel site malaria
surveillance program for children hospitalized at four public hospitals in
different districts: Tororo, Apac, Jinja and Mubende. Clinical data collected
through March 2013, representing 50249 admissions were used to develop a
mortality risk score (derivation data set). One year of data collected
subsequently from the same hospitals, representing 20406 admissions, were used to
prospectively validate the performance of the risk score (validation data set).
Using a backward selection approach, 13 out of 25 clinical parameters
recognizable on initial presentation, were selected for inclusion in a final
logistic regression prediction model. The presence of individual parameters was
awarded a score of either 1 or 2 based on regression coefficients. For each
individual patient, a composite risk score was generated. The risk score was
further categorized into three categories; low, medium, and high. Patient
characteristics were comparable in both data sets. Measures of performance for
the risk score included the receiver operating characteristics curves and the
area under the curve (AUC), both demonstrating good and comparable ability to
predict deathusing both the derivation (AUC =0.76) and validation dataset (AUC
=0.74). Using the derivation and validation datasets, the mortality rates in each
risk category were as follows: low risk (0.8% vs. 0.7%), moderate risk (3.5% vs. 
3.2%), and high risk (16.5% vs. 12.6%), respectively. Our analysis resulted in
development of a risk score that ably predicted mortality risk among hospitalized
children. While validation studies are needed, this approach could be used to
improve existing triage systems.

The detection of severe malaria in resource-constrained settings is often
difficult because of requirements for laboratory infrastructure and/or clinical
expertise. The aim of this study, therefore, was to explore the utility of a
multiple antigen (HRP-2/pLDH) rapid diagnostic test (RDT) as a low-cost,
surrogate marker of patients at high risk for complications of severe malaria. We
reviewed programmatic data at a peripheral health center in Western Uganda.
Available demographic and clinical data on all individuals presenting to the
center who underwent an RDT for suspected malaria infection were reviewed. We fit
logistic regression models to identify correlates of two outcomes of interest: 1)
severe malaria-related anemia, defined here as hemoglobin ≤7g/dL and 2) receipt
of parenteral quinine. 1509 patients underwent malaria testing with an SD FK60
RDT during the observation period. A total of 637 (42%) RDTs were positive for at
least one species of malaria, of which 326 (51%) exhibited a single HRP-2 band
and 307 (48%) exhibited both HRP-2 and pLDH bands, while 4 exhibited only a
single pLDH band. There was a trend towards more severe anemia in patients with a
HRP-2/pLDH positive RDT compared to a HRP-2 only RDT (β = -0.99 g/dl, 95% CI
-1.99 to 0.02, P = 0.055). A HRP-2/pLDH positive RDT was associated with an
increased risk of severe malaria-related anemia compared to a negative RDT
(adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 18.8, 95% CI 4.32 to 82.0, P < 0.001) and to a HRP-2
only RDT (AOR 2.46, 95% CI 0.75 to 8.04, P = 0.14). There was no significant
association between RDT result and the administration of parenteral quinine.
These results offer preliminary evidence that specific patterns of antigen
positivity on RDTs could be utilized to identify patients at an increased risk
for complications of severe malaria.

BACKGROUND: Long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) have been widely distributed
in Sri Lanka for malaria control. Their effectiveness depends on proper
utilisation and maintenance at the household level.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed to examine the patterns and
predictive factors of LLIN maintenance and use in Anuradhapura district. Data was
collected and analysed from 530 LLIN-owning households, selected by a multi-stage
cluster sampling technique. Multivariable logistic regression identified factors 
associated with proper maintenance at the household level. Hierarchical linear
modelling identified factors associated with LLIN use the previous night.
RESULTS: Almost 75% (377/504) of households had used all their LLINs the previous
night, while 82.9% (418/504) had used at least one. Only 3.2% (15/474) were
maintaining the LLIN in such a way as to maximise its insecticidal efficacy. Six 
variables were significantly associated (p<0.05) with use the previous night:
more residents, fewer plain nets, reporting practical benefits of LLINs, conical 
shape, newer nets and lack of side effects. Two variables were significantly
associated with proper maintenance: increasing level of education and taking
safety precautions while washing.
CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest LLIN practices could improve in settings of low
malaria transmission if distribution programmes took into account recipient
preferences, promoted LLIN use over plain nets, and emphasised the techniques and
significance of proper net maintenance.

BACKGROUND: A procoagulant state is implicated in cerebral malaria (CM)
pathogenesis, but whether disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is present
or associated with a fatal outcome is unclear.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the frequency of overt DIC, according to ISTH criteria, 
in children with fatal and non-fatal CM.
METHODS/PATIENTS: Malawian children were recruited into a prospective cohort
study in the following diagnostic groups: retinopathy-positive CM (n = 140),
retinopathy-negative CM (n = 36), non-malarial coma (n = 14), uncomplicated
malaria (UM), (n = 91), mild non-malarial febrile illness (n = 85), and healthy
controls (n = 36). Assays in the ISTH DIC criteria were performed, and three
fibrin-related markers, i.e. protein C, antithrombin, and soluble thrombomodulin,
were measured.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Data enabling assignment of the presence or absence of
'overt DIC' were available for 98 of 140 children with retinopathy-positive CM.
Overt DIC was present in 19 (19%), and was associated with a fatal outcome (odds 
ratio [OR] 3.068; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.085-8.609; P = 0.035]. The
levels of the three fibrin-related markers and soluble thrombomodulin were higher
in CM patients than in UM patients (all P < 0.001). The mean fibrin degradation
product level was higher in fatal CM patients (71.3 μg mL(-1) [95% CI 49.0-93.6])
than in non-fatal CM patients (48.0 μg mL(-1) [95% CI 37.7-58.2]; P = 0.032),
but, in multivariate logistic regression, thrombomodulin was the only
coagulation-related marker that was independently associated with a fatal outcome
(OR 1.084 for each ng mL(-1) increase [95% CI 1.017-1.156]; P = 0.014). Despite
these laboratory derangements, no child in the study had clinically evident
bleeding or thrombosis. An overt DIC score and high thrombomodulin levels are
associated with a fatal outcome in CM, but infrequently indicate a consumptive
coagulopathy.

INTRODUCTION: Malaria is still a public health problem in Sub-Saharan Africa.
Malaria causes mortality mostly in children under-five years. Early detection and
prompt treatment using recommended antimalarials is key to malaria control.
However, in Tanzania, contrary to the national goals, a large proportion of
children with fever taken to health facilities are not tested for malaria and
those tested positive are not promptly treated using recommended antimalarials.
The aim of this study was to determine factors associated with malaria testing
and prompt use of recommended antimalarials among under-five children with fever 
in Tanzania.
METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of Tanzania HIV and Malaria Indicator
Survey (THMIS) data 2011-12 obtained from a national cross sectional survey. The 
analysis involved children aged 6-59 months whose mothers reported they had fever
two weeks preceding the survey. Factors associated with testing and uses of
recommended antimalarials were obtained using logistic regression.
RESULTS: Of the 1675 under-five children with fever, 951 (56.8%) were taken to
the health facilities. Of the 951 children, only 394 (41.48%) febrile children
were tested for malaria. Of those tested, 291 (78.91%) were diagnosed with
malaria. Of those diagnosed with malaria, only 124 (42.68%) children used
recommended antimalarials within 1st 24 hours of diagnosis. In multivariate
analysis, children taken to health centers (OR 1.79; 95%CI: 1.07-3.00) and to the
hospitals (OR 3.4; 95%CI: 1.75-6.77) had higher odds of being tested compared to 
those taken to dispensary and other lower level health facilities. Children were 
more likely to use recommended antimalarial promptly if they had a caretaker with
secondary or higher education (OR: 4.07; 95%CI: 0.61-2.68) or living in the rural
area (OR: 3.21; 95%CI: 1.09-9.44) compared to those with an uneducated caretaker 
or from an urban area.
CONCLUSION: Training on malaria testing and treatment guidelines should be
provided, and preventing stock outs of malaria testing kits and medications at
dispensary level should be made available as it is the first point of health care
for most Tanzanians. Reasons on why urban people are less likely to use
recommended antimalarials need to be investigated and addressed for proper
malaria management.

BACKGROUND: The three members of the ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigen
(RESA) proteins family share high sequence homologies, which impair the detection
and assignment to one or another protein of some pathogenic processes inherent to
Plasmodium falciparum malaria. The present study was intended to determine if the
antibody and inflammatory responses of children living in a malaria-endemic area 
varied depending on the RESA-1, RESA-2 or RESA-3 proteins and the severity of the
disease, two groups of severe and uncomplicated malaria cases being considered.
METHODS: Two synthetic peptides representing predicted B cell epitopes were
designed per RESA protein, all located outside of the 3' and 5' repetition
blocks, in order to allow an antibody detection specific of each member of the
family. Recombinant rRESA-1B and rRESA-3B proteins were also engineered. Two
groups of Beninese children admitted to hospital in 2009 for either uncomplicated
or severe malaria were compared for their plasma levels of IgG specifically
recognizing each recombinant RESA protein or synthetic peptide, and for their
plasma inflammatory cytokine levels (IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-10), taking into account
host and parasite genetic factors.
RESULTS: The absence of IgG cross-reactivity between rRESA proteins and their
protein carrier as well as between each RESA peptide and a non-epitopic RESA
control peptide validated the use of the engineered recombinant proteins and
peptides for the measurement of plasma IgG. Taking into account age, fever
duration and parasitaemia, a multiple logistic regression performed on children
clustered according to their antibody responses' profiles concluded to an
increased risk of severe malaria for P2 (representative of RESA-1) responders (P 
= 0.007). Increased IL-10 plasma levels were found in children harbouring
multiclonal P. falciparum infections on the basis of the T1526G resa2 gene
polymorphism (P = 0.004).
CONCLUSIONS: This study provided novel tools to dissect the seroreactivity
against the three members of the RESA protein family and to describe its relation
to protection against malaria. It suggested the measurement of plasma antibodies 
raised against specific peptides to serve as predictive immunologic markers for
disease severity. Lastly, it reinforced previous observations linking the T1526G 
resa2 gene mutation to severe malaria.

Mozambique's updated guideline for management of HIV-associated anemia prompts
clinicians to consider opportunistic conditions, adverse drug reactions, and
untreated immunosuppression in addition to iron deficiency, intestinal
helminthes, and malaria. We prospectively evaluated this guideline in rural
Zambézia Province. Likely cause(s) of anemia were determined through prespecified
history, physical examination, and laboratory testing. Diagnoses were "etiologic"
if laboratory confirmed (sputum microscopy, blood culture, Plasmodium falciparum 
malaria rapid test) or "syndromic" if not. To assess hemoglobin response, we used
serial point-of-care measurements. We studied 324 ambulatory, anemic (hemoglobin 
<10 g/dl) HIV-infected adults. Study clinicians treated nearly all [315 (97.2%)] 
for suspected iron deficiency and/or helminthes; 56 (17.3%) had
laboratory-confirmed malaria. Other assigned diagnoses included tuberculosis [30 
(9.3%)], adverse drug reactions [26 (8.0%)], and bacteremia [13 (4.1%)].
Etiologic diagnosis was achieved in 79 (24.4%). Of 169 (52.2%) subjects who
improved (hemoglobin increase of ≥1 g/dl without indications for
hospitalization), only 65 (38.5%) received conventional management (iron
supplementation, deworming, and/or antimalarials) alone. Thirty (9.3%) died
and/or were hospitalized, and 125 (38.6%) were lost to follow-up. Multivariable
linear and logistic regression models described better hemoglobin responses
and/or outcomes in subjects with higher CD4(+) T-lymphocyte counts,
pre-enrollment antiretroviral therapy and/or co-trimoxazole prophylaxis,
discontinuation of zidovudine for suspected adverse reaction, and smear-positive 
tuberculosis. Adverse outcomes were associated with fever, low body mass index,
bacteremia, esophageal candidiasis, and low or missing CD4(+) T cell counts. In
this severely resource-limited setting, successful anemia management often
required interventions other than conventional presumptive treatment, thus
supporting Mozambique's guideline revision.

BACKGROUND: In Senegal, a significant decrease of malaria transmission intensity 
has been noted the last years. Parasitaemia has become lower and, therefore, more
difficult to detect by microscopy. In the context of submicroscopic parasitaemia,
it has become relevant to rely on relevant malaria surveillance tools to better
document malaria epidemiology in such settings. Serological markers have been
proposed as an essential tool for malaria surveillance. This study aimed to
evaluate the sero-epidemiological situation of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in
two sentinel sites in Senegal.
METHODS: Cross-sectional surveys were carried out in Velingara (south Senegal)
and Keur Soce (central Senegal) between September and October 2010. Children
under 10 years old, living in these areas, were enrolled using two-level, random 
sampling methods. P. falciparum infection was diagnosed using microscopy. P.
falciparum antibodies against circumsporozoite protein (CSP), apical membrane
protein (AMA1) and merozoite surface protein 1_42 (MSP1_42) were measured by
ELISA method. A stepwise logistic regression analysis was done to assess factors 
associated with P. falciparum antibodies carriage.
RESULTS: A total of 1,865 children under 10 years old were enrolled. The overall 
falciparum malaria prevalence was 4.99% with high prevalence in Velingara of
10.03% compared to Keur Soce of 0.3%. Symptomatic malaria cases (fever associated
with parasitaemia) represented 17.37%. Seroprevalence of anti-AMA1, anti-MSP1_42 
and anti-CSP antibody was 38.12, 41.55 and 40.38%, respectively. The
seroprevalence was more important in Velingara and increased with age, active
malaria infection and area of residence.
CONCLUSION: The use of serological markers can contribute to improved malaria
surveillance in areas with declining malaria transmission. This study provided
useful baseline information about the sero-epidemiological situation of malaria
in Senegal and can contribute to the identification of malaria hot spots in order
to concentrate intervention efforts.

BACKGROUND: Insecticide-treated nets are the cornerstone of global malaria
control and have been shown to reduce malaria morbidity by 50-60%. However, some 
areas are experiencing a resurgence in malaria following successful control. We
describe an efficacy decay framework to understand why high malaria burden
persists even under high ITN coverage in a community in western Kenya.
METHODS: We enrolled 442 children hospitalized with malaria and paired them with 
age, time, village and gender-matched controls. We completed comprehensive
household and neighborhood assessments including entomological surveillance. The 
indicators are grouped into five domains in an efficacy decay framework: ITN
ownership, compliance, physical integrity, vector susceptibility and facilitating
factors. After variable selection, case-control data were analyzed using
conditional logistic regression models and mosquito data were analyzed using
negative binomial regression. Predictive margins were calculated from logistic
regression models.
RESULTS: Measures of ITN coverage and physical integrity were not correlated with
hospitalized malaria in our study. However, consistent ITN use (Adjusted Odds
Ratio (AOR) = 0.23, 95%CI: 0.12-0.43), presence of nearby larval sites (AOR =
1.137, 95%CI: 1.02-1.27), and specific types of crops (AOR (grains) = 0.446,
95%CI: 0.24-0.82) were significantly correlated with malaria amongst children who
owned an ITN. The odds of hospitalization for febrile malaria nearly tripled when
one other household member had symptomatic malaria infection (AOR-2.76,
95%CI:1.83-4.18). Overall, perfect household adherence could reduce the
probability of hospitalization for malaria to less than 30% (95%CI:0.12-0.46) and
adjusting environmental factors such as elimination of larval sites and growing
grains nearby could reduce the probability of hospitalization for malaria to less
than 20% (95%CI:0.04-0.31).
CONCLUSION: Availability of ITNs is not the bottleneck for malaria prevention in 
this community. Behavior change interventions to improve compliance and
environmental management of mosquito breeding habitats may greatly enhance ITN
efficacy. A better understanding of the relationship between agriculture and
mosquito survival and feeding success is needed.

Identification and glycobiological characterization of circulating immune
complexes in patients with visceral leishmaniasis and post kala azar dermal
leishmaniasis.

Datta S, Modak D, Sarkar S, Saha B, Mukhopadhyay S.

Here, we investigated the quantitative and qualitative differences in antibody
classes and subclasses in serum immune complexes (ICs) of Visceral Leishmaniasis 
(VL), Post Kala-azar Dermal Leishmaniasis (PKDL) and different cross reactive
diseases like Malaria, Leprosy, Vitiligo as compared to control subjects. IC
levels were measured through a newly developed PEG ELISA, using L. donovani
promastigote membrane antigen coated plate. Antibody classes and subclasses were 
identified using polyspecific sera and monoclonal antibodies, respectively. ICs
were purified using polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation. Conditional logistic
regression showed an association between IgG1-containing ICs and increased risk
of PKDL (OR = 75, P < 0.05) and an association of IgG-containing ICs with VL (OR 
= 621, P = 0.001). PEG ELISA demonstrated almost 13-15 fold higher IgG containing
ICs titers in VL as compared to control (P < 0.001). The assay further
established a significant (P < 0.05) difference in the IgG containing ICs titers 
between VL and PKDL. The isolated ICs were further analyzed by subjecting them to
one-dimensional PAGE and subsequently stained with combination of periodic acid
schiff (PAS) with silver. A differential banding pattern between VL and PKDL was 
obtained. Four distinct bands with carbohydrate rich glycoconjugates were
identified in PKDL ICs, which were absent in VL and control group. It suggests
the scope for developing a novel differential diagnostic assay.

BACKGROUND: Children under the age of five are most vulnerable to malaria
(malaria is a major health challenge in sub-Saharan Africa) with a child dying
every 30 s from malaria. Hampered socio-economic development, poverty,
diseconomies of scale, marginalization, and exploitation are associated with
malaria. Therefore establishing determinants of malaria in affected sub-Saharan
populations is important in order to come up with informed interventions that
will be effective in malaria control.
METHODS: The study was a cross-sectional survey design based on data from the
Malawi 2012 Malaria indicator Survey obtained from Demographic and Health Survey 
(DHS) programme website. The outcome variable was positive laboratory-based blood
smear result for malaria in children less than 5 years, after an initial positive
rapid malaria diagnostic test done at the homestead. Statistical modelling was
done using survey logistic regression as well as generalized structural equation 
modelling (G-SEM) to analyse direct and indirect effects of malaria.
RESULTS: The propensity score matched data had 1 325 children with 367 (27.7%)
having blood smear positive malaria. Female children made up approximately 53% of
the total study participants. Child related variables (age, haemoglobin and
position in household) and household wealth index were significant directly and
indirectly. Further on G-SEM based multivariable analysis showed socio-economic
status (SES) [Odds ratio (OR) = 0.96, 95% Confidence interval (CI) = 0.92, 0.99] 
and primary level of education [OR = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.32, 0.77] were important
direct and indirect determinants of malaria morbidity.
CONCLUSION: Socio-economic status and education are important factors that
influence malaria control. These factors need to be taken into consideration when
planning malaria control programmes in order to have effective programmes. Direct
and indirect effect modelling can also provide an alternative modelling technique
that incorporates surrogate confounders that may not be significant when modelled
directly. This holistic approach is useful and will help in improving malaria
control.

Malaria Research (Field Station) (ICMR), Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, India.

BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Malaria is a major public health problem in many States 
of the country, particularly, in Madhya Pradesh where both Plasmodium vivax and
P. falciparum are endemic. Although many studies have been conducted to
investigate risk factors for malaria, but only a few have examined household and 
socio-economic risk factors. The present study was, therefore, undertaken to
explore the relationship of different socio-demographic, socio-economic and
behavioural risk factors with malaria prevalence in tribal areas of Madhya
Pradesh, India.
METHODS: This study was undertaken in all 62 villages of Bargi Primary Health
Centre from May 2005 to June 2008. These villages comprised 7117 households with 
an average family size of five members. Fortnightly fever surveys were conducted 
in all villages to assess prevalence of malaria infection in the community. The
distinct univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were fitted on
the data set.
RESULTS: The important socio-demographic risk factors like age of household head,
social group, occupation and family size; socio-economic factors like type of
walls of house, place of drinking water source, irrigated land, cash crop; and
behavioural variables like place of sleeping, use of bed nets, etc. were found
significantly associated with malaria in univariate analyses. In multivariate
analyses only social groups, family size, type of walls of house, and place of
sleeping had strong significant association with prevalence of malaria.
INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: The study shows that in tribal areas where people
are living in poor quality of houses with no proper use of preventive measures,
malaria is firmly established. We conclude that community based interventions
which bring improvement in standard of living, access to healthcare facilities
and health awareness, will have a significant impact on malaria prevention in
these areas.

BACKGROUND: In sub-Saharan Africa, malaria is a leading cause of morbidity and
mortality, which, during pregnancy, is associated with adverse health outcomes
for both mother and foetus. Utilization of Insecticide Treated Nets (ITNs) and
Intermittent Preventive Therapy (IPTp) is advocated to prevent malaria during
pregnancy.
OBJECTIVE: To examine factors which influence the use of different types of
malaria prevention methods among pregnant women in Kenya.
METHODS: This study used 2008-09 Kenya Demographic and Health survey. Pregnant
women aged 15-49 years were included (622 women). Distribution of the study
population was assessed in frequency tables. Bivariate and multivariate logistic 
regression analysis was employed.
RESULTS: Fifty-two percent of women used ITNs and 38.5% reported uptake of IPTp. 
In multivariate analysis age, malaria risk areas, religion, education and income 
influenced ITN usage, whereas only age, malaria risk areas and marital status
were found to influence IPTP uptake.
CONCLUSIONS: ITN use and IPTp uptake were well below the 80% Kenya Malaria
Strategy 2006 target. In an effort to increase uptake it is vital for future
research to understand reasons for low usage and uptake of malaria prevention
programmes so as to enable policy-makers to make informed decisions.

Anaemia prevalence may be reduced among countries that fortify flour.

Barkley JS, Wheeler KS, Pachón H.

Comment in
    Br J Nutr. 2015 Aug 28;114(4):501-2.

The effectiveness of flour fortification in reducing anaemia prevalence is
equivocal. The goal was to utilise the existing national-level data to assess
whether anaemia in non-pregnant women was reduced after countries began
fortifying wheat flour, alone or in combination with maize flour, with at least
Fe, folic acid, vitamin A or vitamin B12. Nationally representative anaemia data 
were identified through Demographic and Health Survey reports, the WHO Vitamin
and Mineral Nutrition Information System database and other national-level
nutrition surveys. Countries with at least two anaemia surveys were considered
for inclusion. Within countries, surveys were excluded if altitude was not
consistently adjusted for, or if the blood-draw site (e.g. capillary or venous)
or Hb quantification method (e.g. HemoCue or Cyanmethaemoglobin) differed.
Anaemia prevalence was modelled for countries that had pre- and
post-fortification data (n 12) and for countries that never fortified flour (n
20) using logistic regression models that controlled for time effects, human
development index (HDI) and endemic malaria. After adjusting for HDI and malaria,
each year of fortification was associated with a 2.4% reduction in the odds of
anaemia prevalence (PR 0.976, 95% CI 0.975, 0.978). Among countries that never
fortified, no reduction in the odds of anaemia prevalence over time was observed 
(PR 0.999, 95% CI 0.997, 1.002). Among both fortification and non-fortification
countries, HDI and malaria were significantly associated with anaemia (P,0.001). 
Although this type of evidence precludes a definitive conclusion, results suggest
that after controlling for time effects, HDI and endemic malaria, anaemia
prevalence has decreased significantly in countries that fortify flour with
micronutrients, while remaining unchanged in countries that do not.

BACKGROUND: The most effective strategies in the fight against malaria are to
correctly diagnose and timely treat the illness. A diagnosis based on clinical
symptoms alone is subjected to misuse of anti-malarial drugs, increased costs to 
the health services, patient dissatisfaction and also contributes to an increase 
in non-malaria morbidity and mortality. Among others, inappropriate perception
and inadequate satisfaction of patients are significant challenges reported to
affect the quality of laboratory malaria diagnostic services.
METHODS: A facility-based, cross-sectional study was conducted from November to
December 2013 among 300 patients. Their level of satisfaction was measured using 
both pre-tested structured and open ended questionnaires. A 5-point Likert scales
and their weighted average were used to categorize satisfaction level of the
patients. Data were entered in Epi-Info version 3.5.3 and analysed using SPSS
version 20. Chi-square test was used to see the association between the outcome
variable and independent and the strength of the association was identified using
odds ratio in the binary logistic regression. In addition the open ended
questionnaire findings were coded and analysed thematically.
RESULTS: Over half (52.6%) of the patients were satisfied with the malaria
diagnostic service with a 98.7% response rate. The majority (89.3%) of patients
perceived they were well diagnosed in facing fever upon giving blood for
laboratory malaria diagnosis within 30 min waiting time in most (62.5%) of the
patients. Ethnicity, residence, knowing malaria diagnosis after consulting
clinician, and time period to receive malaria result were the independent
predictors for patient satisfaction (p<0.05). The open ended questionnaire
responses also revealed providing precise laboratory result timely, availability 
of the right treatment, presence of health professionals performing the
laboratory test upon request in the health facility were among the major enabling
factors for patients' satisfaction.
CONCLUSION: The observed level of satisfaction in the current study though
encouraging when compared with some previous studies conducted in eastern
Ethiopia on general laboratory services, still it requires scale-up in the
enhancement of malaria laboratory diagnostic service in the fight against
malaria.

BACKGROUND: Many school children living in Africa are infected with plasmodia and
helminth species and are consequently at risk of coinfection. However, the
epidemiology of such coinfection and the implications of coinfection for
children's health remain poorly understood. This study describes the epidemiology
of Ascaris lumbricoides-Plasmodium and hookworm-Plasmodium coinfection among
school children living in western Kenya and investigates the associated risk
factors.
METHODS: As part of a randomized trial, a baseline cross-sectional survey was
conducted among school children aged 5-18 years in 23 schools in Bumula District.
Single stool samples were collected to screen for helminth infections using the
Kato-Katz technique and malaria parasitaemia was determined from a finger prick
blood sample. Demographic and anthropometric data were also collected.
RESULTS: Overall, 46.4% of the children were infected with Plasmodium falciparum 
while 27.6% of the children were infected with at least one soil transmitted
helminth (STH) species, with hookworm being the most common (16.8%) followed by
A. lumbricoides (15.3%). Overall 14.3% of the children had STH-Plasmodium
coinfection, with hookworm-Plasmodium (9.0%) coinfection being the most common.
Geographical variation in the prevalence of coinfection occurred between schools.
In multivariable logistic regression analysis, hookworm was positively associated
with P. falciparum infection. In stratified analysis, hookworm infection was
associated with increased odds of P. falciparum infection among both boys
(P < 0.001) and girls (P = 0.01), whereas there was no association between A.
lumbricoides and P. falciparum.
CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate STH infections are still prevalent,
despite the ongoing national deworming programme in Kenya, and that malaria
parasitaemia is widespread, such that coinfection occurs among a proportion of
children. A subsequent trial will allow us to investigate the implications of
coinfection for the risk of clinical malaria.

Global Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.

CONTEXT: Use of Immunization information systems (IISs) by providers can improve 
vaccination rates by identifying missed opportunities. However, provider
reporting of children's vaccination histories to IISs remains suboptimal.
OBJECTIVE: To assess factors associated with provider reporting to an IIS.
DESIGN: Analysis of 2006-2012 National Immunization Survey (NIS) and NIS-Teen
data. NIS and NIS-Teen are ongoing random-digit-dial telephone surveys of
households with children and adolescents, respectively, followed by a mail survey
to providers to obtain the patient's vaccination history.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 115 285 children aged 19 to 35 months and 83
612 adolescents aged 13 to 17 years and their immunization providers in the
United States.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The percentage of children and adolescents with 1 or more 
providers reporting to or obtaining vaccination information from their local
IISs. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine patient and provider 
factors associated with provider reporting to IISs and adjusted prevalence of
children and adolescents with 1 or more providers reporting to IISs.
RESULTS: In 2012, 79.4% of children and 77.4% of adolescents had 1 or more
providers report any of their vaccination data to an IIS, and 41.9% of children
and 51.5% of adolescents had providers who obtained any of their vaccination
histories from an IIS. During 2006-2012, children and adolescents were more
likely to have any of their vaccination data reported to an IIS if they received 
care from all public versus all private providers (children: 84.4% vs 69.6%, P < 
.0001; adolescents: 84.6% vs 66.4%, P < .0001), had 1 or more providers who
ordered vaccines from a state or local health department (children: 76.7% vs
59.5%, P < .0001; adolescents: 77.0% vs 55.6%, P < .0001), or had 1 or more
providers obtain vaccination information from the IIS (children: 86.1% vs 71.2%, 
P < .0001; adolescents: 83.7% vs 64.6%, P < .0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Health department staff should target providers less likely to use
IIS services, including private providers, and providers not ordering vaccines
from health departments to ensure they use IIS services.

Many entomological studies have analyzed remotely sensed data to assess the
relationship between malaria vector distribution and the associated environmental
factors. However, the high cost of remotely sensed products with high spatial
resolution has often resulted in analyses being conducted at coarse scales using 
open-source, archived remotely sensed data. In the present study, spatial
prediction of potential breeding sites based on multi-scale remotely sensed
information in conjunction with entomological data with special reference to
presence or absence of larvae was realized. Selected water bodies were tested for
mosquito larvae using the larva scooping method, and the results were compared
with data on land cover, rainfall, land surface temperature (LST) and altitude
presented with high spatial resolution. To assess which environmental factors
best predict larval presence or absence, Decision Tree methodology and logistic
regression techniques were applied. Both approaches showed that some
environmental predictors can reliably distinguish between the two alternatives
(existence and non-existence of larvae). For example, the results suggest that
larvae are mainly present in very small water pools related to human activities, 
such as subsistence farming that were also found to be the major determinant for 
vector breeding. Rainfall, LST and altitude, on the other hand, were less useful 
as a basis for mapping the distribution of breeding sites. In conclusion, we
found that models linking presence of larvae with high-resolution land use have
good predictive ability of identifying potential breeding sites.

BACKGROUND: Tanzania adopted Intermittent-preventive treatment of malaria in
pregnancy (IPTp) policy in 2000; the guidelines at the time of the study
recommended the timing of the first dose of intermittent preventive treatment in 
pregnancy (IPTp) with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) (IPTp-SP) at 20-24 weeks and
the timing of the second dose at 28-32 weeks. The aim of this study was to
identify factors that are responsible for the uptake of IPTp among pregnant
Tanzanian women. Further, this study aims to justify the need for appropriate
interventions that would strengthen the Tanzanian IPTp program towards the
realization of the Roll Back Malaria (RBM) targets.
METHODS: Data were analyzed from the 2011-2012 Tanzania HIV and Malaria
Indicators Survey (THMIS) of 1,616 women aged 15-49 years who had a live birth in
the 2 years prior to the survey and received antenatal care (ANC) services.
RESULTS: Logistic regression analysis results showed that (1) being in the age
groups 30-34 and 35-39 versus other age groups and being married or living with
partner versus those who reported as never married or divorced/separated were
associated with high uptake of IPTp; (2) women pregnant with their first or
second child versus those who already have had two or more children had higher
odds of completing the recommended number of IPTp dosage; and (3) being a
resident from the Eastern Zone versus Lake Zone as well as having the first
antenatal visit in the first or second trimester versus third trimester were
associated with higher uptake of IPTp.
CONCLUSION: Applying these results could contribute to positive social change by 
helping providers, clinics, and organizations seeking to increase IPTp uptake
among ANC attendees and providing health education programs to women, especially 
those residing in rural areas. This study could also help achieve United Nations 
Millennium Development Goals (MDG) 6 (combat HIV/AIDS, Malaria and Other
Diseases).

Resistance to antibiotics is increasing globally and is a threat to public
health. Research has demonstrated a correlation between antibiotic use and
resistance development. Developing countries are the most affected by resistance 
because of high infectious disease burden, limited access to quality assured
antibiotics and more optimal drugs and poor antibiotic use practices. The
appropriate use of antibiotics to slow the pace of resistance development is
crucial. The study retrospectively assessed antibiotic prescription practices in 
four public and private primary health-care facilities in Eastern Region, Ghana
using the WHO/International Network for the Rational Use of Drugs rational drug
use indicators. Using a systematic sampling procedure, 400 prescriptions were
selected per facility for the period April 2010 to March 2011. Rational drug use 
indicators were assessed in the descriptive analysis and logistic regression was 
used to explore for predictors of antibiotic prescription. Average number of
medicines prescribed per encounter was 4.01, and 59.9% of prescriptions had
antibiotics whilst 24.2% had injections. In total, 79.2% and 88.1% of prescribed 
medicines were generics and from the national essential medicine list,
respectively. In the multivariate analysis, health facility type (odds ratio
[OR] = 2.05; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.42, 2.95), patient age (OR = 0.97;
95% CI: 0.97, 0.98), number of medicines on a prescription (OR = 1.85; 95% CI:
1.63, 2.10) and 'no malaria drug' on prescription (OR = 5.05; 95% CI: 2.08,
12.25) were associated with an antibiotic prescription. A diagnosis of upper
respiratory tract infection was positively associated with antibiotic use. The
level of antibiotic use varied depending on the health facility type and was
generally high compared with the national average estimated in 2008.
Interventions that reduce diagnostic uncertainty in illness management should be 
considered. The National Health Insurance Scheme, as the main purchaser of health
services in Ghana, offers an opportunity that should be exploited to introduce
policies in support of rational drug use.

Globalization and environmental change, social and demographic determinants and
health system capacity are significant drivers of infectious diseases which can
also act as epidemic precursors. Thus, monitoring changes in these drivers can
help anticipate, or even forecast, an upsurge of infectious diseases. The
European Environment and Epidemiology (E3) Network has been built for this
purpose and applied to three early warning case studies: (1) The environmental
suitability of malaria transmission in Greece was mapped in order to target
epidemiological and entomological surveillance and vector control activities.
Malaria transmission in these areas was interrupted in 2013 through such
integrated preparedness and response activities. (2) Since 2010, recurrent West
Nile fever outbreaks have ensued in South/eastern Europe. Temperature deviations 
from a thirty year average proved to be associated with the 2010 outbreak.
Drivers of subsequent outbreaks were computed through multivariate logistic
regression models and included monthly temperature anomalies for July and a
normalized water index. (3) Dengue is a tropical disease but sustained
transmission has recently emerged in Madeira. Autochthonous transmission has also
occurred repeatedly in France and in Croatia mainly due to travel importation.
The risk of dengue importation into Europe in 2010 was computed with the volume
of international travelers from dengue affected areas worldwide.These prototype
early warning systems indicate that monitoring drivers of infectious diseases can
help predict vector-borne disease threats.

BACKGROUND: Malaria causes variety of adverse consequences in pregnant women due 
to invasion of the placenta by Plasmodium. It increases the risk of adverse
pregnancy outcome for the mother, the foetus and the new-born. Therefore,
knowledge, attitudes and practices of this vulnerable group about malaria and the
effective use of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) contribute to sustainable
control of the disease and its effects.
METHODS: A community based cross-sectional study was carried out in May, 2014. A 
validated structured questionnaire was used for data collection. The data was
analysed using logistic regression by means of STATA version 11 data analysis
software.
RESULTS: A total of 398 pregnant women participated in the study and their
overall knowledge and attitude towards malaria and ITNs was fairly good; 74.3 %
of the mothers had good knowledge and 51.1 % of them possessed positive attitude.
Nevertheless, only 15.6 % of the mothers associated mosquitoes with malaria and
majority of them (65.6 %) responded that it is transmitted due to poor personal
hygiene and environmental sanitation. Younger age, receiving information and
information obtained from health extension workers and media were found to be
important predictors of pregnant women's attitude (P < 0.05). The ITNs
utilization was poor. Only 15.8 % of 398 mothers owned at least one ITN. This was
due to its unavailability in markets and unsustainable distribution. More than
half of the mothers who owned the ITNs did not have a number proportional to
their family size, and 52 % of the mothers had not slept under bed net the
previous night. This was due to its being dirty, old, had holes and in some cases
lack of awareness on how to install it and its importance to prevent malaria.
Higher education was identified as the determining factor for ITNs utilization
(P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Even though the pregnant mothers' knowledge and attitude about
malaria and ITNs was fairly good, its ownership and utilization was noticeably
very low. Therefore, consistent and timely distribution by the government and
other funding agencies is promptly needed. In addition, appropriate health
education should be given on the link between malaria and mosquito, regular and
correct use of ITNs with special focus to uneducated and elderly mothers.

BACKGROUND: Enterobius vermicularis infection is a prevalent intestinal parasitic
disease in children. In this study, we explored the epidemiological status and
risk factors for E. vermicularis infection in children in southern China.
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was carried out in Gaozhou city, Guangdong
province, China, in December 2011. Children aged 2-12 years from five schools
participated in the study. The adhesive cellophane-tape perianal swab method was 
applied to detect E. vermicularis infection, while a questionnaire was sent to
each child's guardian(s) to collect demographic and socioeconomic data, as well
as hygiene behaviors, pertaining to each child. Univariate and multivariate
logistic regression analyses were performed to capture the potential risk
factors.
RESULTS: Out of the 802 children surveyed, 440 were infected with E.
vermicularis, with an average prevalence of 54.86 %, and a range from 45.96 to
68.13 %. The age variable was found to be statistically significant, whereas the 
sex variable was not. It was found that a mother's education level (low) and not 
washing hands before dinner were major risk factors in all children (802). After 
stratification by age, a father's education level (primary or below) and biting
pencils (or toys) were significant risk factors in the younger children (508),
while not washing hands before dinner and playing on the ground were important
risk factors in the older children (294).
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the prevalence of E. vermicularis infection
in children in Gaozhou and reveals underlying risk factors. Most importantly, it 
reveals that risk factors differ among the different age groups, which indicates 
that different control measures targeted at particular age groups should be
implemented.

BACKGROUND: A better understanding of case management practices is required to
improve inpatient pediatric care in resource-limited settings. Here we utilize
data from a unique health facility-based surveillance system at six Ugandan
hospitals to evaluate the quality of pediatric case management and the factors
associated with appropriate care.
METHODS: All children up to the age of 14 years admitted to six district or
regional hospitals over 15 months were included in the study. Four case
management categories were defined for analysis: suspected malaria, selected
illnesses requiring antibiotics, suspected anemia, and diarrhea. The quality of
case management for each category was determined by comparing recorded treatments
with evidence-based best practices as defined in national guidelines.
Associations between variables of interest and the receipt of appropriate case
management were estimated using multivariable logistic regression.
RESULTS: A total of 30,351 admissions were screened for inclusion in the
analysis. Ninety-two percent of children met criteria for suspected malaria and
81% received appropriate case management. Thirty-two percent of children had
selected illnesses requiring antibiotics and 89% received appropriate
antibiotics. Thirty percent of children met criteria for suspected anemia and 38%
received appropriate case management. Twelve percent of children had diarrhea and
18% received appropriate case management. Multivariable logistic regression
revealed large differences in the quality of care between health facilities.
There was also a strong association between a positive malaria diagnostic test
result and the odds of receiving appropriate case management for comorbid
non-malarial illnesses - children with a positive malaria test were more likely
to receive appropriate care for anemia and less likely for illnesses requiring
antibiotics and diarrhea.
CONCLUSIONS: Appropriate management of suspected anemia and diarrhea occurred
infrequently. Pediatric quality improvement initiatives should target
deficiencies in care unique to each health facility, and interventions should
focus on the simultaneous management of multiple diagnoses.

BACKGROUND: Myanmar is one of the 31 highest burden malaria countries worldwide. 
Scaling up the appropriate use of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) is a national
policy for malaria prevention and control. However, the data on use, influencing 
factors and maintenance of bed nets is still lack among the population in Kachin 
Special Region II (KR2), Northeastern Myanmar.
METHODS: The study combined a quantitative household questionnaire survey and
qualitative direct observation of households. A Chi-squared test was used to
compare the percentages of ownership, coverage, and rates of use of bed nets.
Additionally, multivariate logistic regression analysis (MVLRA) was used to
analyse factors that influence the use of bed nets. Finally, covariance compared 
the mean calibrated hole indexes (MCHI) across potential influence variables.
RESULTS: The bed net to person ratio was 1:1.96 (i.e., more than one net for
every two people). The long-lasting insecticidal net (LLIN) to person ratio was
1: 2.52. Also, the percentage of households that owned at least one bed net was
99.7% (666/688). Some 3262 (97.3%) residents slept under bed nets the prior
night, 2551 (76.1%) of which slept under ITNs/LLINs the prior night (SUITNPN).
The poorest families, those with thatched roofing, those who use agriculture as
their main source of family income, household heads who knew that mosquitoes
transmit malaria and those who used bed nets to prevent malaria, were
significantly more likely to be in the SUITNPN group. However, residents in
lowlands, and foothills were significantly less likely to be SUITNPNs. Finally,
head of household attitude towards fixing bed nets influenced MCHI (F=8.09,
P=0.0046).
CONCLUSIONS: The coverage and usage rates of bed nets were high, especially among
children, and pregnant women. Family wealth index, geographical zones, household 
roofing, source of family income, household head's knowledge of malaria
transmission and of using bed nets as tools for malaria prevention are all
independent factors which influence use of ITNs/LLINs in KR2. Maintaining high
coverage, and use rate of bed nets should be a priority for the war-torn
population of KR2 to ensure equity and human rights.

OBJECTIVE: Hair concentrations are a noninvasive measure of cumulative
antiretroviral exposure and the strongest predictor of viral suppression in large
cohorts of nonpregnant patients. We examined hair concentrations of
antiretrovirals in relation to virologic outcomes in pregnant and breastfeeding
women for the first time.
DESIGN AND METHODS: The Prevention of Malaria and HIV Disease in Tororo trial
(NCT00993031) enrolled HIV-infected pregnant Ugandan women at 12-28 weeks
gestation who were randomized to lopinavir or efavirenz-based antiretroviral
therapy (ART). Small hair samples were collected at 30-34 weeks gestation and
10-25 weeks postpartum. Efavirenz and lopinavir hair concentrations were measured
via liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Multivariate logistic
regression models examined predictors of viral suppression (HIV-1 RNA
≤400 copies/ml) at delivery and 24 weeks postpartum.
RESULTS: Among 325 women, median CD4 cell count was 366 cells/μl (interquartile
range 270-488) at ART initiation. Mean self-reported 3-day adherence was greater 
than 97% in each arm. Viral suppression was achieved by 98.0% (efavirenz) and
87.4% (lopinavir) at delivery. At 24 weeks postpartum, 92.5% (efavirenz) and
90.6% (lopinavir) achieved viral suppression; 88% of women were breastfeeding. In
multivariate models including self-reported adherence and pretreatment HIV-1 RNA,
antiretroviral hair concentrations were the strongest predictor of viral
suppression at delivery [efavirenz: adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.86 per doubling
in concentration, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.14-3.1, P = 0.013; lopinavir:
aOR 1.90, 95% CI 1.33-2.7, P = 0.0004] and 24 weeks postpartum (efavirenz: aOR
1.81, 95% CI 1.22-2.7, P = 0.003; lopinavir: aOR 1.53, 95% CI 1.05-2.2,
P = 0.026).
CONCLUSION: Antiretroviral hair concentrations represent an innovative tool that 
strongly predicts viral suppression among HIV-infected childbearing women during 
the critical periods of delivery and breastfeeding.

Although co-infection of tuberculosis (TB) and intestinal parasites, including
protozoa and helminths, in humans has been widely studied globally, very little
of this phenomenon is known in China. Therefore, a cross-sectional study was
conducted in a rural county of China to investigate such co-infections. Patients 
with pulmonary TB (PTB) undergoing anti-Mycobacterium tuberculosis (anti-MTB)
treatment were surveyed by questionnaires, and their feces and blood specimens
were collected for detection of intestinal protozoa and helminths, routine blood 
examination and HIV detection. The χ(2) test and multivariate logistic regression
model were used to identify risk factors. A total of 369 patients with PTB were
included and all of them were HIV negative. Overall, only 7.3% of participants
were infected with intestinal protozoa, among which prevalence of Blastocystis
hominis, Entamoeba spp. and Trichomonas hominis were 6.0%, 1.1% and 0.3%,
respectively; 7.0% were infected with intestinal helminths, among which
prevalence of hookworm, Trichuris trichiura, Ascaris lumbricoides and Clonorchis 
sinensis were 4.3%, 1.9%, 0.5% and 0.3%, respectively; and 0.5% were
simultaneously infected with intestinal protozoa and helminths. Among patients
with PTB, body mass index (BMI)≤18 (OR=3.30, 95% CI=1.44-7.54) and raised poultry
or livestock (e.g., chicken, duck, pig) (OR=3.96, 95% CI=1.32-11.89) were
significantly associated with harboring intestinal protozoan infection, while
BMI≤18 (OR=3.32, 95% CI=1.39-7.91), anemia (OR=3.40, 95% CI=1.44-8.02) and
laboring barefoot in farmlands (OR=4.54, 95% CI=1.88-10.92) were significantly
associated with having intestinal helminth infection. Additionally, there was no 
significant relationship between duration of anti-MTB treatment and infection
rates of intestinal parasites including protozoa and helminths. Therefore,
preventing malnutrition, avoiding unprotected contact with reservoirs of
protozoa, and improving health education for good hygiene habits, particularly
wearing shoes while outdoors, are beneficial in the prevention of intestinal
protozoan and helminth infection among patients with PTB.

BACKGROUND: The human landing catches is the gold standard method used to study
the vectors of malaria and to estimate their aggressiveness. However, this method
has raised safety concerns due to a possible increased risk of malaria or other
mosquito-borne diseases among the mosquito collectors. The aim of this study was 
to evaluate the incidence of malaria attacks among mosquito collectors and to
compare these results with those of non-collectors in a Senegalese village.
METHODS: From July 1990 to December 2011, a longitudinal malaria study involving 
mosquito collectors and non-collectors was performed in Dielmo village, Senegal. 
During the study period, 4 drugs were successively used to treat clinical
malaria, and long-lasting insecticide-treated nets were offered to all villagers 
in July 2008. No malaria chemoprophylaxis was given to mosquito collectors.
Incidence of uncomplicated clinical malaria and asymptomatic malaria infection
were analyzed among these two groups while controlling for confounding factors
associated with malaria risk in random effects negative binomial and logistic
regression models, respectively.
RESULTS: A total of 3,812 person-trimester observations of 199 adults at least 15
years of age were analyzed. Clinical malaria attacks accounted for 6.3% both in
collectors and non-collectors, and asymptomatic malaria infections accounted for 
21% and 20% in collectors and non-collectors, respectively. A non-significant
lower risk of malaria was observed in the collector group in comparison with the 
non-collector group after adjusting for other risk factors of malaria and
endemicity level (Clinical malaria: adjusted incidence rate ratio = 0.89; 95%
confidence interval = 0.65-1.22; p= 0.47).
CONCLUSION: Being a mosquito collector in Dielmo was not significantly associated
with an increased risk of malaria both under holoendemic, mesoendemic and
hypoendemic conditions of malaria epidemiology. This result supports the view
that HLC, the most accurate method for evaluating malaria transmission, may be
used without health concerns in Dielmo.

BACKGROUND: Haemoglobin variants, Sickle (HbS) and foetal (HbF) have been
associated with malaria protection. This study explores epistatic interactions
between HbS and HbF on malaria infection.
METHODS: The study was conducted between March 2004 and December 2013 within the 
sickle cell disease (SCD) programme at Muhimbili National Hospital, Tanzania. SCD
status was categorized into HbAA, HbAS and HbSS using hemoglobin electrophoresis 
and High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). HbF levels were determined by 
HPLC. Malaria was diagnosed using rapid diagnostic test and/or blood film.
Logistic regression and generalized estimating equations models were used to
evaluate associations between SCD status, HbF and malaria.
FINDINGS: 2,049 individuals with age range 0-70 years, HbAA 311(15.2%), HbAS
241(11.8%) and HbSS 1,497(73.1%) were analysed. At enrolment, malaria prevalence 
was significantly higher in HbAA 13.2% compared to HbAS 1.24% and HbSS 1.34%
(p<0.001). Mean HbF was lower in those with malaria compared to those without
malaria in HbAA (0.43% vs 0.82%) but was the reverse in HbSS (8.10% vs 5.59%). An
increase in HbF was associated with a decrease in risk of malaria OR=0.50 (95%CI:
0.28, 0.90; p=0.021) in HbAA, whereas for HbSS the risk of malaria increased
OR=2.94 (1.44, 5.98; p=0.003). A similar pattern was seen during multiple visits;
HbAA OR=0.52 (0.34, 0.80; p=0.003) vs HbSS OR=2.01 (1.27, 3.23; p=0.003).
CONCLUSION: Higher prevalence of malaria in HbAA compared to HbAS and HbSS
confirmed the protective effect of HbS. Lower prevalence of malaria in HbAA with 
high HbF supports a protective effect of HbF. However, in HbSS, the higher
prevalence of malaria with high levels of HbF suggests loss of malaria
protection. This is the first epidemiological study to suggest a negative
epistasis between HbF and HbS on malaria.

BACKGROUND: Although the burden of malaria has significantly declined in recent
years in sub-Saharan Africa through the widespread use of long-lasting
insecticide treated bed-nets (LLINs) and artemisinin-based combination therapy,
resurgence of malaria is observed in some settings after several years of LLINs
use. This study aimed to assess if LLINs use remains protective against malaria
during a period of resurgence of malaria morbidity in Dielmo, a rural village of 
Senegal.
METHODS: In July 2008, LLINs were offered to all villagers and lately in July
2011, LLINs were renewed. A longitudinal study was conducted between July, 2010
and December, 2011 among inhabitants of the village of Dielmo to identify all
episodes of fever. Thick smears stained with Giemsa were done for every febrile
villager and malaria attacks were treated with combination of Artesunate plus
Amodiaquine. Cross-sectional surveys were also conducted at the end of the rainy 
season (October 2010 and November 2011) to assess asymptomatic carriage. A survey
on LLINs use was done every quarter of the year. A random-effect logistic
regression was used to assess the effect of LLINs use on the risk of having a
malaria attack after adjusting for the main risk factors.
RESULTS: The study population included 449 individuals corresponding to a total
of 2140 observations. One hundred and fifteen (115) clinical malaria attacks
attributed to P. falciparum (cases) have been recorded over the study period.
Most of the malaria cases occurred in October-December 2010 (49/115 i.e. 43%) and
among adults aged 15 years and over (50/115, i.e. 43%). During the study period, 
the use of LLINs was 61% among non-malaria cases and only 42% among malaria
clinical cases but differenced according to age group. After adjusting on gender,
age, rainfall and LLINs replacement, we found that LLINs use (AOR [95%CI] = 0.40 
[0.25; 0.62], p < 0.001) remained a protective factor against malaria attacks
during the study period.
CONCLUSION: LLINs use remains effective to reduce malaria burden. These results
highlight the need to pursue LLINs implementation in the current context of
malaria elimination and to provide positive incentives to increase its use in the
population.

BACKGROUND: Endemic malaria in Thailand continues to only exist along
international borders. This pattern is frequently attributed to importation of
malaria from surrounding nations. A microgeographical approach was used to
investigate malaria cases in a study village along the Thailand-Myanmar border.
METHODS: Three mass blood surveys were conducted during the study period (July
and December 2011, and May 2012) and were matched to a cohort-based demographic
surveillance system. Blood slides and filter papers were taken from each
participant. Slides were cross-verified by an expert microscopist and filter
papers were analysed using nested PCR. Cases were then mapped to households and
analysed using spatial statistics. A risk factor analysis was done using mixed
effects logistic regression.
RESULTS: In total, 55 Plasmodium vivax and 20 Plasmodium falciparum cases (out of
547 participants) were detected through PCR, compared to six and two
(respectively) cases detected by field microscopy. The single largest risk factor
for infection was citizenship. Many study participants were ethnic Karen people
with no citizenship in either Thailand or Myanmar. This subpopulation had over
eight times the odds of malaria infection when compared to Thai citizens. Cases
also appeared to cluster near a major drainage system and year-round water source
within the study village.
CONCLUSION: This research indicates that many cases of malaria remain undiagnosed
in the region. The spatial and demographic clustering of cases in a sub-group of 
the population indicates either transmission within the Thai village or shared
exposure to malaria vectors outside of the village. While it is possible that
malaria is imported to Thailand from Myanmar, the existence of undetected
infections, coupled with an ecological setting that is conducive to malaria
transmission, means that indigenous transmission could also occur on the Thai
side of the border. Improved, timely, and active case detection is warranted.

BACKGROUND: In 2010, WHO revised guidelines to recommend testing all suspected
malaria cases prior to treatment. Yet, evidence to assess programmes is largely
derived from limited facility settings in a limited number of countries. National
surveys from 12 sub-Saharan African countries were used to examine the effect of 
diagnostic testing on medicines used by febrile children under five years at the 
population level, including stratification by malaria risk, transmission season, 
source of care, symptoms, and age.
METHODS: Data were compiled from 12 Demographic and Health Surveys in 2010-2012
that reported fever prevalence, diagnostic test and medicine use, and
socio-economic covariates (n=16,323 febrile under-fives taken to care).
Mixed-effects logistic regression models quantified the influence of diagnostic
testing on three outcomes (artemisinin combination therapy (ACT), any
anti-malarial or any antibiotic use) after adjusting for data clustering and
confounding covariates. For each outcome, interactions between diagnostic testing
and the following covariates were separately tested: malaria risk, season, source
of care, symptoms, and age. A multiple case study design was used to understand
varying results across selected countries and sub-national groups, which drew on 
programme documents, published research and expert consultations. A descriptive
typology of plausible explanations for quantitative results was derived from a
cross-case synthesis.
RESULTS: Significant variability was found in the effect of diagnostic testing on
ACT use across countries (e.g., Uganda OR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.66-1.06; Mozambique
OR: 3.54, 95% CI: 2.33-5.39). Four main themes emerged to explain results:
available diagnostics and medicines; quality of care; care-seeking behaviour;
and, malaria epidemiology.
CONCLUSIONS: Significant country variation was found in the effect of diagnostic 
testing on paediatric fever treatment at the population level, and qualitative
results suggest the impact of diagnostic scale-up on treatment practices may not 
be straightforward in routine conditions given contextual factors (e.g., access
to care, treatment-seeking behaviour or supply stock-outs). Despite limitations, 
quantitative results could help identify countries (e.g., Mozambique) or issues
(e.g., malaria risk) where facility-based research or programme attention may be 
warranted. The mixed-methods approach triangulates different evidence to
potentially provide a standard framework to assess routine programmes across
countries or over time to fill critical evidence gaps.

INTRODUCTION: Regular evaluations of communities' understanding of
malaria-related practices are essential for control of the disease in endemic
areas. This study was aimed at investigating the perceptions, prevention and
treatments practices for childhood malaria by mothers in rural communities.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a community-based cross-sectional study at
rural communities of Ise-Orun local Government area, Nigeria. We randomly sampled
422 mothers of children less than 5 years and administered a validated
questionnaire to assess their perceptions and practices relating to childhood
malaria. We used a 10-point scale to assess perception and classified it as good 
(≥5) or poor (<5). Predictive factors for poor perceptions were identified using 
logistic regression.
RESULTS: Approximately 51% of the mothers had poor perception and 14.2% ascribed 
malaria illness to mosquito bite only. Majority (85.8%) of the mothers practiced 
malaria preventive measures, including: Insecticide treated nets (70.0%),
chemoprophylaxis (20.1%) and environmental sanitation (44.8%). Of the 200 mothers
whose children had malaria fever within the 3 months prior to the study visits,
home treatment was adopted by 87.5%. Local herbal remedies were combined with
orthodox medicine in the treatments of malaria for 91.5% of the children. The
main reasons for not seeking medical treatment at existing formal health
facilities were "high cost", "challenges of access to facilities" and "mothers'
preference for herbal remedies". Lack of formal education was the only
independent predictor of poor malaria perceptions among mothers (OR = 1.91, 95%
CI = 1.18, 3.12).
CONCLUSIONS: Considerable misconceptions about malaria exist among mothers in the
rural communities. The implications for malaria control in holoendemic areas are 
highlighted.

BACKGROUND: In Uganda, treatment of clinical malaria and intermittent preventive 
treatment with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) are common during pregnancy. As a 
result, both formal and informal reports from antenatal sources suggest possible 
misuse of SP for malaria treatment among pregnant women. The objective of this
study was to investigate anti-malarial drug use patterns among women who had
recently suffered malaria illness before and during pregnancy.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study in which a structured questionnaire
(interviewer-administered) was used to collect data from pregnant women attending
an urban antenatal clinic. Details of medicines used to treat malaria episodes
suffered before and during pregnancy were captured. A first order Markov
probability model was used to estimate probabilities of transitioning between
treatment choices made before and during pregnancy. Logistic regression was used 
to explore whether demographic and obstetric characteristics were associated with
transition patterns.
RESULTS: Seven hundred women were interviewed among whom 428 had suffered malaria
in both instances. Three hundred thirty of these could recall the medicines used 
in both instances. Women who used ACT/QNN (correct choice) before pregnancy had
higher probabilities of transitioning to SP than staying on ACT/QNN during
pregnancy (0.463 versus 0.451). Access of medicines from private outlets (clinics
and pharmacies) were more than nine times predictive of receiving correct
medicines (p=0.035 and p=0.039 respectively). Access of medicines from clinics
was 5.9 times protective against receiving SP for malaria treatment (p=0.033).
Among those who used SP before pregnancy, there was a 0.75 probability of staying
on it during pregnancy. None of the factors explored could explain this
observation.
CONCLUSION: Use of SP for malaria treatment is common during pregnancy. This may 
be contributing to adverse pregnancy outcomes. Antenatal care providers should
endeavour to emphasize the distinction between treatment and prevention of
malaria during pregnancy.

We have previously found that children heterozygous for IL4 variable-number
tandem repeat (VNTR) (rs8179190) or IL4-33 (rs2070874) variants were at risk for 
severe malaria (SM), whereas homozygous children were protected suggesting a
complex genetic control. Hence, to dissect this complex genetic control of IL4
VNTR and IL4-33, we performed further investigation by conditional logistic
regression analysis and found a strong interaction between both markers (p <
10(-6)). The best-fit model revealed three genotype combinations associated with 
different levels of SM risk. The highest risk (odds ratio (OR) = 4.8, 95%
confidence interval (CI) = 2.0-11.5) was observed for subjects carrying at least 
one copy of both IL4-33 allele T and IL4 VNTR allele 1, who exhibited higher
interleukin (IL)-4 plasma levels (p = 0.007). Children homozygous for IL4 VNTR
allele 2 had a lower SM risk as well as lower IL-4 plasma levels. Our findings
indicate that the genetic interaction between these two IL-4 variants is a key
factor of SM susceptibility, probably because of its direct role in IL-4
regulation.

BACKGROUND: Home management of uncomplicated malaria (HMM) is now integrated into
the community case management of childhood illness (CCM), an approach that
requires parasitological diagnosis before treatment. The success of CCM in
resource-constrained settings without access to parasitological testing
significantly depends on the caregiver's ability to recognise malaria in children
under five years (U5), assess its severity, and initiate early treatment with the
use of effective antimalarial drugs in the appropriate regimen at home. Little is
known about factors that influence effective presumptive treatment of malaria in 
U5 by caregivers in resource-constrained malaria endemic areas. This study
examined the factors associated with appropriate HMM in U5 by caregivers in rural
Kassena-Nankana district, northern Ghana.
METHODS: A cross-sectional household survey was conducted among 811 caregivers
recruited through multistage sampling. A caregiver was reported to have practiced
appropriate HMM if an antimalarial drug was administered to a febrile child in
the recommended regimen (correct dose and duration for the child's age). Binary
logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with appropriate
HMM.
RESULTS: Of the 811 caregivers, 87% recognised the symptoms of uncomplicated
malaria in U5, and 49% (n = 395) used antimalarial drugs for the HMM. Fifty
percent (n = 197) of caregivers who administered antimalarial drugs used the
appropriate regimen. In the multivariate logistic regression, caregivers with
secondary (OR = 1.71, 95% CI: 1.03, 2.83) and tertiary (OR = 3.58, 95% CI: 1.08, 
11.87) education had increased odds of practicing appropriate HMM compared with
those with no formal education. Those who sought treatment in the hospital for
previous febrile illness in U5 had increased odds of practicing appropriate HMM
(OR = 2.24, 95% CI: 1.12, 4.60) compared with those who visited the health
centres.
CONCLUSIONS: Half of caregivers who used antimalarial drugs practiced appropriate
HMM. Educational status and utilisation of hospitals in previous illness were
associated with appropriate HMM. Health education programmes that promote the use
of the current first line antimalarial drugs in the appropriate regimen should be
targeted at caregivers with no education in order to improve HMM in communities
where parasitological diagnosis of malaria may not be feasible.

BACKGROUND: Although malaria is preventable and treatable, it still claims
660,000 lives every year globally with children under five years of age having
the highest burden. In Zambia, malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) that only
detect Plasmodium falciparum are the main confirmatory means for malaria
diagnosis in most health facilities without microscopy services. As a consequence
of this P. falciparum species diagnostic approach, non-falciparum malaria is not 
only under-diagnosed but entirely missed, thereby making the exact disease burden
unknown. We thus investigated the prevalence of various Plasmodium spp. and
associated burden of infection in selected communities in Zambia.
METHODS: Data from two malaria hyper-endemic provinces (Eastern and Luapula) of
the 2012 National Malaria Indicator Survey (MIS), conducted between April and May
2012, were used. The MIS is a nationally representative, two-stage cluster survey
conducted to coincide with the end of the malaria transmission season. Social,
behavioural and background information were collected from households as part of 
the survey. Thick blood smears, RDTs and dried blood spots (DBS) were collected
from children below six years of age. Slides were stained using Giemsa and
examined by microscopy while polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to analyse 
the DBS for malaria Plasmodium spp. Multivariate logistic regression was employed
to examine the association between background factors and malaria.
RESULTS: Overall, 873 children younger than six years of age were surveyed. The
overall prevalence of Plasmodium spp. by PCR was 54.3% (95% CI 51-57.6%). Of the 
total Plasmodium isolates, 88% were P. falciparum, 10.6% were mixed infections
and 1.4% were non-falciparum mono infections. Among the mixed infections, the
majority were a combination of P. falciparum and P. malariae (6.5% of all mixed
infections). Children two years and older (2-5 years) had three-fold higher risk 
of mixed malaria infections (aOR 2.8 CI 1.31-5.69) than children younger than two
years of age.
CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of mixed Plasmodium spp. infections in this
population stresses review of the current malaria RDT diagnostic approaches. The 
observed less incidence of mixed infections in children under two years of age
compared to their older two-to-five-year-old counterparts is probably due to the 
protective maternal passive immunity, among other factors, in that age group.

BACKGROUND: Neonatal near miss cases occur more often than neonatal deaths and
could enable a more comprehensive analysis of risk factors, short-term outcomes
and prognostic factors in neonates born to mothers with severe obstetric
complications. The objective was to assess the incidence, presentation and
perinatal outcomes of severe obstetric morbidity in two referral hospitals in
Central Uganda.
METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted between March 1, 2013 and
February 28, 2014, in which all newborns from cases of severe pregnancy and
childbirth complications were eligible for inclusion. The obstetric conditions
included obstetric haemorrhage, hypertensive disorders, obstructed labour,
chorioamnionitis and pregnancy-specific complications such as malaria, anemia and
premature rupture of membranes. Still births, neonatal deaths and neonatal near
miss cases (defined using criteria that employed clinical features, presence of
organ-system dysfunction and management provided to the newborns were compiled). 
Stratified and multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to
identify risk factors for perinatal death.
RESULTS: Of the 3100 mothers, 192 (6.2%) had abortion complications. Of the
remainder, there were 2142 (73.1%) deliveries, from whom the fetal outcomes were 
257 (12.0%) still births, 369 (17.2%) neonatal deaths, 786 (36.7%) neonatal near 
misses and 730 (34.1%) were newborns with no or minimal life threatening
complications. Of the 235 babies admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit
(NICU), the main reasons for admission were prematurity for 64 (26.8%), birth
asphyxia for 59 (23.7%), and grunting respiration for 26 (11.1%). Of the 235
babies, 38 (16.2%) died in the neonatal period, and of these, 16 died in the
first 24 hours after admission. Ruptured uterus caused the highest case-specific 
mortality of 76.8%, and led to 16.9% of all newborn deaths. Across the four
groups, there were significant differences in mean birth weight, p = 0.003.
CONCLUSIONS: Antepartum hemorrhage, ruptured uterus, severe preeclampsia,
eclampsia, and the syndrome of Hemolysis, Elevated Liver Enzymes, Low Platelets
(HELLP syndrome), led to statistically significant attributable risk of newborn
deaths (still birth or neonatal deaths). Development of severe maternal outcomes,
the mothers having been referred, and gravidity of 5 or more were significantly
associated with newborn deaths.

Care Institute, 133 Brookline Avenue, 6th Floor, Boston, MA 02215 USA.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the determinants of compliance with national policies
recommending Artemisinin Combination Therapy (ACT) for the treatment of
uncomplicated malaria in the community.
METHODS: We used data from Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, and Uganda national
household surveys that were conducted with a standardized World Health
Organization (WHO) methodology to measure access to and use of medicines. We
analyzed all episodes of acute fever reported in the five surveys. We used
logistic regression models accounting for the clustered design of the surveys to 
identify determinants of seeking care in public healthcare facilities, of being
treated with antimalarials, and of receiving ACT.
RESULTS: Overall, 92% of individuals with a febrile episode sought care outside
the home, 96% received medicines, 67% were treated with antimalarials, and 16%
received ACT. The choice of provider was influenced by perceptions about
medicines availability and affordability. In addition, seeking care in a public
healthcare facility was the single most important predictor of treatment with ACT
[odds ratio (OR): 4.64, 95% confidence intervals (CI): 2.98-7.22, P < 0.001].
Children under 5 years old were more likely than adults to be treated with
antimalarials [OR: 1.28, CI: 0.91-1.79, not significant (NS)] but less likely to 
receive ACT (OR: 0.80, CI: 0.57-1.13, NS).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm the high prevalence of presumptive antimalarial 
treatment for acute fever, especially in public healthcare facilities where poor 
people seek care. They show that perceptions about access to medicines shape
behaviors by directing patients and caregivers to sources of care where they
believe medicines are accessible. The success of national policies recommending
ACT for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria depends not only on restricting
ACT to confirmed malaria cases, but also on ensuring that ACT is available and
affordable for those who need it.

Severity of malaria in relation to a complement receptor 1 polymorphism: a
case-control study.

Tettey R, Ayeh-Kumi P, Tettey P, Adjei GO, Asmah RH, Dodoo D.

BACKGROUND: Studies on the relationship between complement receptor 1 (CR1)
polymorphisms in exon 29 encoding the Knops blood group antigens (Swain-Langley
(Sl) and McCoy (McC)) and outcome of clinical malaria have produced inconsistent 
results.
METHODS: Blood samples from Ghanaian children (n = 150) aged 1-12 years with
complicated and uncomplicated malaria were genotyped for the Sl and McC blood
group alleles by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length
polymorphism. Effect of Sl and McC genotypes on the clinical outcome of malaria
was evaluated using logistic regression.
RESULTS: McCa/b genotype was significantly associated with more than two-fold
increased susceptibility for severe malaria (OR = 2.31; 95% CI: 1.03-5.20, P =
0.043). However, McCb/b was associated with an 88% reduced risk of severe malaria
(OR = 0.12; 95% CI: 0.02-0.64, P = 0.013). In contrast, there was no significant 
association between severe malaria and Sl1/1, Sl1/2, Sl2/and McCa/a genotypes.
There was a trend towards decreased susceptibility to both cerebral malaria (CM) 
(OR = 0.13; 95% CI: 0.02-1.15, P = 0.07) and severe malarial anaemia (SA) (OR =
0.14; 95% CI: 0.02-1.19, P = 0.07) for McCb/b genotype when compared with the
McCa/a genotype. There were no significant associations between Sl1/2 or Sl2/2
genotype and CM or SA when compared with Sl1/1 genotype.
CONCLUSIONS: McCa/b was associated with increased susceptibility to severe
malaria and McCb/b associated with reduced risk of severe malaria. Further
studies with large sample size in other malaria endemic regions in Africa are
warranted to confirm these findings.

BACKGROUND: Peru has presented a decreasing malaria trend during the last decade,
particularly in areas on northwestern coast; however, a limited number of cases
continues to be reported yearly mainly in malaria hotspots.
METHODS: A two-phase study was conducted to identify spatial and temporal
clusters of incident Plasmodium vivax malaria, as well as to determine risk
factors associated with households (HH) presenting P. vivax malaria episodes in
an urban area of the northwestern Peruvian Coast from June 2008 to May 2010. In
the first stage, a full census of the study population was conducted, including
geo-referencing of reported P. vivax episodes. In the second stage, a
population-based case-control study allowed the identification of risk factors
associated with HHs reporting episodes. A total of 117 case HHs with reported P. 
vivax and 117 control HHs without malaria episodes were assessed. A
semi-structured questionnaire was used to interview the head of households and to
collect data on HH location and structure, availability of public services,
preventive malaria measures, family member with outdoor occupation (farmer,
moto-taxi driver), and other HH characteristics. Univariate and multivariate
logistic regression analyses were performed to determine case-HH risk factors.
SaTScan was used to detect spatial and temporal P. vivax malaria clusters.
RESULTS: The most likely spatial cluster of malaria incidence included 1,040
people (22.4% of total population) in 245 HHs (24.6% of total HHs) accounting for
283 malaria episodes (40.1% of total episodes) during the study period (RR = 2.3,
p < 0.001). A temporal cluster was also identified from April 12, 2009 to July 4,
2009 accounting for 355 malaria episodes (50.4% of total episodes) (RR = 7.2,
p = 0.001). Factors significantly associated with case HHs compared with control 
HHs were: proximity to water drain < 200 metres (OR = 2.3, 95% CI: 1.3, 4.0); HH 
size >5 individuals (OR = 1.8, 95% CI: 1.0, 3.2); lack of potable water
(OR = 1.8, 95% CI: 1.1, 3.2); and having domestic and peridomestic animals
(OR = 3.6, 95% CI: 1.3, 9.5).
CONCLUSION: Plasmodium vivax malaria incidence is highly heterogeneous in space
and time in the urban study area with important geographical and housing risk
factors associated with symptomatic episodes.

BACKGROUND: This study examines the relative importance of living in an urban
versus rural setting and malaria in contributing to the public health problem of 
malarial anaemia (MA) and anaemia respectively in apparently healthy primary
school children.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 727 school children aged
between four and 15 years living in an urban (302) and rural (425) settings in
the Mount Cameroon area. Blood sample collected from each child was used for the 
preparation of blood films for detection of malaria parasites and assessment of
malaria parasite density as well as full blood count determination using an
automated haematology analyzer. Based on haemoglobin (Hb) measurements, children 
with malaria parasitaemia were stratified into MA (Hb<11 g/dL); mild MA (Hb of
8-10.9 g/dL); moderate MA (Hb of 6.1-7.9 g/dL) and severe MA (Hb≤6 g/dL).
Evaluation of potential determinants of MA and anaemia was performed by
multinomial logistic-regression analysis and odds ratios used to evaluate risk
factors.
RESULTS: Out of the 727 children examined, 72 (9.9%) had MA. The prevalence of MA
and anaemia were significantly higher (χ2 = 36.5, P <0.001; χ2 = 16.19, P <0.001 
respectively) in children in the urban (17.9%; 26.8% respectively) than in the
rural area (4.2%; 14.8% respectively). Majority of the MA cases were mild
(88.9%), with moderate (5.6%) and severe MA (5.6%) occurring in the urban area
only. The age group ≤6 years was significantly (P <0.05) associated with both MA 
and anaemia. In addition, low parasite density was associated with MA while
malaria parasite negative and microcytosis were associated with anaemia.
CONCLUSIONS: Malarial anaemia and anaemia display heterogeneity and complexity
that differ with the type of settlement. The presence of severe MA and the
contributions of the age group ≤6 years, low parasite density and microcytosis to
the public health problem of MA and anaemia are noteworthy.

BACKGROUND: In 2010, the World Health Organization shifted its malaria guidelines
from recommending the empiric treatment of all febrile children to treating only 
those with laboratory-confirmed malaria. This study evaluated the frequency and
predictors of malaria over-treatment among febrile malaria-negative children in
Kenya.
METHODS: Between 2012 and 2013, 1,362 children presenting consecutively with
temperature ≥37.5°C to Kisii and Homa Bay hospitals were enrolled in a
cross-sectional study evaluating causes of fever. Children were screened for
malaria using smear microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests and managed according
to standard of care at the hospitals. The frequency of anti-malarial
prescriptions among children with laboratory-confirmed malaria negative children 
(malaria over-treatment) was determined; and clinical and demographic correlates 
of overtreatment evaluated using logistic regression. Because of differences in
malaria endemicity, analyses were stratified and compared by site.
RESULTS: Among 1,362 children enrolled, 46 (7%) of 685 children in Kisii, and 310
(45.8%) of 677 in Homa Bay had laboratory-confirmed malaria; p < 0.001. Among
malaria-negative children; 210 (57.2%) in Homa Bay and 45 (7.0%) in Kisii
received anti-malarials; p < 0.001. Predictors of over-treatment in Homa Bay
included ≥ one integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI) danger sign
(aOR = 8.47; 95% CI: 4.81-14.89), fever lasting ≥ seven days (aOR = 4.94; 95% CI:
1.90-12.86), and fever ≥39°C (aOR = 3.07; 95% CI: 1.58-5.96). In Kisii, only
fever ≥39°C predicted over-treatment (aOR = 2.13; 95% CI: 1.02-4.45).
CONCLUSIONS: Malaria over-treatment was common, particularly in Homa Bay, where
the prevalence of malaria was extremely high. Severe illness and high or
prolonged fever were associated with overtreatment. Overtreatment may result in
failure to treat other serious causes of fever, drug resistance, and
unnecessarily treatment costs.

BACKGROUND: Artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) is first-line treatment for
malaria in most endemic countries and is increasingly available in the private
sector. Most studies on ACT adherence have been conducted in the public sector,
with minimal data from private retailers.
METHODS: Parallel studies were conducted in Tanzania, in which patients obtaining
artemether-lumefantrine (AL) at 40 randomly selected public health facilities and
37 accredited drug dispensing outlets (ADDOs) were visited at home and questioned
about doses taken. The effect of sector on adherence, controlling for potential
confounders was assessed using logistic regression with a random effect for
outlet.
RESULTS: Of 572 health facility patients and 450 ADDO patients, 74.5% (95% CI:
69.8, 78.8) and 69.8% (95% CI: 64.6, 74.5), respectively, completed treatment and
46.0% (95% CI: 40.9, 51.2) and 34.8% (95% CI: 30.1, 39.8) took each dose at the
correct time ('timely completion'). ADDO patients were wealthier, more educated, 
older, sought care later in the day, and were less likely to test positive for
malaria than health facility patients. Controlling for patient characteristics,
the adjusted odds of completed treatment and of timely completion for ADDO
patients were 0.65 (95% CI: 0.43, 1.00) and 0.69 (95% CI: 0.47, 1.01) times that 
of health facility patients. Higher socio-economic status was associated with
both adherence measures. Higher education was associated with completed treatment
(adjusted OR = 1.68, 95% CI: 1.20, 2.36); obtaining AL in the evening was
associated with timely completion (adjusted OR = 0.35, 95% CI: 0.19, 0.64).
Factors associated with adherence in each sector were examined separately. In
both sectors, recalling correct instructions was positively associated with both 
adherence measures. In health facility patients, but not ADDO patients, taking
the first dose of AL at the outlet was associated with timely completion
(adjusted OR = 2.11, 95% CI: 1.46, 3.04).
CONCLUSION: When controlling for patient characteristics, there was some evidence
that the adjusted odds of adherence for ADDO patients was lower than that for
public health facility patients. Better understanding is needed of which patient 
care aspects are most important for adherence, including the role of effective
provision of advice.

BACKGROUND: Malaria is holo-endemic in Burkina Faso and causes approximately
40,000 deaths every year. In 2010, health authorities scaled up community case
management of malaria with artemisinin-based combination therapy. Previous trials
and pilot project evaluations have shown that this strategy may be feasible,
acceptable, and effective under controlled implementation conditions. However,
little is known about its effectiveness or feasibility/acceptability under
real-world conditions of implementation at national scale.
METHODS: A panel study was conducted in two health districts of Burkina Faso,
Kaya and Zorgho. Three rounds of surveys were conducted during the peak
malaria-transmission season (in August 2011, 2012 and 2013) in a panel of 2,232
randomly selected households. All sickness episodes in children under five and
associated health-seeking practices were documented. Community health worker
(CHW) treatment coverage was evaluated and the determinants of consulting a CHW
were analysed using multi-level logistic regression.
RESULTS: In urban areas, less than 1% of sick children consulted a CHW, compared 
to 1%-9% in rural areas. Gaps remained between intentions and actual practices in
treatment-seeking behaviour. In 2013, the most frequent reasons for not
consulting the CHW were: the fact of not knowing him/her (78% in urban areas; 33%
in rural areas); preferring the health centre (23% and 45%, respectively); and
drug stock-outs (2% and 12%, respectively). The odds of visiting a CHW in rural
areas significantly increased with the distance to the nearest health centre and 
if the household had been visited by a CHW during the previous three months.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that CHWs are rarely used in Burkina Faso to treat 
malaria in children. Issues of implementation fidelity, a lack of adaptation to
the local context and problems of acceptability/feasibility might have undermined
the effectiveness of community case management of malaria. While some suggest
extending this strategy in urban areas, total absence of CHW services uptake in
these areas suggest that caution is required. Even in rural areas, treatment
coverage by CHWs was considerably less than that reported by previous trials and 
pilot projects. This study confirms the necessity of evaluating public health
interventions under real-world conditions of implementation.

BACKGROUND: Until 2009, the Laverania subgenus counted only two representatives: 
Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium reichenowi. The recent development of
non-invasive methods allowed re-exploration of plasmodial diversity in African
apes. Although a large number of great ape populations have now been studied
regarding Plasmodium infections in Africa, there are still vast areas of their
distribution that remained unexplored. Gabon constitutes an important part of the
range of western central African great ape subspecies (Pan troglodytes
troglodytes and Gorilla gorilla gorilla), but has not been studied so far. In the
present study, the diversity of Plasmodium species circulating in great apes in
Gabon was analysed.
METHODS: The analysis of 1,261 faecal samples from 791 chimpanzees and 470
gorillas collected from 24 sites all over Gabon was performed. Plasmodium
infections were characterized by amplification and sequencing of a portion of the
Plasmodium cytochrome b gene.
RESULTS: The analysis of the 1,261 samples revealed that at least six Plasmodium 
species circulate in great apes in Gabon (Plasmodium praefalciparum, Plasmodium
gorA (syn Plasmodium adleri), Plasmodium gorB (syn Plasmodium blacklocki) in
gorillas and Plasmodium gaboni, P. reichenowi and Plasmodium billcollinsi in
chimpanzees). No new phylogenetic lineages were discovered. The average infection
rate was 21.3% for gorillas and 15.4% for chimpanzees. A logistic regression
showed that the probability of infection was significantly dependent on the
freshness of the droppings but not of the host species or of the average
pluviometry of the months of collection.

BACKGROUND: There is little data regarding the effect of ramping up new screening
interventions on their uptake by target populations into routine care services in
developing countries. This study aimed to determine patient-level factors
associated with failure of pregnant women to get screened for syphilis during
antenatal care, in the context of a national rollout of rapid syphilis point of
care tests (POCTs) in Ghana.
METHODS: An unmatched 1:2 case control study conducted among women admitted for
delivery in two district hospitals in the Ashanti Region of Ghana from August to 
October 2010, 7 to 9 months after the introduction of POCTs in the region. Cases 
were women who had not been screened for syphilis during antenatal care and
controls were women who had been screened. Patient-reported factors for being
unscreened were examined using logistic regression to obtain odds ratios (ORs)
and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
RESULTS: 160 consecutive unscreened and 327 screened women were recruited. Most
women had good knowledge of syphilis (58.7% among unscreened women vs. 64.2%
among screened; P=0.24). Factors associated with failure to get screened were:
attending antenatal care in a private health facility (adjusted OR, 11.09; 95% CI
5.48-22.48), previous adverse pregnancy outcome (adjusted OR, 1.98; 95% CI
1.22-3.23) and not being screened for HIV during the current pregnancy (adjusted 
OR, 2.78; 95% CI 1.50-5.13). The odds of being unscreened also increased with
decreasing doses of intermittent preventive treatment for malaria in pregnancy
received (P trend<0.001) and decreasing education level (P trend=0.02).
CONCLUSION: Significant risk factors for not being screened, following the
national rollout of syphilis POCTs, related to the type of health facility where 
antenatal care was received and some of the women's personal characteristics.
Targeting of private medical facilities to include syphilis POCTs and support
other neglected public health interventions should be a priority.

BACKGROUND: After successfully reducing the malaria burden to pre-elimination
levels over the past two decades, the national malaria programme in Vietnam has
recently switched from control to elimination. However, in forested areas of
Central Vietnam malaria elimination is likely to be jeopardized by the high
occurrence of asymptomatic and submicroscopic infections as shown by previous
reports. This paper presents the results of a malaria survey carried out in a
remote forested area of Central Vietnam where we evaluated malaria prevalence and
risk factors for infection.
METHODS: After a full census (four study villages = 1,810 inhabitants), the study
population was screened for malaria infections by standard microscopy and, if
needed, treated according to national guidelines. An additional blood sample on
filter paper was also taken in a random sample of the population for later
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and more accurate estimation of the actual burden
of malaria infections. The risk factor analysis for malaria infections was done
using survey multivariate logistic regression as well as the classification and
regression tree method (CART).
RESULTS: A total of 1,450 individuals were screened. Malaria prevalence by
microscopy was 7.8% (ranging from 3.9 to 10.9% across villages) mostly Plasmodium
falciparum (81.4%) or Plasmodium vivax (17.7%) mono-infections; a large majority 
(69.9%) was asymptomatic. By PCR, the prevalence was estimated at 22.6% (ranging 
from 16.4 to 42.5%) with a higher proportion of P. vivax mono-infections (43.2%).
The proportion of sub-patent infections increased with increasing age and with
decreasing prevalence across villages. The main risk factors were young age,
village, house structure, and absence of bed net.
CONCLUSION: This study confirmed that in Central Vietnam a substantial part of
the human malaria reservoir is hidden. Additional studies are urgently needed to 
assess the contribution of this hidden reservoir to the maintenance of malaria
transmission. Such evidence will be crucial for guiding elimination strategies.

BACKGROUND: In 2010, the National Malaria Control Programme with the support of
Roll Back Malaria partners implemented a nationally representative Malaria
Indicator Survey (MIS), which assembled malaria burden and control intervention
related data. The MIS data were analysed to produce a contemporary smooth map of 
malaria risk and evaluate the control interventions effects on parasitaemia risk 
after controlling for environmental/climatic, demographic and socioeconomic
characteristics.
METHODS: A Bayesian geostatistical logistic regression model was fitted on the
observed parasitological prevalence data. Important environmental/climatic risk
factors of parasitaemia were identified by applying Bayesian variable selection
within geostatistical model. The best model was employed to predict the disease
risk over a grid of 4 km(2) resolution. Validation was carried out to assess
model predictive performance. Various measures of control intervention coverage
were derived to estimate the effects of interventions on parasitaemia risk after 
adjusting for environmental, socioeconomic and demographic factors.
RESULTS: Normalized difference vegetation index and rainfall were identified as
important environmental/climatic predictors of malaria risk. The population
adjusted risk estimates ranges from 6.46% in Lagos state to 43.33% in Borno.
Interventions appear to not have important effect on malaria risk. The odds of
parasitaemia appears to be on downward trend with improved socioeconomic status
and living in rural areas increases the odds of testing positive to malaria
parasites. Older children also have elevated risk of malaria infection.
CONCLUSIONS: The produced maps and estimates of parasitaemic children give an
important synoptic view of current parasite prevalence in the country. Control
activities will find it a useful tool in identifying priority areas for
intervention.

OBJECTIVE: We conducted a community survey to estimate the prevalence and
describe the features, risk factors, and consequences of convulsive status
epilepticus (CSE) among people with active convulsive epilepsy (ACE) identified
in a multisite survey in Africa.
METHODS: We obtained clinical histories of CSE and neurologic examination data
among 1,196 people with ACE identified from a population of 379,166 people in 3
sites: Agincourt, South Africa; Iganga-Mayuge, Uganda; and Kilifi, Kenya. We
performed serologic assessment for the presence of antibodies to parasitic
infections and HIV and determined adherence to antiepileptic drugs. Consequences 
of CSE were assessed using a questionnaire. Logistic regression was used to
identify risk factors.
RESULTS: The adjusted prevalence of CSE in ACE among the general population
across the 3 sites was 2.3 per 1,000, and differed with site (p < 0.0001). Over
half (55%) of CSE occurred in febrile illnesses and focal seizures were present
in 61%. Risk factors for CSE in ACE were neurologic impairments, acute
encephalopathy, previous hospitalization, and presence of antibody titers to
falciparum malaria and HIV; these differed across sites. Burns (15%), lack of
education (49%), being single (77%), and unemployment (78%) were common in CSE;
these differed across the 3 sites. Nine percent with and 10% without CSE died.
CONCLUSIONS: CSE is common in people with ACE in Africa; most occurs with febrile
illnesses, is untreated, and has focal features suggesting preventable risk
factors. Effective prevention and the management of infections and neurologic
impairments may reduce the burden of CSE in ACE.

BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization recommends use of multiple approaches
to control malaria. The integrated approach to malaria prevention advocates the
use of several malaria prevention methods in a holistic manner. This study
assessed perceptions and practices on integrated malaria prevention in Wakiso
district, Uganda.
METHODS: A clustered cross-sectional survey was conducted among 727 households
from 29 villages using both quantitative and qualitative methods. Assessment was 
done on awareness of various malaria prevention methods, potential for use of the
methods in a holistic manner, and reasons for dislike of certain methods.
Households were classified as using integrated malaria prevention if they used at
least two methods. Logistic regression was used to test for factors associated
with the use of integrated malaria prevention while adjusting for clustering
within villages.
RESULTS: Participants knew of the various malaria prevention methods in the
integrated approach including use of insecticide treated nets (97.5%), removing
mosquito breeding sites (89.1%), clearing overgrown vegetation near houses
(97.9%), and closing windows and doors early in the evenings (96.4%). If trained,
most participants (68.6%) would use all the suggested malaria prevention methods 
of the integrated approach. Among those who would not use all methods, the main
reasons given were there being too many (70.2%) and cost (32.0%). Only 33.0%
households were using the integrated approach to prevent malaria. Use of
integrated malaria prevention by households was associated with reading
newspapers (AOR 0.34; 95% CI 0.22 -0.53) and ownership of a motorcycle/car (AOR
1.75; 95% CI 1.03 - 2.98).
CONCLUSION: Although knowledge of malaria prevention methods was high and
perceptions on the integrated approach promising, practices on integrated malaria
prevention was relatively low. The use of the integrated approach can be improved
by promoting use of multiple malaria prevention methods through various
communication channels such as mass media.

Reducing the human reservoir of malaria parasites is critical for elimination. We
conducted a community randomized controlled trial in Southern Province, Zambia to
assess the impact of three rounds of a mass test and treatment (MTAT)
intervention on malaria prevalence and health facility outpatient case incidence 
using random effects logistic regression and negative binomial regression,
respectively. Following the intervention, children in the intervention group had 
lower odds of a malaria infection than individuals in the control group (adjusted
odds ratio = 0.47, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.24-0.90). Malaria outpatient 
case incidence decreased 17% in the intervention group relative to the control
group (incidence rate ratio = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.68-1.01). Although a single year
of MTAT reduced malaria prevalence and incidence, the impact of the intervention 
was insufficient to reduce transmission to a level approaching elimination where 
a strategy of aggressive case investigations could be used. Mass drug
administration, more sensitive diagnostics, and gametocidal drugs may potentially
improve interventions targeting the human reservoir of malaria parasites.

Decreased bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO) is a major contributor to the
pathophysiology of severe falciparum malaria. Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is an
enzyme cofactor required for NO synthesis from L-arginine. We hypothesized that
systemic levels of BH₄ would be decreased in children with cerebral malaria,
contributing to low NO bioavailability. In an observational study in Tanzania, we
measured urine levels of biopterin in its various redox states (fully reduced
[BH₄] and the oxidized metabolites, dihydrobiopterin [BH₂] and biopterin [B₀]) in
children with uncomplicated malaria (UM, n = 55), cerebral malaria (CM, n = 45), 
non-malaria central nervous system conditions (NMC, n = 48), and in 111 healthy
controls (HC). Median urine BH4 concentration in CM (1.10 [IQR:0.55-2.18]
μmol/mmol creatinine) was significantly lower compared to each of the other three
groups - UM (2.10 [IQR:1.32-3.14];p<0.001), NMC (1.52 [IQR:1.01-2.71];p = 0.002),
and HC (1.60 [IQR:1.15-2.23];p = 0.005). Oxidized biopterins were increased, and 
the BH4:BH2 ratio markedly decreased in CM. In a multivariate logistic regression
model, each Log10-unit decrease in urine BH4 was independently associated with a 
3.85-fold (95% CI:1.89-7.61) increase in odds of CM (p<0.001). Low systemic BH4
levels and increased oxidized biopterins contribute to the low NO bioavailability
observed in CM. Adjunctive therapy to regenerate BH4 may have a role in improving
NO bioavailability and microvascular perfusion in severe falciparum malaria.

BACKGROUND: In East Africa, epidemics of Rift Valley fever (RVF) occur in cycles 
of 5-15 years following unusually high rainfall. RVF transmission during
inter-epidemic periods (IEP) generally passes undetected in absence of
surveillance in mammalian hosts and vectors. We studied IEP transmission of RVF
and evaluated the demographic, behavioural, occupational and spatial determinants
of past RVF infection.
METHODOLOGY: Between March and August 2012 we collected blood samples, and
administered a risk factor questionnaire among 606 inhabitants of 6 villages in
the seasonally inundated Kilombero Valley, Tanzania. ELISA tests were used to
detect RVFV IgM and IgG antibodies in serum samples. Risk factors were examined
by mixed effects logistic regression.
FINDINGS: RVF virus IgM antibodies, indicating recent RVFV acquisition, were
detected in 16 participants, representing 2.6% overall and in 22.5% of inhibition
ELISA positives (n = 71). Four of 16 (25.0%) IgM positives and 11/71 (15.5%) of
individuals with inhibition ELISA sero-positivity reported they had had no
previous contact with host animals. Sero-positivity on inhibition ELISA was 11.7%
(95% CI 9.2-14.5) and risk was elevated with age (odds ratio (OR) 1.03 per year; 
95% CI 1.01-1.04), among milkers (OR 2.19; 95% CI 1.23-3.91), and individuals
eating raw meat (OR 4.17; 95% CI 1.18-14.66). Households keeping livestock had a 
higher probability of having members with evidence of past infection (OR = 3.04, 
95% CI = 1.42-6.48) than those that do not keep livestock.
CONCLUSION: There is inter-epidemic acquisition of RVFV in Kilombero Valley
inhabitants. In the wake of declining malaria incidence, these findings
underscore the need for clinicians to consider RVF in the differential diagnosis 
for febrile illnesses. Several types of direct contact with livestock are
important risk factors for past infection with RVFV in this study's population.
However, at least part of RVFV transmission appears to have occurred through
bites of infected mosquitoes.

In Sub Sahara Africa, the use of Insecticide Treated Nets (ITNs) is one of many
strategies of Roll Back Malaria (RBM) initiatives to reduce malaria burden. This 
study therefore assessed the current use of insecticide treated nets and the
determinants of its use among the caregivers of under five children in an urban
local government area in Osun state, Nigeria. The study utilised a
cross-sectional design among caregivers of under- five children selected from
households by multistage sampling technique. The study collected quantitative
data using pretested semi structured, interviewer administered questionnaire
while factors that determine the current use of ITN were identified using multi
linear logistic regression. The study revealed that 54.4% caregivers of under
five children were aware of ITNs as one of the malaria preventive measures, 49.1%
had good knowledge of ITN and 38% agreed with the use of ITNs. Thirty four
percent had access to ITNs, 32.3% owned at least one ITN with 30.3% reported been
given free in the health care facilities. Thirty three percent had ever used and 
the foremost reasons for non-use are not readily available and expensive. Only
18.5% currently used ITNs and challenges faced were not easy to treat, difficult 
to set up and no place to keep it. Marital status, knowledge of ITN, attitude
towards ITN, ownership of ITN and free ITN were factors that determined the use
of ITNs amongst the respondents. There is a need to ensure intensive awareness on

BACKGROUND: Outbreaks of vector-borne diseases (VBDs) impose a heavy burden on
vulnerable populations. Despite recent progress in eradication and control,
malaria remains the most prevalent VBD. Integrative approaches that take into
account environmental, socioeconomic, demographic, biological, cultural, and
political factors contributing to malaria risk and vulnerability are needed to
effectively reduce malaria burden. Although the focus on malaria risk has
increasingly gained ground, little emphasis has been given to develop
quantitative methods for assessing malaria risk including malaria vulnerability
in a spatial explicit manner.
METHODS: Building on a conceptual risk and vulnerability framework, we propose a 
spatial explicit approach for modeling relative levels of malaria risk - as a
function of hazard, exposure, and vulnerability - in the United Republic of
Tanzania. A logistic regression model was employed to identify a final set of
risk factors and their contribution to malaria endemicity based on
multidisciplinary geospatial information. We utilized a Geographic Information
System for the construction and visualization of a malaria vulnerability index
and its integration into a spatially explicit malaria risk map.
RESULTS: The spatial pattern of malaria risk was very heterogeneous across the
country. Malaria risk was higher in Mainland areas than in Zanzibar, which is a
result of differences in both malaria entomological inoculation rate and
prevailing vulnerabilities. Areas of high malaria risk were identified in the
southeastern part of the country, as well as in two distinct "hotspots" in the
northwestern part of the country bordering Lake Victoria, while concentrations of
high malaria vulnerability seem to occur in the northwestern, western, and
southeastern parts of the mainland. Results were visualized using both 10×10
km(2) grids and subnational administrative units.
CONCLUSIONS: The presented approach makes an important contribution toward a
decision support tool. By decomposing malaria risk into its components, the
approach offers evidence on which factors could be targeted for reducing malaria 
risk and vulnerability to the disease. Ultimately, results offer relevant
information for place-based intervention planning and more effective spatial
allocation of resources.

BACKGROUND: Malaria remains a significant cause of travel-related mortality and
morbidity. Asians are known to have higher risks because they are less careful in
pre-travel health preparations. This study reports on a cohort of travellers to
malaria-prone regions examined in a previous study, which explored general levels
of pre-travel health preparation.
OBJECTIVES: To describe the preparations taken by travellers at Hong Kong
International Airport going to destinations with significant malaria risks
according to the WHO.
METHOD: A cross-sectional survey was conducted by personal interviews at the
boarding gates of flights in April 2013. The flights were chosen from those to
malaria-prone regions (type I or above) from the 2012 WHO International Travel
and Health Country List.
RESULTS: 403 respondents (75.6% Chinese ethnicity) were travelling to
malaria-prone regions. 95.3% were travelling to developing countries including
China, Thailand, Malaysia and India. 55.1% of respondents had taken at least one 
mosquito prevention measure and 8.9% of respondents had malaria chemoprophylaxis.
Stepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that female gender
(OR=2.21, 95% CI 1.23 to 3.97), residence outside Hong Kong (OR=2.71, 95% CI 1.46
to 5.04) and travel including rural areas (OR=5.67, 95% CI 3.11 to 10.34) were
predictors of optimum pre-travel health preparations.
CONCLUSIONS: Underestimation of malaria risks was a major barrier to adequate
pre-travel health preparations. Targeted health education and information about
risk is necessary to improve levels of travel health preparedness.

Medical Sciences.

The relationship between blood groups and some infections such as norovirus,
cholera, and malaria has been reported. Despite the importance of brucellosis,
there is a lack of data on the relationship between blood groups and brucellosis.
Thus, in this study, we examined the relationship between blood groups and
brucellosis. In this case-control study, the blood groups of 100 patients with
brucellosis and 200 healthy individuals were studied. Exclusion criteria for the 
control group consisted of a positive Coombs Wright test or a history of
brucellosis. The chi-square test was used to compare qualitative variables
between the two groups. The variables that met inclusion criteria for the
regression model were entered into the logistic regression model. A total of 43% 
patients were female and 57% male; 27% were urban and 73% rural. Regression
analysis showed that the likelihood of brucellosis infection was 6.26 times more 
in people with blood group AB than in those with blood group O (P<0.001).
However, Rh type was not associated with brucellosis infection. Thus, there is a 
relationship between blood group and brucellosis. People with blood group AB were
susceptible to brucellosis, but no difference was observed for brucellosis
infection in terms of blood Rh type.

BACKGROUND: The birth weight and gestational age at birth are two important
variables that define neonatal morbidity and mortality. In developed countries,
chronic maternal diseases like hypertension, diabetes mellitus, renal disease or 
collagen vascular disease is the most common cause of intrauterine growth
restriction (IUGR). Maternal nutrition, pregnancy induced hypertension, chronic
maternal infections, and other infections such as cytomegalovirus, parvovirus,
rubella and malaria are the other causes of IUGR. The present study examines the 
secular trend of Small for Gestational Age (SGA) over 15 years and risk factors
for SGA from a referral hospital in India.
METHODS: Data from 1996 to 2010 was obtained from the labour room register. A
rotational sampling scheme was used i.e. 12 months of the year were divided into 
4 quarters. Taking into consideration all deliveries that met the inclusion
criteria, babies whose birth weights were less than 10(th) percentile of the cut 
off values specific for gestational ages, were categorized as SGA. Only
deliveries of live births that occurred between 22 and 42 weeks of pregnancy were
considered in this study. Besides bivariate analyses, multivariable logistic
regression analysis was done. Nagelkerke R(2) statistics and Hosmer and Lemeshow 
chi-square statistics were used as goodness of fit statistics.
RESULTS: Based on the data from 36,674 deliveries, the incidence of SGA was 11.4%
in 1996 and 8.4% in 2010. Women who had multiple pregnancies had the higher odds 
of having SGA babies, 2.8 (2.3-3.3) times. The women with hypertensive disease
had 1.8 (1.5-1.9) times higher odds of having SGA. Underweight women had 1.7 (1.3
- 2.1) times and anaemic mothers had 1.29 (1.01 - 1.6) times higher odds. The
mothers who had cardiac disease were 1.4 (1.01 - 2.0) times at higher odds for
SGA. In teenage pregnancies, the odds of SGA was 1.3 (1.1 - 1.5) times higher
than mothers in the age group 20 to 35 years.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a significant reduction in the incidence of SGA by 26% over
15 years. The women with the above modifiable risk factors need to be identified 
early and provided with health education on optimal birth weight.

BACKGROUND: Based on routine health facility case data, Rwanda has achieved a
significant malaria burden reduction in the past ten years. However,
community-based malaria parasitaemia burden and reasons for continued residual
infections, despite a high coverage of control interventions, have yet to be
characterized. Measurement of malaria parasitaemia rates and evaluation of
associated risk factors among asymptomatic household members in a rural community
in Rwanda were conducted.
METHODS: A malariometric household survey was conducted between June and November
2013, involving 12,965 persons living in 3,989 households located in 35 villages 
in a sector in eastern Rwanda. Screening for malaria parasite carriage and
collection of demographic, socio-economic, house structural features, and prior
fever management data, were performed. Logistic regression models with adjustment
for within- and between-households clustering were used to assess malaria
parasitaemia risk determinants.
RESULTS: Overall, malaria parasitaemia was found in 652 (5%) individuals, with
518 (13%) of households having at least one parasitaemic member. High malaria
parasite carriage risk was associated with being male, child or adolescent (age
group 4-15), reported history of fever and living in a household with multiple
occupants. A malaria parasite carriage risk-protective effect was associated with
living in households of, higher socio-economic status, where the head of
household was educated and where the house floor or walls were made of
cement/bricks rather than mud/earth/wood materials. Parasitaemia cases were found
to significantly cluster in the Gikundamvura area that neighbours marshlands.
CONCLUSION: Overall, Ruhuha Sector can be classified as hypo-endemic, albeit with
a particular 'cell of villages' posing a higher risk for malaria parasitaemia
than others. Efforts to further reduce transmission and eventually eliminate
malaria locally should focus on investments in programmes that improve house
structure features (that limit indoor malaria transmission), making
insecticide-treated bed nets and indoor residual spraying implementation more
effective.

BACKGROUND: Identification of risk factors is important for the establishment of 
malaria elimination programmes tailored to specific regions. Type of house
construction had been associated with increasing risk of acquiring malaria. This 
study aimed at establishing the association between determinants of low
socio-economic status (SES) and type of house construction with the likelihood of
living in a Plasmodium vivax malarious corregimiento (smallest political
division) in Panama during 2009-2012.
METHODS: To determine the association between type-2 houses (build with deciduous
materials) and other determinants of low SES, with living in a malarious
corregimiento, this study analyzed demographic and housing census data (2010),
and malaria incidence aggregated at the corregimiento level (2009-2012), using a 
Spearman's non-parametric correlation test to explore for associations, followed 
by a case-control study and a reduced multivariate logistic regression approach
for confirmation.
RESULTS: A descriptive temporal and spatial analysis indicated that P. vivax in
Panama was associated with Amerindian reservations. Moreover, this study
demonstrated that a strong correlation (deleterious effect) existed between
living in a malarious corregimiento and being exposed to a type-2 house (OR
= > 1.0) (p < 0.001), while, it showed an inverse correlation for exposure to
type-1 houses (protective effect) (build with permanent materials) (OR = < 1.0)
(p < 0.001). In the same way, a significant association between exposure to
type-2 houses and the outcome of living in a malarious corregimiento was found
using a case-control study approach (Chi(2) test = p < 0.001), that was confirmed
applying a reduced multivariate logistic regression fitted model.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that living in a P. vivax malarious
corregimiento in Panama during 2009-2012 was strongly correlated with those
corregimientos having a high proportion of type-2 houses. A multivariate logistic
regression approach at the house and corregimiento level indicated a strong
association of type-2 houses, dirt floors and illiteracy with the likelihood of
living in a malarious corregimiento. It is expected that these findings will help
implement a multi-sectorial approach for the elimination of malaria in poor areas
of Panama where malaria is endemic, which emphasizes house improvements such as
mosquito-proofing and socio-economic development.

BACKGROUND: Malaria is a major health problem in Thailand, especially in areas
adjacent to the borders of Myanmar. Delay in seeking treatment is an important
factor in the development of severe complications, death and the transmission of 
the disease. This study aimed to investigate factors affecting delays in seeking 
treatment of malaria patients.
METHODS: A cross-sectional analytic study was conducted in 456 malaria patients
along the Thailand-Myanmar border. Patients were selected by stratified sampling 
from 11 malaria clinics and five public hospitals in Tak Province, Thailand. Data
were collected by the use of a structured interview questionnaire and from
patient's medical records.
RESULTS: The majority of patients were categorized with an ethnicity of 'hill
tribe' (65.8%), followed by Thai (34.2%). Seventy-nine per cent of patients
delayed seeking treatment. A simple logistic regression identified significant
factors affecting delays in seeking treatment: people of "hill tribe" ethnicity; 
plasmodium species; self-treatment; visiting sub-district health promotion
hospital/malaria post before visiting a malaria clinic or public hospital; and
low to medium social support. After being subjected to multivariate analysis,
factors significantly associated with the delay were "hill tribe" ethnicity
(ORadj = 2.32, 95% CI: 1.34-4.04); infection with P.vivax (ORadj=2.02, 95% CI:
1.19-3.41; self-treatment (ORadj = 1.73, 95% CI: 1.04-2.85); and receiving a low 
degree of social support (ORadj = 2.58, 95% CI: 1.24-5.35).
CONCLUSIONS: Emphasis should be placed on need for early diagnosis and treatment 
in malaria patients as well as on ensuring the first facility for detection and
treatment of malaria is a malaria clinic or public hospital, and the promotion of
social support. These are especially important issues for the health of hill
tribe people.

Caregivers' treatment-seeking behaviour for children under age five in
malaria-endemic areas of rural Myanmar: a cross-sectional study.

BACKGROUND: A community-based malaria intervention was introduced through fixed
and mobile clinics in rural Myanmar. This study attempted to identify
treatment-seeking behaviour of caregivers for children under five and the
determinants of appropriate treatment-seeking behaviour in mobile clinic villages
(MV) and non-mobile clinic villages (NMV) in malaria-endemic rural areas in
Myanmar.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 23 MV and 25 NMV in Ingapu
Township, Myanmar. Appropriate treatment-seeking behaviour was operationally
defined as seeking treatment from trained personnel or at a health facility
within 24 hours after the onset of fever. Multiple logistic regression analyses
were conducted to identify the determinants of appropriate treatment-seeking
behaviour.
RESULTS: Among the 597 participants in both types of villages, 166 (35.3%)
caregivers sought appropriate treatment. No significant difference in appropriate
treatment-seeking behaviour was found between the two types of villages (adjusted
odds ratio (AOR), 0.80; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.51-1.24). Determinants of
behaviour include proximity to public health facilities (AOR, 5.86; 95% CI,
3.43-10.02), knowledge of malaria (AOR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.14-3.17), malaria
prevention behaviour (AOR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.13-2.76), treatment at home (AOR,
0.26; 95% CI, 0.15-0.45), and treatment and transportation costs (AOR, 0.52; 95% 
CI, 0.33-0.83).
CONCLUSIONS: Caregivers' treatment-seeking behaviour was poor for fever cases
among children under age five, and did not differ significantly between MV and
NMV. It is necessary to educate caregivers, particularly for early treatment
seeking and appropriate use of health care options for fever, and catering to
their medical needs. These findings can help promote awareness and prevention,
and improve the quality of interventions at the community level.

BACKGROUND: A prospective study on severe and complicated malaria was undertaken 
in the tribal dominated area of Bastar division, Chhattisgarh (CG), Central
India, with an objective to understand the clinical epidemiology of complicated
malaria in patients attending at a referral hospital.
METHODS: Blood smears, collected from the general medicine and pediatric wards of
a government tertiary health care facility located in Jagdalpur, CG, were
microscopically examined for malaria parasite from July 2010 to December 2013.
The Plasmodium falciparum positive malaria cases who met enrollment criteria and 
provided written informed consent were enrolled under different malaria
categories following WHO guidelines. PCR was performed to reconfirm the presence 
of P.falciparum mono infection among enrolled cases. Univariate and multivariate 
logistic regression analysis was done to identify different risk factors using
STATA 11.0.
RESULTS: A total of 40,924 cases were screened for malaria. The prevalence of
malaria and P.falciparum associated complicated malaria (severe and cerebral
both) in the hospital was 6% and 0.81%, respectively. P.falciparum malaria
prevalence, severity and associated mortality in this region peaked at the age of
> 4-5 years and declined with increasing age. P.falciparum malaria was
significantly more prevalent in children than adults (P < 0.00001). Among adults,
males had significantly more P.falciparum malaria than females (P < 0.00001).
Case fatality rate due to cerebral malaria and severe malaria was, respectively, 
32% and 9% among PCR confirmed mono P.falciparum cases. Coma was the only
independent predictor of mortality in multivariate regression analysis. Mortality
was significantly associated with multi-organ complication score (P = 0.0003).
CONCLUSION: This study has revealed that the pattern of morbidity and mortality
in this part of India is very different from earlier reported studies from India.
We find that the peak morbidity and mortality in younger children regardless of
seasonality. This suggests that this age group needs special care for control and
clinical management.

BACKGROUND: BCG is used widely as the sole licensed vaccine against tuberculosis,
but it has variable efficacy and the reasons for this are still unclear. No
reliable biomarkers to predict future protection against, or acquisition of, TB
infection following immunisation have been identified. Lessons from BCG could be 
valuable in the development of effective tuberculosis vaccines.
OBJECTIVES: Within the Entebbe Mother and Baby Study birth cohort in Uganda,
infants received BCG at birth. We investigated factors associated with latent
tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and with cytokine response to mycobacterial antigen
at age five years. We also investigated whether cytokine responses at one year
were associated with LTBI at five years of age.
METHODS: Blood samples from age one and five years were stimulated using crude
culture filtrates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in a six-day whole blood assay.
IFN-γ, IL-5, IL-13 and IL-10 production was measured. LTBI at five years was
determined using T-SPOT.TB(®) assay. Associations with LTBI at five years were
assessed using multivariable logistic regression. Multiple linear regression with
bootstrapping was used to determine factors associated with cytokine responses at
age five years.
RESULTS: LTBI prevalence was 9% at age five years. Only urban residence and
history of TB contact/disease were positively associated with LTBI. BCG vaccine
strain, LTBI, HIV infection, asymptomatic malaria, growth z-scores, childhood
anthelminthic treatment and maternal BCG scar were associated with cytokine
responses at age five. Cytokine responses at one year were not associated with
acquisition of LTBI by five years of age.
CONCLUSION: Although multiple factors influenced anti-myocbacterial immune
responses at age five, factors likely to be associated with exposure to
infectious cases (history of household contact, and urban residence) dominated
the risk of LTBI.

Automated system for characterization and classification of malaria-infected
stages using light microscopic images of thin blood smears.

Das DK(1), Maiti AK, Chakraborty C.

Author information: 
(1)School of Medical Science and Technology, Indian Institute of Technology,
Kharagpur, India.

In this paper, we propose a comprehensive image characterization cum
classification framework for malaria-infected stage detection using microscopic
images of thin blood smears. The methodology mainly includes microscopic imaging 
of Leishman stained blood slides, noise reduction and illumination correction,
erythrocyte segmentation, feature selection followed by machine classification.
Amongst three-image segmentation algorithms (namely, rule-based, Chan-Vese-based 
and marker-controlled watershed methods), marker-controlled watershed technique
provides better boundary detection of erythrocytes specially in overlapping
situations. Microscopic features at intensity, texture and morphology levels are 
extracted to discriminate infected and noninfected erythrocytes. In order to
achieve subgroup of potential features, feature selection techniques, namely,
F-statistic and information gain criteria are considered here for ranking.
Finally, five different classifiers, namely, Naive Bayes, multilayer perceptron
neural network, logistic regression, classification and regression tree (CART),
RBF neural network have been trained and tested by 888 erythrocytes (infected and
noninfected) for each features' subset. Performance evaluation of the proposed
methodology shows that multilayer perceptron network provides higher accuracy for
malaria-infected erythrocytes recognition and infected stage classification.
Results show that top 90 features ranked by F-statistic (specificity: 98.64%,
sensitivity: 100%, PPV: 99.73% and overall accuracy: 96.84%) and top 60 features 
ranked by information gain provides better results (specificity: 97.29%,

BACKGROUND: Control of mosquitoes requires the ability to evaluate new
insecticides and to monitor resistance to existing insecticides. Monitoring tools
should be flexible and low cost so that they can be deployed in remote, resource 
poor areas. Ideally, a bioassay should be able to simulate transient contact
between mosquitoes and insecticides, and it should allow for excito-repellency
and avoidance behaviour in mosquitoes. Presented here is a new bioassay, which
has been designed to meet these criteria. This bioassay was developed as part of 
the Mosquito Contamination Device (MCD) project and, therefore, is referred to as
the MCD bottle bioassay.
METHODS: Presented here are two experiments that serve as a proof-of-concept for 
the MCD bottle bioassay. The experiments used four insecticide products, ranging 
from fast-acting, permethrin-treated, long-lasting insecticide nets (LLINs) that 
are already widely used for malaria vector control, to the slower acting
entomopathogenic fungus, Beauveria bassiana, that is currently being evaluated as
a prospective biological insecticide. The first experiment used the MCD bottle to
test the effect of four different insecticides on Anopheles stephensi with a
range of exposure times (1 minute, 3 minutes, 1 hour). The second experiment is a
direct comparison of the MCD bottle and World Health Organization (WHO) cone
bioassay that tests a subset of the insecticides (a piece of LLIN and a piece of 
netting coated with B. bassiana spores) and a further reduced exposure time (5
seconds) against both An. stephensi and Anopheles gambiae. Immediate knockdown
and mortality after 24 hours were assessed using logistic regression and daily
survival was assessed using Cox proportional hazards models.
RESULTS: Across both experiments, fungus performed much more consistently than
the chemical insecticides but measuring the effect of fungus required monitoring 
of mosquito mortality over several days to a week. Qualitatively, the MCD bottle 
and WHO cone performed comparably, although knockdown and 24 hour mortality
tended to be higher in some, but not all, groups of mosquitoes exposed using the 
WHO cone.
CONCLUSION: The MCD bottle is feasible as a flexible, low-cost method for testing
insecticidal materials. It is promising as a tool for testing transient contact
and for capturing the effects of mosquito behavioural responses to insecticides.

BACKGROUND: For the past decades, developing countries have received considerable
support to fight infectious illnesses in their homelands. This global effort has 
tremendously reduced case fatality rates associated with illnesses such as
HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria in many countries. However, this information
is still missing in some developing countries, hindering international effort for
control programs; we designed this study in effort to close this gap.
METHODS: Data on 23,487 inpatients from Kinshasa hospitals were gathered and
analyzed using EpiData and SPSS. Major illnesses affecting inpatients were
identified; mortality and case fatality rates associated with each such illness
were estimated. Case fatality rates associated with each illness were compared
between consecutive years. Socio demographic and economic factors associated with
mortality due to HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria were investigated using logistic
regression.
RESULTS: The outstanding findings were that case fatality rates associated with
major illnesses were relatively higher in 2008 than in the previous year;
inpatients hospitalized for HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria in 2008 were more likely to 
die than those hospitalized in the previous year. Low socioeconomic status
inpatients hospitalized for malaria, HIV/AIDS or TB were more likely to die than 
high socioeconomic status inpatients (AOR 0.29, 95% CI 0.22-0.40; AOR 0.20,
95%CI0.12-0.33; AOR 0.33, 95%CI 0.21-0.53), even though both groups presumably
had access to free life-saving treatment and care.
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that while improvement in health indicators
greatly depends on funds availability and sustainability, these alone might not
be enough in resource poor developing countries. Other factors, i.e., population 
SES also need to be addressed before needed changes may occur.

severe malaria.

Vitamin D plays an increasingly recognized role in the innate and adaptive immune
response to infection. Based on demonstrated roles in up-regulating innate
immunity, decreasing inflammation, and reducing the severity of disease in
illnesses such as tuberculosis and influenza, we hypothesized that poor vitamin D
status would be associated with severe malaria. We measured 25-hydroxyvitamin D
[25(OH)D] by immunoassay in a sample of Ugandan children aged 18 months-12 years 
with severe malaria (cerebral malaria or severe malarial anemia, n = 40) and in
healthy community children (n = 20). Ninety-five percent of children with severe 
malaria (n = 38) and 80% of control children (n = 16) were vitamin D-insufficient
[plasma 25(OH)D <30 ng/mL]. Mean plasma 25(OH)D levels were significantly lower
in children with severe malaria than in community children (21.2 vs. 25.3 ng/mL, 
p = 0.03). Logistic regression revealed that for every 1 ng/mL increase in plasma
25(OH)D, the odds of having severe malaria declined by 9% [OR = 0.91 (95% CI:
0.84, 1.0)]. These preliminary results suggest that vitamin D insufficiency may
play a role in the development of severe malaria. Further prospective studies in 
larger cohorts are indicated to confirm the relationship of vitamin D levels to
severity of malaria infection and to investigate causality.

BACKGROUND: Insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) have proven instrumental in the
successful reduction of malaria incidence in holoendemic regions during the past 
decade. As distribution of ITNs throughout sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is being
scaled up, maintaining maximal levels of coverage will be necessary to sustain
current gains. The effectiveness of mass distribution of ITNs, requires careful
analysis of successes and failures if impacts are to be sustained over the long
term.
METHODS: Mass distribution of ITNs to a rural Kenyan community along Lake
Victoria was performed in early 2011. Surveyors collected data on ITN use both
before and one year following this distribution. At both times, household
representatives were asked to provide a complete accounting of ITNs within the
dwelling, the location of each net, and the ages and genders of each person who
slept under that net the previous night. Other data on household material
possessions, education levels and occupations were recorded. Information on
malaria preventative factors such as ceiling nets and indoor residual spraying
was noted. Basic information on malaria knowledge and health-seeking behaviours
was also collected. Patterns of ITN use before and one year following net
distribution were compared using spatial and multi-variable statistical methods. 
Associations of ITN use with various individual, household, demographic and
malaria related factors were tested using logistic regression.
RESULTS: After infancy (<1 year), ITN use sharply declined until the late teenage
years then began to rise again, plateauing at 30 years of age. Males were less
likely to use ITNs than females. Prior to distribution, socio-economic factors
such as parental education and occupation were associated with ITN use. Following
distribution, ITN use was similar across social groups. Household factors such as
availability of nets and sleeping arrangements still reduced consistent net use, 
however.
CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive, direct-to-household, mass distribution of ITNs was
effective in rapidly scaling up coverage, with use being maintained at a high
level at least one year following the intervention. Free distribution of ITNs
through direct-to-household distribution method can eliminate important
constraints in determining consistent ITN use, thus enhancing the sustainability 
of effective intervention campaigns.

BACKGROUND: Malaria is major public health problem in Senegal. In some parts of
the country, it occurs almost permanently with a seasonal increase during the
rainy season. There is evidence to suggest that the prevalence of malaria in
Senegal has decreased considerably during the past few years. Recent data from
the Senegalese National Malaria Control Programme (NMCP) indicates that the
number of malaria cases decrease from 1,500,000 in 2006 to 174,339 in 2010. With 
the decline of malaria morbidity in Senegal, the characterization of the new
epidemiological profile of this disease is crucial for public health decision
makers.
METHODS: SaTScan™ software using the Kulldorf method of retrospective space-time 
permutation and the Bernoulli purely spatial model was used to identify malaria
clusters using confirmed malaria cases in 74 villages. ArcMAp was used to map
malaria hotspots. Logistic regression was used to investigate risk factors for
malaria hotspots in Keur Soce health and demographic surveillance site.
RESULTS: A total of 1,614 individuals in 440 randomly selected households were
enrolled. The overall malaria prevalence was 12%. The malaria prevalence during
the study period varied from less than 2% to more than 25% from one village to
another. The results showed also that rooms located between 50 m to 100 m away
from livestock holding place [adjusted O.R = 0.7, P = 0.044, 95% C.I (1.02 -
7.42)], bed net use [adjusted O.R = 1.2, P = 0.024, 95% C.I (1.02 -1.48)], are
good predictors for malaria hotspots in the Keur Soce health and demographic
surveillance site. The socio economic status of the household also predicted on
hotspots patterns. The less poor household are 30% less likely to be classified
as malaria hotspots area compared to the poorest household [adjusted O.R = 0.7,
P = 0.014, 95% C.I (0.47 - 0.91)].
CONCLUSION: The study investigated risk factors for malaria hotspots in small
communities in the Keur Soce site. The result showed considerable variation of
malaria prevalence between villages which cannot be detected in aggregated data. 
The data presented in this paper are the first step to understanding malaria in
the Keur Soce site from a micro-geographic perspective.

AIM: In 2005, the Ghana Health Service mandated malaria and helminths
chemoprophylaxis during antenatal care visits. The aim of this study was to
investigate the prevalence of malaria and helminth infections and their
relationship with adverse birth outcomes (low birth weight, stillbirth, and
preterm) following the implementation of these treatments.
STUDY DESIGN: A quantitative cross-sectional study.
METHOD: The study was conducted on 630 women presenting for delivery in the Komfo
Anokye Teaching Hospital and the Manhyia District Hospital from July to November 
2011. Socio-demographic information and medical and obstetric history were
collected. Laboratory analyses for the presence of malaria and helminths were
performed. Association of malaria and helminths with birth outcomes was assessed 
using logistic regression to obtain odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence
intervals.
RESULTS: The prevalence of malaria, helminths and adverse birth outcomes was
9.0%, 5.0% and 22.2%, respectively. Compared with women who received malaria
prophylaxis, women without malaria prophylaxis were two times more likely to have
malaria infection (aOR = 2.1; 95% CI = 1.06-4.17). Women who were not screened
for helminths were twice as likely to be infected with helminths (aOR = 2.4; 95% 
CI = 1.15-5.12) than women who were screened for helminths. For women infected
with hookworm or Schistosoma mansoni, the odds of having an adverse birth outcome
(aOR = 3.9; 95% CI = 1.09-14.20) and stillbirth (aOR = 7.7; 95% CI = 1.21-36.38) 
were greater than for women who were not infected.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of malaria, helminths and adverse birth outcomes was
lower than previously reported 9.0% vs. 36.3, 5.0% vs. 25.7 and 22.2% vs. 44.6,
respectively. Helminth but not malaria infection was found to be significantly
associated with adverse birth outcomes.

Patterns and predictors of malaria care-seeking, diagnostic testing, and
artemisinin-based combination therapy for children under five with fever in
Northern Nigeria: a cross-sectional study.

BACKGROUND: Despite recent improvements in malaria prevention strategies, malaria
case management remains a weakness in Northern Nigeria, which is underserved and 
suffers the country's highest rates of under-five child mortality. Understanding 
malaria care-seeking patterns and comparing case management outcomes to World
Health Organization (WHO) and Nigeria's National Malaria Control Programme (NMCP)
guidelines are necessary to identify where policy and programmatic strategies
should focus to prevent malaria mortality and morbidity.
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey based on lot quality assurance sampling was
used to collect data on malaria care-seeking for children under five with fever
in the last two weeks throughout Sokoto and Bauchi States. The survey assessed if
the child received NMCP/WHO recommended case management: prompt treatment, a
diagnostic blood test, and artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT).
Deviations from this pathway and location of treatment were also assessed.
Lastly, logistic regression was used to assess predictors of seeking treatment.
RESULTS: Overall, 76.7% of children were brought to treatment-45.5% to a patent
medicine vendor and 43.8% to a health facility. Of children brought to treatment,
61.5% sought treatment promptly, but only 9.8% received a diagnostic blood test
and 7.2% received a prompt ACT. When assessing adherence to the complete case
management pathway, only 1.0% of children received NMCP/WHO recommended
treatment. When compared to other treatment locations, health facilities provided
the greatest proportion of children with NMCP/WHO recommended treatment. Lastly, 
children 7-59 months old were at 1.74 (p = 0.003) greater odds of receiving
treatment than children ≤6 months.
CONCLUSIONS: Northern Nigeria's coverage rates of NMCP/WHO standard malaria case 
management for children under five with fever fall short of the NMCP goal of 80% 
coverage by 2010 and universal coverage thereafter. Given the ability to treat a 
child with malaria differs greatly between treatment locations, policy and
logistics planning should address the shortages of essential malaria supplies in 
recommended and frequently accessed treatment locations. Particular emphasis
should be placed on integrating the private sector into standardized care and
educating caregivers on the necessity for testing before treatment and the
availability of free ACT in public health facilities for uncomplicated malaria.

Prevalence and risk factors for Plasmodium falciparum malaria in pregnant women
attending antenatal clinic in Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina Faso).

Cisse M, Sangare I, Lougue G, Bamba S, Bayane D, Guiguemde RT.

BACKGROUND: Malaria during pregnancy remains a serious public health problem. The
aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and possible risk factors for
malaria in pregnant women attending antenatal clinic at two primary health
facilities in Bobo-Dioulasso.
METHODS: We conducted a cross sectional study from September to December 2010 in 
two primary health facilities located in the periurban area of Bobo-Dioulasso.
Pregnant women attending antenatal clinic (ANC) were included in the study after 
signing informed consent. For each participant, the social-demographic profile,
malaria and obstetric histories were investigated through a questionnaire.
Peripheral blood was collected and thick and thin blood smears were prepared to
check Plasmodium falciparum parasitaemia. Hemoglobin concentration was measured. 
The associations between age, parity, gestational age, schooling, number of ANC
visits, use of IPTp-SP, use of insecticide-treated nets (ITN) and anemia with the
occurrence of P. falciparum malaria infection during pregnancy were analyzed
through logistic regression.
RESULTS: During the period of study, 105 (18.1%) out of 579 pregnant women were
infected by P. falciparum. The hemoglobin concentration mean was 10.5 ± 1.7/dL
and was significantly lower in pregnant women with malaria infection (9.8 g/dL
±1.6) than in those who had no malaria infection (10.6 g/dL ±1.7) (P < 0.001).
Multivariate analysis indicated that, education (AOR 1.9, 95% CI = [1.2-3.2]),
parity [primigravidae (AOR 5.0, 95% CI = [2.5-9.8]) and secundigravidae (AOR 2.1,
95% CI = [1.2-3.8])], and anaemia (AOR 2.1, 95% CI = [1.3-3.5]) were
significantly associated with P. falciparum malaria infection. The use of IPTp-SP
was not associated with P. falciparum malaria infection.
CONCLUSIONS: P. falciparum malaria infection is common in pregnant women
attending antenatal clinic and anaemia is an important complication. The results 
show that the use of IPTp-SP does not reduce the risk of malaria incidence during
pregnancy.

BACKGROUND: Malaria is the leading cause of death in Mozambique in children under
five years old. In 2009, Mozambique developed a novel bed net distribution model 
to increase coverage, based on assumptions about sleeping patterns. The coverage 
and impact of a bed net distribution campaign using this model in four districts 
in Sofala Province, Mozambique was evaluated.
METHODS: Paired household, cross-sectional surveys were conducted one month after
the 2010 distribution of 140,000 bed nets and again 14 months after the campaign 
in 2011. During household visits, malaria blood smears were performed and
haemoglobin levels were assessed on children under five and data on bed net
ownership, access and use were collected; these indicators were analysed at
individual, household and community levels. Logistic regression was used to
evaluate predictors of malaria infection and anaemia.
RESULTS: The campaign reached 98% (95% CI: 97-99%) of households registered
during the precampaign listing, with 81% (95% CI: 77-85%) of sleeping spaces
covered by campaign bed nets and 85% (95% CI: 81-88%) of the population sleeping 
in a sleeping space with a campaign bed net designated for the sleeping space.
One year after the campaign, 65% (95% CI: 57-72%) of sleeping spaces were
observed to have hanging bed nets. The proportion of sleeping spaces for which
bed nets were reported used four or more times per week was 65% (95% CI: 56-74%) 
in the wet season and 60% (95% CI: 52-68%) in the dry season. Malaria
parasitaemia prevalence in children under five years old was 47% (95% CI: 40-54%)
in 2010 and 36% (95% CI: 27-45%) in 2011. Individual-level malaria infection and 
anaemia were significantly associated with community-level use of bed nets.
CONCLUSIONS: The campaign using the novel distribution model achieved high
coverage, although usage was not uniformly high. A significant decrease in
malaria parasitaemia prevalence a year after the campaign was not observed, but
community-level use of bed nets was significantly associated with a reduced risk 
for malaria infection and anaemia in children under five.

Exchanging and using research evidence in health policy networks: a statistical
network analysis.

Shearer JC, Dion M, Lavis JN.

BACKGROUND: Evidence-informed health policymaking is a goal of equitable and
effective health systems but occurs infrequently in reality. Past research points
to the facilitating role of interpersonal relationships between policy-makers and
researchers, imploring the adoption of a social network lens. This study aims to 
identify network-level factors associated with the exchange and use of research
evidence in policymaking.
METHODS: Data on social networks and research use were collected from seventy
policy actors across three health policy cases in Burkina Faso (child health,
malaria, and HIV). Networks were graphed for actors' interactions, their
provision of, and request for research evidence. Exponential random graph models 
estimated the probability of evidence provision and request between actors,
controlling for network- and individual-level covariates. Logistic regression
models estimated actors' use of research evidence to inform policy.
RESULTS: Network structure explained more than half of the evidence exchanges
(ties) observed in these networks. Across all cases, a pair of actors was more
likely to form a provision tie if they already had a request tie between them and
visa versa (θ=6.16, p<0.05; θ=2.87, p<0.05; θ=2.31, p<0.05). The child health
network displayed clustering tendencies, meaning that actors were more likely to 
form ties if they shared an acquaintance (θ=2.36, p<0.05). Actors' use of
research evidence was positively associated with their centrality (i.e.,
connectedness).
CONCLUSIONS: The exchange and use of research evidence in policymaking can be
partly explained by the structure of actors' networks of relationships. Efforts
to support knowledge translation and evidence-informed policymaking should
consider network factors.

BACKGROUND: Low rates of adherence to artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT)
regimens increase the risk of treatment failure and may lead to drug resistance, 
threatening the sustainability of current anti-malarial efforts. We assessed the 
impact of text message reminders on adherence to ACT regimens.
METHODS: Health workers at hospitals, clinics, pharmacies, and other stationary
ACT distributors in Tamale, Ghana provided flyers advertising free mobile health 
information to individuals receiving malaria treatment. The messaging system
automatically randomized self-enrolled individuals to the control group or the
treatment group with equal probability; those in the treatment group were further
randomly assigned to receive a simple text message reminder or the simple
reminder plus an additional statement about adherence in 12-hour intervals. The
main outcome was self-reported adherence based on follow-up interviews occurring 
three days after treatment initiation. We estimated the impact of the messages on
treatment completion using logistic regression.
RESULTS: 1140 individuals enrolled in both the study and the text reminder
system. Among individuals in the control group, 61.5% took the full course of
treatment. The simple text message reminders increased the odds of adherence
(adjusted OR 1.45, 95% CI [1.03 to 2.04], p-value 0.028). Receiving an additional
message did not result in a significant change in adherence (adjusted OR 0.77,
95% CI [0.50 to 1.20], p-value 0.252).
CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that a simple text message reminder
can increase adherence to antimalarial treatment and that additional information 
included in messages does not have a significant impact on completion of ACT
treatment. Further research is needed to develop the most effective text message 
content and frequency.

BACKGROUND: Artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) has been the first-line
treatment for uncomplicated malaria in Cameroon since 2004 and Nigeria since
2005, though many febrile patients receive less effective antimalarials. Patients
often rely on providers to select treatment, and interventions are needed to
improve providers' practice and encourage them to adhere to clinical guidelines.
METHODS: Providers' adherence to malaria treatment guidelines was examined using 
data collected in Cameroon and Nigeria at public and mission facilities,
pharmacies and drug stores. Providers' choice of antimalarial was investigated
separately for each country. Multilevel logistic regression was used to determine
whether providers were more likely to choose ACT if they knew it was the
first-line antimalarial. Multiple imputation was used to impute missing data that
arose when linking exit survey responses to details of the provider responsible
for selecting treatment.
RESULTS: There was a gap between providers' knowledge and their practice in both 
countries, as providers' decision to supply ACT was not significantly associated 
with knowledge of the first-line antimalarial. Providers were, however, more
likely to supply ACT if it was the type of antimalarial they prefer. Other
factors were country-specific, and indicated providers can be influenced by what 
they perceived their patients prefer or could afford, as well as information
about their symptoms, previous treatment, the type of outlet and availability of 
ACT.
CONCLUSIONS: Public health interventions to improve the treatment of
uncomplicated malaria should strive to change what providers prefer, rather than 
focus on what they know. Interventions to improve adherence to malaria treatment 
guidelines should emphasize that ACT is the recommended antimalarial, and it
should be used for all patients with uncomplicated malaria. Interventions should 
also be tailored to the local setting, as there were differences between the two 
countries in providers' choice of antimalarial, and who or what influenced their 
practice.

BACKGROUND: As the geographical distribution of malaria transmission becomes
progressively clustered, identifying residual pockets of transmission is
important for research and for targeting interventions. Malarial antibody-based
surveillance is increasingly recognised as a valuable complement to classic
methods for the detection of infection foci especially at low transmission
levels. The study presents serological evidence for transmission heterogeneity
among school children in The Gambia measured during the dry, non-transmission
season.
METHODS: Healthy primary school children were randomly selected from 30 schools
across the country and screened for malaria infection (microscopy) and
antimalarial antibodies (MSP119). Antibody distribution was modelled using
2-component finite mixture model with cut-off for positivity from pooled sera set
at 2-standard deviation from the mean of the first component. Factors associated 
with a positive serological status were identified in a univariate model and then
combined in a multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression model, simultaneously 
adjusting for variations between individuals and school.
RESULTS: A total of 4140 children, 1897 (46%) boys, were enrolled with mean age
of 10.2 years (SD 2.6, range 4-20 years). Microscopy results available for 3640
(87.9%) children showed that 1.9% (69) were positive for Plasmodium falciparum
infections, most of them (97.1%, 67/69) asymptomatic. The overall seroprevalence 
was 12.7% (527/4140) with values for the schools ranging from 0.6% to 43.8%. Age 
(OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.07-1.16,) and parasite carriage (OR 3.36, 95% CI 1.95-5.79)
were strongly associated with seropositivity.
CONCLUSION: Serological responses to malaria parasites could identify individuals
who were or had been infected, and clusters of residual transmission.
Field-adapted antibody tests able to guide mass screening and treatment campaigns
would be extremely useful.

Although long-lasting insecticide-treated bednets (LLINs) have been widely used
for malaria control, little is known about how the condition of LLINs affects the
risk of malaria infection. The objective of this cross-sectional study was to
examine the association between the use of LLINs with holes and
caregiver-reported malaria diagnosed in children under five years of age (U5).
Data were collected in Boboye health district, Niger, in 2010. Surveyors
conducted interviews and bednet inspections in 1,034 households. If a household
had a U5 child, the surveyor asked the caregiver whether the child had
experienced a fever episode in the past two weeks that entailed standard
treatment for uncomplicated malaria at a healthcare facility. The authors
analyzed the association between the use of LLINs with holes and
caregiver-reported malaria episodes in U5 children using logistic regression,
adjusted for possible confounders. Of the 1,165 children included in the
analysis, approximately half (53.3%) used an intact LLIN while far fewer (10.6%) 
used a LLIN with holes. Compared to children using an intact LLIN, children using
a LLIN with holes were significantly more likely to have a caregiver-reported
malaria episode (8.7% vs. 17.1%; odds ratio: 2.23; 95% confidence interval:
1.24-4.01). In this study site, LLINs with holes were less protective than intact
LLINs.

BACKGROUND: Oxygen saturation is a good marker for disease severity in emergency 
care. However, studies have not considered its use in identifying individuals
infected with Plasmodium falciparum at risk of deaths.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence and predictive value of hypoxaemia for
deaths in under-5s with severe falciparum malaria infection.
METHODS: Oxygen saturation was prospectively measured alongside other indicators 
of disease severity in 369 under-5s admitted to a tertiary hospital in Nigeria.
Participants were children in whom falciparum malaria parasitaemia was confirmed 
with blood film microscopy in the presence of any of the World Health
Organization-defined life-threatening features for malaria.
RESULTS: Overall mortality rate was 8.1%. Of the 16 indicators of the disease
severity assessed, hypoxaemia (OR=7.54; 95% CI=2.80, 20.29), co-morbidity with
pneumonia (OR=19.27; 95% CI=2.87, 29.59), metabolic acidosis (OR=6.21; 95%
CI=2.21, 17.47) and hypoglycaemia (OR=19.71; 95% CI=2.61, 25.47) were independent
predictors of death. Cerebral malaria, male gender, wasting, hypokalaemia,
hyponatriaemia, azotaemia and renal impairment were significantly associated with
death in univariate analysis but not logistic regression model.
CONCLUSIONS: Hypoxaemia predicts deaths in Nigerian children with severe malaria,
irrespective of other features. Efforts should always be made to measure oxygen
saturation as part of the treatments for severe malaria in children.

BACKGROUND: In African highland areas where endemicity of malaria varies greatly 
according to altitude and topography, parasitaemia accompanied by fever may not
be sufficient to define an episode of clinical malaria in endemic areas. To
evaluate the effectiveness of malaria interventions, age-specific case
definitions of clinical malaria needs to be determined. Cases of clinical malaria
through active case surveillance were quantified in a highland area in Kenya and 
defined clinical malaria for different age groups.
METHODS: A cohort of over 1,800 participants from all age groups was selected
randomly from over 350 houses in 10 villages stratified by topography and
followed for two-and-a-half years. Participants were visited every two weeks and 
screened for clinical malaria, defined as an individual with malaria-related
symptoms (fever [axillary temperature≥37.5°C], chills, severe malaise, headache
or vomiting) at the time of examination or 1-2 days prior to the examination in
the presence of a Plasmodium falciparum positive blood smear. Individuals in the 
same cohort were screened for asymptomatic malaria infection during the low and
high malaria transmission seasons. Parasite densities and temperature were used
to define clinical malaria by age in the population. The proportion of fevers
attributable to malaria was calculated using logistic regression models.
RESULTS: Incidence of clinical malaria was highest in valley bottom population
(5.0% cases per 1,000 population per year) compared to mid-hill (2.2% cases per
1,000 population per year) and up-hill (1.1% cases per 1,000 population per year)
populations. The optimum cut-off parasite densities through the determination of 
the sensitivity and specificity showed that in children less than five years of
age, 500 parasites per μl of blood could be used to define the malaria
attributable fever cases for this age group. In children between the ages of
5-14, a parasite density of 1,000 parasites per μl of blood could be used to
define the malaria attributable fever cases. For individuals older than 14 years,
the cut-off parasite density was 3,000 parasites per μl of blood.
CONCLUSION: Clinical malaria case definitions are affected by age and endemicity,
which needs to be taken into consideration during evaluation of interventions.

BACKGROUND: The WHO recommends supervised administration of
sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) as intermittent preventive treatment for malaria 
(IPTp) during pregnancy. Logistical constraints have however favoured
unsupervised intake of SP-IPTp, casting doubts whether recent guidelines
requiring more frequent intake can be effectively implemented. To propose
strategies for enhancing compliance under limited supervision, this study sought 
to identify pregnant women's knowledge and practices gaps as well as determine
predictors of compliance with SP-IPTp, given under limited supervision.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 700 women used exit interviews at an urban
clinic in Uganda to obtain a descriptive summary of demographic and obstetric
characteristics, including knowledge, practice and experiences with SP.
Predictors of compliance with SP intake instructions were explored using logistic
regression.
RESULTS: Median age of respondents was 25 (IQR 22-28) and median parity was two
(IQR one to three) while median number of antenatal clinic (ANC) visits was 3.0
(IQR three to four). Most women had completed primary (36%) or ordinary secondary
education (25.6%) while 16.1% had not completed primary education. Awareness
about SP was high (99.4%) although correct knowledge regarding its use in
pregnancy was low (57%), with 15.4% thinking it was used to treat malaria and
26.7% lacking any idea about its use. Correct knowledge on SP use during
pregnancy significantly predicted compliance with SP-IPTp instructions (OR 1.98, 
C.I. 1.12-3.55), while age, education level, parity, number of ANC visits, or
history of unwanted effects with SP did not. SP was mostly accessed from
hospitals (64.4%) followed by private clinics (16.9%) both for preventive and
treatment purposes. SP was considered safe by most women, who were willing to
take it again in future, without supervision.
CONCLUSION: Despite high awareness, knowledge of SP as an intervention for
malaria prevention in pregnancy was low. Correct knowledge on use of SP predicted
compliance with SP-IPTp intake instructions. Focused malaria-related education
during ANC visits may improve compliance with SP intake amidst limited
supervision.

Health Sciences, P,O, Box 7072, Kampala, Uganda. ononge2006@yahoo.com.

BACKGROUND: Anaemia in pregnancy is a major public health problem especially in
the low-income countries where it is highly prevalent. There has been no recent
study in Uganda about the factors associated with anaemia in pregnancy. We aimed 
to assess the current haemoglobin (Hb) status and factors associated with anaemia
(Hb < 11.0 g/dl) in pregnant women in Mpigi, Uganda.
METHODS: We assessed Hb levels of 2436 pregnant women at 28+ weeks of gestation
at six health facilities, who were approached to participate in a stepped-wedge
cluster-randomised trial of antenatal distribution of misoprostol (for
self-administration after home birth or when oxytocin is not available). Women
were administered a questionnaire and their baseline blood haemoglobin was
examined using portable HemoCueR Hb 301 system. Predictors of anaemia were
estimated using linear and logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: The mean Hb was 11.5 (± 1.38) g/dl and prevalence of anaemia (Hb < 11.0 
g/dl) was 32.5% (95% CI 30.6%, 34.3%). After adjusting for measured confounders, 
factors associated with increased risk of anaemia in pregnancy were malaria
infection (OR: 1.32, 95% CI: 1.11, 1.58), Human Immuno-deficiency Virus infection
(OR: 2.13, 95% CI: 1.36, 2.90) and lack of iron supplementation (OR: 1.66, 95%
CI: 1.36, 2.03). Intermittent presumptive treatment of malaria, maternal age and 
parity showed a weak association with anaemia in pregnancy
CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of anaemia in pregnancy in our setting highlights
the need to put more effort in the fight against malaria and HIV, and also ensure
that pregnant women access iron supplements early in pregnancy.

BACKGROUND: Malaria in pregnancy is a major public health concern, contributing
to roughly 11% of neonatal deaths and to 25% of all maternal deaths in some parts
of the world. The World Health Organization has recommended priority
interventions for malaria during pregnancy, including use of insecticide-treated 
nets (ITNs), but net distribution has shifted recently to a universal coverage
paradigm rather than one targeting vulnerable populations.
METHODS: To determine whether and to what extent pregnant women are prioritized
within the household for ITN use, we assessed national survey data from 2009-2013
in 10 African countries. Proportion of pregnant women who slept under an ITN the 
previous night and 95% confidence intervals were calculated and compared between 
countries. Within-country logistic regression examined whether pregnancy was
significantly associated with ITN use the previous night compared with other risk
groups, and the predicted probability of net use for each risk group was
calculated holding other covariates constant.
RESULTS: A median 58% of households reported owning at least 1 ITN. On average,
across all 10 countries, 35% of pregnant women in households with at least 1 ITN 
used a net. Households with universal coverage (at least 1 ITN per 2 people) had 
higher levels of net use among all family members; for example, 79% of pregnant
women, on average, used a net in such households. In all countries, the predicted
probability of ITN use by pregnant women was significantly higher than the
probability of net use by most other household members except non-pregnant women 
of reproductive age.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that both pregnant women and non-pregnant
women of reproductive age are being prioritized within the household for net use.
However, behavior change communication strategies are needed to achieve ITN use
goals for pregnant women.

We evaluated the status of Clonorchis sinensis infection and potential risk
factors among residents of riverside areas (Geumgang) in Muju-gun, Jeollabuk-do
(Province), Korea. From January to February 2010, a total of 349 (171 males, 178 
females) stool samples were collected and examined by the formalin-ether
concentration technique. Also, village residents were interviewed using
questionnaires to obtain information about C. sinensis infection-related risk
factors. Overall egg-positive rate of C. sinensis was 13.2%. Egg-positive rates
were significantly higher in males, farmers, and residents who had lived there
more than 20 years, and in residents who had eaten raw freshwater fish than in
opposite groups, respectively. However, there was no significant difference
between age groups, education levels, cigarette smoking, alcohol drinking, health
status, past history of infection, and experience of clonorchiasis medication and
examination. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine risk factors
for clonorchiasis. On univariate analysis, the odds ratios for males, farmers,
those who had lived there more than 20 years, and who had eaten raw freshwater
fish were 2.41, 4.44, 3.16, and 4.88 times higher than those of the opposites,
respectively. On multivariate analysis, the odds ratio of residents who had eaten
raw freshwater fish was 3.2-fold higher than that of those who had not. These
results indicate that residents living in Muju-gun, along the Geum River, Korea, 
have relatively high C. sinensis egg-positive rates, and the habit of eating raw 
freshwater fish was the major factor for the maintenance of clonorchiasis.

Education attainment of head of households associated with insecticide-treated
net utilization among five to nineteen-year old individuals: evidence from the
malaria indicator survey 2010 in Zambia.

50110, Lusaka, Zambia. sichandem@gmail.com.

BACKGROUND: Education attainment may be a factor potentially influencing
health-seeking behaviour of individuals. The effect of the level of education
attainment of head of households of five to nineteen year old individuals in
Zambia on ITN utilization was investigated.
METHODS: Data stem from the 2010 Malaria Indicator Survey, which covered the
entire Zambia, was used in this study. Of the total number of five to 19-year
olds (n = 7,429), only 65% (4, 810) met the inclusion criteria for this study.
The education level of the head of households was taken as a household variable
and was categorized as "never been to school" for those who had never enrolled in
school, Primary for Grades 1 to 7, Secondary for Grades 8 to 12 and Tertiary for 
beyond Grade 12. Multivariate Logistic regression was used to determine adjusted 
odds ratios that estimated the effect of education on ITN utilization after
controlling for residence, sex, age group and other background factors.
RESULTS: Overall (n = 4,810), 48.5% were males and 51.5% were females with the
median age of 10 years and 11 years respectively. The ITN utilization among the
five to 19 year old individuals from households with the head having Primary and 
Secondary education were not statistically significant from those who came from
households where the head had never been to school. However, those who came from 
households with the head having tertiary education attainment were 1.7 times more
likely to have slept under an ITN a night before the survey than those from
households headed by individuals who never attended school or had primary
education. (AOR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.19-2.41). Of the eligible population, 35% were
excluded from the study due to incomplete records.
CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that tertiary education of the head of head of
the household might be important in influencing health behaviour of the members
of households. Therefore, health education messages focussing on strategies that 
aim to increase ITN utilization need to account for these differential variations
associated with education attainment in communities.

University, Bahir Dar, Ethiopia. abejegedefaw@gmail.com.

BACKGROUND: Drug use during pregnancy may be dangerous to the fetus. There is
high consumption of prescribed drugs among pregnant women. This condition may be 
much higher in developing countries. There is no sufficient evidence on
prescribed drug use among pregnant women in Bahir Dar town. The aim of this study
was to assess the level of prescribed drug use and associated factors among
pregnant women attending antenatal care (ANC) service at government health
centers in Bahir Dar city administration.
METHODS: Institution based cross sectional study was used. Data were collected
from randomly selected 510 pregnant women. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 
16.0. Back ward stepwise logistic regression model was used and p-values <0.05
were considered statistically significant.
RESULT: A total of 510 pregnant women were included in the study of which 88.4%
were prescribed at least one drug during pregnancy. Nearly 11% of the pregnant
women were prescribed with drugs from category D or X of the US-FDA risk
classification.Prescribed drug use among pregnant women was more likely when the 
pregnancy is wanted, (AOR = 2.4, 95% CI: 1.3 - 4.6), if the mother had maternal
illness (AOR = 8.5, 95% CI: 5.4-13.4), when the educational level of ANC provider
is diploma (AOR = 2.7, 95% CI: 1.5-4.7) and when number of pregnancies is more
(AOR =2.1, 95% CI: 1.3-3.3).
CONCLUSION: Prescribed drug use including those with potential harm to the fetus 
during pregnancy was very high in Bahir Dar city administration. Prescribed drug 
use is more when the woman had illness, when the woman was multi gravida and when
the educational level of ANC provider was low (diploma). It is important to

BACKGROUND: There is a remarkable dearth of literature on less pronounced
outcomes in malaria, namely prolonged hospitalization and intensive care
requirement. Limitations on routine clinical applicability of the World Health
Organization's (WHO) guidelines for determination of severity in malaria does
result in underestimation of the true burden of clinicians' perceived severity in
malaria. This study was conducted to evaluate the clinico-laboratory and malarial
severity features to determine their association with mortality, prolonged
hospitalization and requirement of intensive care outcomes.
METHODS: A tertiary care hospital based retrospective study was conducted from
the year 2007 to 2011 among microscopically proven adult malaria patients.
Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the factors associated
with mortality, more than seven days hospitalization, intensive care and other
supportive requirements.
RESULTS: Of a total of 922 malaria cases studied, more than seven days of
hospitalization was the most frequent outcome (21.8% (201), 95% CI=19.1-24.5%)
followed by intensive care requirement (8.6% (79), 95% CI=6.8-10.4%) and
in-hospital mortality (1.2% (11), 95% CI=0.5-1.9%). Odds of mortality were
significantly higher with cerebral malaria, pulmonary oedema/acute respiratory
distress syndrome (PE/ARDS), liver dysfunction, severe anaemia, renal failure,
respiratory distress, metabolic acidosis and leucocytosis. More than seven days
hospitalization had inverse association with mortality. Plasmodium falciparum
infection, more than three days of history of fever, haemoglobinuria, renal
failure, shock, leucocytosis, severe thrombocytopaenia and every 10 mmHg fall in 
systolic blood pressure were the independent predictors of more than seven days
of hospitalization. More than three days of history of fever, cerebral malaria,
PE/ARDS, renal failure, metabolic acidosis, hyperparasitaemia, leucocytosis and
severe thrombocytopaenia were independently associated factors with intensive
care requirement.
CONCLUSIONS: For routine clinical settings, severity definition for malaria needs
to be redefined or modified from the existing WHO guidelines. Leucocytosis and
severe thrombocytopaenia should be identified as severity determinant in malaria.
Patients having more than three days history of fever, leucocytosis, severe
thrombocytopaenia and renal failure are more likely to require either prolonged
hospitalization and/or intensive care. PE/ARDS alone in Plasmodium vivax may
result in mortality, whereas multiorgan involvement is common in P. falciparum
related mortalities.

BACKGROUND: With dwindling malaria cases in Bhutan in recent years, the
government of Bhutan has made plans for malaria elimination by 2016. This study
aimed to determine coverage, use and ownership of LLINs, as well as the
prevalence of asymptomatic malaria at a single time-point, in four sub-districts 
of Bhutan.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out in August 2013. Structured
questionnaires were administered to a single respondent in each household (HH) in
four sub-districts. Four members from 25 HH, randomly selected from each
sub-district, were tested using rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) for asymptomatic
Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax infection. Multivariable logistic
regression models were used to identify factors associated with LLIN use and
maintenance.
RESULTS: All blood samples from 380 participants tested negative for Plasmodium
infections. A total of 1,223 HH (92.5% of total HH) were surveyed for LLIN
coverage and use. Coverage of LLINs was 99.0% (1,203/1,223 HH). Factors
associated with decreased odds of sleeping under a LLIN included: washing LLINs
<six months and >nine months compared to washing LLINs every six months; HH in
the least poor compared to the most poor socio-economic quintile; a HH income of 
Nu 5,001-10,000 (US$1 = Nu 59.55), and Nu >10,000, compared to HH with income of 
<Nu 1,500; HH located one to three hours walking distance to a health centre
compared to being located closer to a health centre; a reported lack of knowledge
as to what to do in event of LLINs being torn; and keeping LLINs in a box
compared to keeping them hanging in the place of use. Factors associated with use
of LLINs for purposes other than the intended use included: income group Nu
1,501-3,000 and HH located one to three hours walking distance from a health
centre.
CONCLUSIONS: There was high coverage of LLINs in the study area with regular use 
of LLINs throughout the year. LLIN use for purposes other than malaria prevention
was low. With high coverage and regular use of LLINs, and a zero prevalence of
malaria infection found in historically high-risk communities during the peak
malaria season, it appears Bhutan is on course to achieve malaria elimination.

BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis and timely treatment of malaria is recognized as a
fundamental element to the control of the disease. Although access to health
services in Tanzania is improved, still many people seek medical care when it is 
too late or not at all. This study aimed to determine factors associated with
delay in seeking treatment for fever among children under five in Tanzania.
METHODS: A three-stage cluster sampling design was used to sample households with
children under five in Dodoma region, central Tanzania between October 2010 and
January 2011. Information on illness and health-seeking behaviours in the
previous four weeks was collected using a structured questionnaire. A
multivariable logistic regression was used to investigate determinants of delay
in treatment-seeking behaviour while accounting for sample design.
RESULTS: A total of 287 under-five children with fever whose caretakers sought
medical care were involved in the study. Of these, 55.4% were taken for medical
care after 24 hours of onset of fever. The median time of delay in fever care
seeking was two days. Children who lived with both biological parents were less
likely to be delayed for medical care compared to those with either one or both
of their biological parents absent from home (OR = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.24, 0.74).
Children from households with two to three under-five children were more likely
to be delayed for medical care compared to children from households with only one
child (OR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.04, 2.26). Also, children living in a distance ≥5
kilometres from the nearest health facility were about twice (95% CI: 1.11, 2.72)
as likely to delay to be taken for medical care than those in the shorter
distances.
CONCLUSION: Living with non-biological parents, high number of under-fives in
household, and long distance to the nearest health facility were important
factors for delay in seeking healthcare. Programmes to improve education on
equity in social services, family planning, and access to health facilities are
required for better healthcare and development of children.

BACKGROUND: India has recently achieved the "Polio free status" by WHO with
stringent efforts of the Health Ministry to control its spread. However, we
should not forget the lessons learnt from the failure of National malaria
eradication Programme and National Tuberculosis control Programme which creates a
need to assess the probable barriers for the various National Health Programmes. 
The present article presents an overview of the Polio Eradication programme in
India highlighting the lessons learnt from the past. Also, it evaluates the
reality behind full participation of Pulse Polio Programme.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study results of a cross-sectional survey conducted
with an aim to assess the probable reasons and barriers behind non compliance of 
Pulse Polio Programme among parents of children (1-5 yr of age) of Modinagar area
have also been discussed. The survey instrument was a structured, 10 item, closed
ended questionnaire.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Chi-square test was used to analyze the difference
between proportions of individual responses for each question and multiple
logistic regression was used to assess relation between socio demographic
parameter and absence from Polio Ravivaar.
RESULTS: The study reveals a surprising 68% attendance of Pulse Polio programme
which is far behind the desired goal. Most of the parents who did not attend
polio ravivaar considered that there was no need for the repetition of Polio
vaccine (76.9%) followed by their fear that the vaccine might get contaminated
during transportation (74.5%). A significant positive association was found
between older age group of the eligible children (4-5 yr, O.R.1.52), female
gender, illiterate parents, distance of more than one km from residence to
vaccination and lack of source of information (O.R. 1.47).
CONCLUSION: Efforts should be done to investigate the probable reasons behind non
compliance for various immunization programmes to analyse the current situation
in detail and formulate appropriate programs for coming years so that the efforts
so far don't go in vain and we secure a healthy Polio free nation for our future 
generations.

BACKGROUND: Although mass distribution has been considered as the best method to 
rapidly scale up the coverage of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) for
malaria prevention, little information is available on determinants associated
with net utilization at local settings. We studied individual and household
factors associated with LLIN use in Halaba district in southern Ethiopia.
METHODS: This is a population-based survey conducted in October 2008 in 16
randomly selected villages. Data on individual and household characteristics,
LLIN ownership and use were collected through house-to-house visits. Univariate
and multiple logistic regression models were used to examine the effect of each
independent variable on LLIN use by respondents.
RESULTS: A total of 1235 households participated in the study, and 755/1235
(61.1%) had owned at least one LLIN. Among LLIN-owning households, 419/629
(66.6%) children under the age of five years and 33/55 (60.0%) pregnant women
slept under an LLIN the night before the survey. The number of LLINs hung in the 
household (adjusted OR [aOR] 13.2, 95% CI: 3.7-47.5) and knowledge about malaria 
(aOR 2.3, 95% CI: 1.2-4.5) were the two important predictors associated with
LLINs use.
CONCLUSIONS: A substantial gap between net ownership and use was identified.
Hanging nets and knowledge of malaria predict higher odds of sleeping under an
LLIN the previous night. More intensive research on factors that contribute to
low LLIN usage is needed.

BACKGROUND: New frontier settlements across the Amazon Basin pose a major
challenge for malaria elimination in Brazil. Here we describe the epidemiology of
malaria during the early phases of occupation of farming settlements in
Remansinho area, Brazilian Amazonia. We examine the relative contribution of
low-density and asymptomatic parasitemias to the overall Plasmodium vivax burden 
over a period of declining transmission and discuss potential hurdles for malaria
elimination in Remansinho and similar settings.
METHODS: Eight community-wide cross-sectional surveys, involving 584 subjects,
were carried out in Remansinho over 3 years and complemented by active and
passive surveillance of febrile illnesses between the surveys. We used
quantitative PCR to detect low-density asexual parasitemias and gametocytemias
missed by conventional microscopy. Mixed-effects multiple logistic regression
models were used to characterize independent risk factors for P. vivax infection 
and disease.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS/CONCLUSIONS: P. vivax prevalence decreased from 23.8%
(March-April 2010) to 3.0% (April-May 2013), with no P. falciparum infections
diagnosed after March-April 2011. Although migrants from malaria-free areas were 
at increased risk of malaria, their odds of having P. vivax infection and disease
decreased by 2-3% with each year of residence in Amazonia. Several findings
indicate that low-density and asymptomatic P. vivax parasitemias may complicate
residual malaria elimination in Remansinho: (a) the proportion of subpatent
infections (i.e. missed by microscopy) increased from 43.8% to 73.1% as P. vivax 
transmission declined; (b) most (56.6%) P. vivax infections were asymptomatic and
32.8% of them were both subpatent and asymptomatic; (c) asymptomatic parasite
carriers accounted for 54.4% of the total P. vivax biomass in the host
population; (d) over 90% subpatent and asymptomatic P. vivax had PCR-detectable
gametocytemias; and (e) few (17.0%) asymptomatic and subpatent P. vivax
infections that were left untreated progressed to clinical disease over 6 weeks
of follow-up and became detectable by routine malaria surveillance.

OBJECTIVES: To assess prevalence, determinants and impact of unawareness about
the health consequences of tobacco use among school personnel in Africa.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional surveys.
SETTING: Twenty-nine African countries.
PARTICIPANTS: Representative samples of school personnel from 29 African
countries (n=17 929), using data from the 2006-2011 Global School Personnel
Surveys.
OUTCOME: We assessed if school personnel were aware of the following five facts
about tobacco use: (1) tobacco use is addictive; (2) secondhand smoke exposure is
harmful; (3) smoking causes lung cancer; (4) smoking causes heart disease and (5)
smoking does not cause malaria. Using multivariate logistic regression, we
measured the impact of unawareness of the health consequences of tobacco use on
behaviour and attitudes towards tobacco control.
RESULTS: A median of 62.6% of school personnel were unaware of at least one
health consequence of tobacco use. School personnel in countries with mandatory
cigarette health warning labels had lower odds of being unaware of any health
consequence of tobacco use than countries where health warning labels were not
mandatory (adjusted OR [aOR]=0.51; 95% CI 0.37 to 0.71). A significant
dose-response relationship was seen between being ignorant of 1; 2; or ≥3 tobacco
use health consequences respectively (compared with not being ignorant of any),
and the odds of the following outcomes: non-support of bans on tobacco industry
sponsorship of school or extracurricular activities (aOR=1.47; 1.91; and 2.98);
non-support of bans on all tobacco advertisements (aOR=1.24; 1.78; and 2.68) and 
non-support of policies prohibiting tobacco use by school personnel on campus
(aOR=1.79; 4.45; and 4.56).
CONCLUSIONS: Unawareness of the health consequences of tobacco use was associated
with poor support for tobacco control policies. Intensified efforts are needed in
African countries to warn about the dangers of tobacco use.

INTRODUCTION: Plasmodium knowlesi has long been present in Malaysia, and is now
an emerging cause of zoonotic human malaria. Cases have been confirmed throughout
South-East Asia where the ranges of its natural macaque hosts and Anopheles
leucosphyrus group vectors overlap. The majority of cases are from Eastern
Malaysia, with increasing total public health notifications despite a concurrent 
reduction in Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax malaria. The public health
implications are concerning given P. knowlesi has the highest risk of severe and 
fatal disease of all Plasmodium spp in Malaysia. Current patterns of risk and
disease vary based on vector type and competence, with individual exposure risks 
related to forest and forest-edge activities still poorly defined. Clustering of 
cases has not yet been systematically evaluated despite reports of peri-domestic 
transmission and known vector competence for human-to-human transmission.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A population-based case-control study will be conducted
over a 2-year period at two adjacent districts in north-west Sabah, Malaysia.
Confirmed malaria cases presenting to the district hospital sites meeting
relevant inclusion criteria will be requested to enrol. Three community controls 
matched to the same village as the case will be selected randomly. Study
procedures will include blood sampling and administration of household and
individual questionnaires to evaluate potential exposure risks associated with
acquisition of P. knowlesi malaria. Secondary outcomes will include differences
in exposure variables between P. knowlesi and other Plasmodium spp, risk of
severe P. knowlesi malaria, and evaluation of P. knowlesi case clustering.
Primary analysis will be per protocol, with adjusted ORs for exposure risks
between cases and controls calculated using conditional multiple logistic
regression models.
ETHICS: This study has been approved by the human research ethics committees of
Malaysia, the Menzies School of Health Research, Australia, and the London School
of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, UK.

BACKGROUND: Brucellosis is the commonest zoonotic infection worldwide with
symptoms similar to other febrile syndromes such as malaria and typhoid fever. It
is often easily misdiagnosed, resulting in underreporting and misdirected
treatments. Understanding of the factors that influence brucellosis care seeking 
is essential in enhancing its effective management. Our study sought to determine
the factors associated with choice of provider in accessing care for brucellosis 
among pastoral communities in Uganda.
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional survey involving 245 randomly selected
respondents previously diagnosed and treated for brucellosis, two months before
the study. They were enrolled from three sub-counties neighboring Lake Mburo
National Park between December 2012 to April 2013. Data on socio-demographics,
availability, accessibility, affordability and acceptability of health services
were collected. A multivariable logistic regression model was fitted to determine
association between independent and outcome variables using odds ratios and 95%
confidence intervals with p-value≤0.05 considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: Of the 245 respondents, 127(51.8%) sought health care at government
facilities and the rest at private. Respondents who were less likely to choose a 
government facility were either single (OR: 0.50, CI: 0.26-0.97), had general
weakness (OR: 0.09, CI: 0.01-0.72) or whom family took a decision (OR: 0.52, CI: 
0.28-0.97). At multivariable analysis, choice of government facility was
influenced by primary education (aOR: 0.46, CI: 0.22-0.97), having six to ten
household members (aOR:3.71, CI:1.84-7.49), family advice (aOR:0.64, CI:
0.23-0.91), distance ≥10 kms (aOR:0.44, CI: 0.21-0.92), high costs at private
clinics (aOR:0.01, CI:0.02-0.15) and no diagnosis at government facility
(aOR:0.11, CI:0.01-0.97). Females were more likely to seek health care at
government facilities, while those with tertiary education were less likely,
after the first provider.
CONCLUSIONS: Females and households with six to ten members were more likely to
choose government facilities. Government facilities need to be equipped to
attract more patients.

BACKGROUND: International travel is rapidly increasing worldwide, and the
greatest increases have occurred in tropical and subtropical areas. The aim of
the survey was to investigate the pre-travel health-seeking practices of
travelers to Asian destinations.
METHODS: A questionnaire-based survey was conducted at the Athens International
Airport between the 1st of November 2011 and the 30th of April 2013.
RESULTS: A total of 1666 adult travelers participated in the study, and 69.7%
were men. The mean age of the participants was 39 years. Previous travel to
tropical countries was reported by 69% of the participants. The most frequent
destination was the Indian subcontinent (45.0%). The main reasons for travel were
visiting friends and relatives (VFRs; 36.5%) and business (32.4%). Most of the
participants traveled for <1 month (51.4%). Only 24.5% pursued pre-travel
consultations. Vaccinations were administered to 14.4% of the participants, and
of those, 77%, 73%, and 32.5% received hepatitis A, tetanus/diphtheria, and
typhoid vaccines, respectively. Malaria prophylaxis was given to 12.2% of the
participants. Logistic regression analysis revealed that being male and
unemployed, having an elementary level of education, traveling to visiting
friends and relatives, and short durations of travel were significant
determinants of not seeking pre-travel consultations.
CONCLUSION: Significant gaps were revealed in the vaccinations and malaria
prophylaxes of travelers departing to Asia. Specific educational tools should be 
developed to improve the awareness of travelers to high-risk destinations.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine an algorithm
for malaria diagnosis using presenting signs and symptoms of children (aged 0-13 
years) with uncomplicated malaria in Gwagwalada Area Council of Abuja, Nigeria.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A validated questionnaire was used to obtain relevant data
from 400 children diagnosed presumptively of simple malaria by clinicians and 400
other children of similar sex and age considered as not having malaria.
Giemsa-stained thick blood films were used to determine parasitaemia. Data
obtained was analysed using Epi-Info version 3.3.2.
RESULTS: Thirty-eight per cent of children with presumptive diagnosis of malaria 
had parasitaemia. Fever, rigor, vomiting, jaundice, pallor and spleen enlargement
had significant statistical relationship with parasitaemia on bivariate analysis,
but only fever (p=0.00), rigor (p=0.00), vomiting (p=0.00), and pallor (p=0.00)
maintained the relationship when subjected to logistic regression analysis. But
these symptoms individually had low sensitivity and/or specificity. Candidate
algorithms (combinations of symptoms) were then successively subjected to
bivariate, logistic and validity analyses. Fever with vomiting gave the highest
sensitivity (56.2%), specificity (76.4%) and PPV (60.0%) and were therefore
adopted as the algorithm of choice.
CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Children presenting with fever and vomiting
without any other obvious cause in health facilities without laboratory support
in the research area should receive antimalarial treatment, to help reduce the
malaria scourge. This algorithm should be field-tested and if found reliable
should be adopted to ease the problem of malaria diagnosis in peripheral health
facilities.

Severity in Plasmodium vivax malaria claiming global vigilance and exploration--a
tertiary care centre-based cohort study.

BACKGROUND: Mounting reports on severe Plasmodium vivax malaria from across the
globe have raised concerns among the scientific community. However, the risk of
P. vivax resulting in complicated malaria and mortality is not as firmly
established as it is with Plasmodium falciparum. This study was conducted to
determine the severity proportion and factors associated with severity in cases
of vivax and falciparum malaria.
METHODS: Adult patients microscopically diagnosed to have P. vivax/P. falciparum 
infections from the year 2007-2011 were evaluated based on their hospital
records. Severe malaria was defined as per the World Health Organization's
guidelines. Comparison was made across species and binary logistic regression was
used to determine risk factors of severity.
RESULTS: Of 922 malaria cases included in the study, P. vivax was the largest
(63.4%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 60.3-66.5%) infecting species, followed by
P. falciparum (34.4%, 95% CI 31.3-37.5%) and their mixed infection (2.2%, 95% CI 
1.3-3.2%). Severity in P. vivax and P. falciparum was noted to be 16.9% (95% CI
13.9-19.9%) and 36.3% (95% CI 31.0-41.6%) respectively. Plasmodium falciparum had
significantly higher odds [adjusted odds ratio (95% CI), 2.80 (2.04-3.83)] of
severe malaria than P. vivax. Rising respiratory rate [1.29 (1.15-1.46)], falling
systolic blood pressure [0.96 (0.93-0.99)], leucocytosis [12.87 (1.43-115.93)]
and haematuria [59.36 (13.51-260.81)] were the independent predictors of severity
in P. vivax. Increasing parasite index [2.97 (1.11-7.98)] alone was the
independent predictor of severity in P. falciparum. Mortality in vivax and
falciparum malaria was 0.34% (95% CI -0.13-0.81%) and 2.21% (95% CI 0.59-3.83%), 
respectively. Except hyperparasitaemia and shock, other complications were
associated (P < 0.05) with mortality in falciparum malaria. Pulmonary
oedema/acute respiratory distress syndrome was associated (P = 0.003) with
mortality in vivax malaria. Retrospective design of this study possesses inherent
limitations.
CONCLUSIONS: Plasmodium vivax does cause severe malaria and mortality in
substantial proportion but results in much lesser amalgamations of multi-organ
involvements than P. falciparum. Pulmonary oedema/acute respiratory distress
syndrome in P. vivax infection could lead to mortality and therefore should be
diagnosed and treated promptly. Mounting complications and its broadening
spectrum in 'not so benign' P. vivax warrants global vigilance for any probable
impositions.

BACKGROUND: In malaria-endemic countries, the absence of parasitological
confirmation of malaria infection potentially results in overtreatment of
non-malaria febrile illness with antimalarial drugs; this may lead to healthcare 
workers (HCW) missing other treatable illness or wastage of resources. This paper
presents results from nationally representative assessments of malaria diagnostic
accuracy, quality and capacity in Ghana and the Republic of Benin.
METHODS: Cross-sectional surveys were conducted in December 2012 among a
representative sample of health facilities (n=30 per country), using a modified
service provision assessment, followed by HCW observations and interviews. To
analyze the data we used χ(2) statistics and logistic regression.
RESULTS: Malaria microscopy and rapid diagnostic test interpretation was accurate
most of the time in both countries. Drugs were generally prescribed in line with 
positive malaria test results (Ghana: 85.4%, 95% CI: 72.2-98.7; Benin: 83.6%, 95%
CI: 68.7-98.4), although some patients with negative malaria test results still
received treatment (Ghana: 30.1%, 95% CI: 11.1-49.0; Benin: 37.8%, 95% CI:
22.6-53.0).
CONCLUSIONS: Diagnostics for malaria are often performed adequately and
accurately in Ghana and Benin, although diagnostic coverage within facilities
remains incomplete and some individuals who test negative for malaria receive
antimalarial drugs.

Burkina Faso has a high incidence and death rate of severe malaria, especially
for children under 5 years of age. Although the malaria elimination program is a 
high-priority public health project, finding an effective strategy for managing
the problem is a major challenge. Understanding the various factors that
contribute to the severity of malaria is essential in designing an effective
strategy. In this study, parental and environmental factors associated with
severe malaria in Burkinabè children were investigated in two hospitals in
Koudougou Health District, Burkina Faso. Between July and September 2012, a
cross-sectional study was used to test 510 children under 5 years of age (mean
age: 23.5 months) admitted with suspected malaria. Each child was screened using 
a blood smear to identify whether he or she had severe malaria based on the
criteria established by the World Health Organization (WHO). When a child was
diagnosed with malaria, either severe or not severe, the parents were interviewed
by a trained interviewer using a structured questionnaire. A logistic regression 
was used to identify the determinants of severe malaria and associated deaths. Of
the 510 children having malaria, 201 (39.4%) had severe malaria. Most of the
patients (54.9%) lived in rural areas. The main factors associated with severe
malaria were low education level of the father, low socioeconomic status [odds
ratio (OR)=4.11, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.44-11.75], delayed treatment
[OR=4.53, 95% CI=1.76-11.65], treating children at home as a typical practice
when the child has a fever [OR=3.24, 95% CI=1.40-7.51], living in rural area
[OR=6.66, 95% CI=3.36-13.22], and living beside a water gathering pond (OR=1.67, 
95% CI=1.02-2.74]. Parental and environmental context associated with severe
malaria for children under 5 years of age remains a serious public health problem
that affects malaria outcomes in resource-limited areas. Promotion of early care 
is urgently required. Parents should be given information on the risks of not
consulting a health facility when children exhibit symptoms of malaria.

BACKGROUND: Inpatient case fatality from severe malaria remains high in much of
sub-Saharan Africa. The majority of these deaths occur within 24 hours of
admission, suggesting that pre-hospital management may have an impact on the risk
of case fatality.
METHODS: Prospective cohort study, including questionnaire about pre-hospital
treatment, of all 437 patients admitted with severe febrile illness (presumed to 
be severe malaria) to the paediatric ward in Sikasso Regional Hospital, Mali, in 
a two-month period.
FINDINGS: The case fatality rate was 17.4%. Coma, hypoglycaemia and respiratory
distress at admission were associated with significantly higher mortality. In
multiple logistic regression models and in a survival analysis to examine
pre-admission risk factors for case fatality, the only consistent and significant
risk factor was sex. Girls were twice as likely to die as boys (AOR 2.00, 95% CI 
1.08-3.70). There was a wide variety of pre-hospital treatments used, both modern
and traditional. None had a consistent impact on the risk of death across
different analyses. Reported use of traditional treatments was not associated
with post-admission outcome.
INTERPRETATION: Aside from well-recognised markers of severity, the main risk
factor for death in this study was female sex, but this study cannot determine
the reason why. Differences in pre-hospital treatments were not associated with
case fatality.

BACKGROUND: Protease inhibitor-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been
associated with preterm birth in some studies. We examined risk factors for
preterm birth among women randomized to lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r)- or efavirenz
(EFV)-based ART.
METHODS: This was a planned secondary analysis of the PROMOTE-Pregnant Women and 
Infants Study, an open-label, randomized controlled trial comparing the risk of
placental malaria among HIV-infected, ART-naive pregnant Ugandan women assigned
to initiate LPV/r- or EFV-based ART at 12-28 weeks gestation. Gestational age was
determined based on last menstrual period and ultrasound biometry. All women
received bednets and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Stillbirths, spontaneous
abortions, and multiple gestations were excluded from the primary analysis.
Potential risk factors for preterm birth (<37 weeks gestation) were evaluated by 
univariate and multivariate logistic regression.
RESULTS: Three hundred fifty-six women were included in this analysis. At
enrollment, median gestational age was 21 weeks and median CD4 cell count was 368
cells per cubic millimeter. 14.7% of deliveries in the EFV arm and 16.2% in the
LPV/r arm were preterm. Preterm birth was associated with gestational weight gain
below 0.1 kg/week versus 0.1 kg/week or more [odds ratio (OR) = 2.49; 95%
confidence interval (CI): 1.38 to 4.47; P = 0.003]. Neither ART regimen of LPV/r 
versus EFV (OR = 1.12; 95% CI: 0.63 to 2.00; P = 0.69) nor placental malaria (OR 
= 0.74; 95% CI: 0.38 to 1.44; P = 0.37) was associated with preterm birth.
CONCLUSIONS: LPV/r was not associated with an increased risk of preterm birth
compared with EFV. However, interventions are needed to address modifiable risk
factors for preterm birth, such as nutritional status (ClinicalTrials.gov,
NCT00993031).

INTRODUCTION: Previous studies have reported a possibly increasing HIV prevalence
among men who have sex with men (MSM) in China. However there have been limited
systematic analyses of existing surveillance data to learn the trend of HIV
prevalence and factors driving the trend. The aims of this study were to examine 
the trend of HIV prevalence among MSM in Guangzhou and to explore the role of
unprotected anal intercourse (UAI) in the trend.
METHODS: Snow-ball sampling was applied in the subject recruitment for the annual
serological and behavioral surveys among MSM from 2008 to 2013. Data collected in
the behavioral survey include demographic information, HIV related sexual
behavior with men and women, access to HIV prevention services, and symptoms of
sexually transmitted infections. Chi-square test was used to analyze the trend of
HIV prevalence. Multivariate logistic regression was conducted to test the
factors associated with HIV infection.
RESULTS: HIV prevalence increased significantly from 5.0% in 2008 to 11.4% in
2013 while syphilis prevalence decreased from 17.4% to 3.3% in the same period.
UAI rates were high and stable in every single year, ranging from 54.5% to 62.0%.
Those who were having UAI (OR = 1.80, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.26-2.58),
being migrants, having more than 10 partners, and infected with syphilis had
higher risk for HIV infection.
CONCLUSIONS: HIV epidemic is expanding in Guangzhou. The persistently high UAI
may have played a major role in the increasing trend of HIV prevalence. Targeted 
prevention program should be conducted among MSM who are migrants, low
educational level, syphilis infected, or having multiple partners to encourage
HIV test and change UAI behavior. The general high UAI calls for tailored
intervention program to promote healthy culture and form a safe sex social norm
in the MSM community.

In Tanzania, the coverage of four or more antenatal care (ANC 4) visits among
pregnant women has declined over time. We conducted an exploratory analysis to
identify factors associated with utilization of ANC 4 and ANC 4 decline among
pregnant women over time. We used data from 8035 women who delivered within two
years preceding Tanzania Demographic and Health Surveys conducted in 1999,
2004/05 and 2010. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to examine
the association between all potential factors and utilization of ANC 4; and
decline in ANC 4 over time. Factors positively associated with ANC 4 utilization 
were higher quality of services, testing and counseling for HIV during ANC,
receiving two or more doses of SP (Sulphadoxine Pyrimethamine)/Fansidar for
preventing malaria during ANC and higher educational status of the woman.
Negatively associated factors were residing in a zone other than Eastern zone,
never married woman, reported long distance to health facility, first ANC visit
after four months of pregnancy and woman's desire to avoid pregnancy. The factors
significantly associated with decline in utilization of ANC 4 were: geographic
zone and age of the woman at delivery. Strategies to increase ANC 4 utilization
should focus on improvement in quality of care, geographic accessibility, early
ANC initiation, and services that allow women to avoid pregnancy. The
interconnected nature of the Tanzanian Health System is reflected in ANC 4
decline over time where introduction of new programs might have had unintended
effects on existing programs. An in-depth assessment of the recent policy change 
towards Focused Antenatal Care and its implementation across different geographic
zones, including its effect on the perception and understanding among women and
performance and counseling by health providers can help explain the decline in
ANC 4.

BACKGROUND: Dengue is not well documented in Africa. In Cameroon, data are
scarce, but dengue infection has been confirmed in humans. We conducted a study
to document risk factors associated with anti-dengue virus Immunoglobulin G
seropositivity in humans in three major towns in Cameroon.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A cross sectional survey was conducted in Douala,
Garoua and Yaounde, using a random cluster sampling design. Participants
underwent a standardized interview and were blood sampled. Environmental and
housing characteristics were recorded. Randomized houses were prospected to
record all water containers, and immature stages of Aedes mosquitoes were
collected. Sera were screened for anti-dengue virus IgG and IgM antibodies. Risk 
factors of seropositivity were tested using logistic regression methods with
random effects. Anti-dengue IgG were found from 61.4% of sera in Douala (n =
699), 24.2% in Garoua (n = 728) and 9.8% in Yaounde (n = 603). IgM were found
from 0.3% of Douala samples, 0.1% of Garoua samples and 0.0% of Yaounde samples. 
Seroneutralization on randomly selected IgG positive sera showed that 72% (n =
100) in Douala, 80% (n = 94) in Garoua and 77% (n = 66) in Yaounde had antibodies
specific for dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2). Age, temporary house walls
materials, having water-storage containers, old tires or toilets in the yard,
having no TV, having no air conditioning and having travelled at least once
outside the city were independently associated with anti-dengue IgG positivity in
Douala. Age, having uncovered water containers, having no TV, not being born in
Garoua and not breeding pigs were significant risk factors in Garoua. Recent
history of malaria, having banana trees and stagnant water in the yard were
independent risk factors in Yaounde.
CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: In this survey, most identified risk factors of dengue
were related to housing conditions. Poverty and underdevelopment are central to
the dengue epidemiology in Cameroon.

BACKGROUND: The case management of febrile children in hospitals' and health
centres' pre-roll out of the new WHO policy on parasitological diagnosis was
assessed. The delivery of artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) at these two
levels of the health system was compared.
METHODS: Structured observations and exit interviews of 1,222 febrile children
attending five hospitals and 861 attending ten health centres were conducted in
six districts of the Brong Ahafo Region of Ghana. Effectiveness of delivery of
case management of malaria was assessed. Proportions of children receiving ACT,
anti-malarial monotherapy and antibiotics were described. Predictors of: a
febrile child being given an ACT, a febrile child being given an antibiotic and
of carers knowing how to correctly administer the ACT were assessed using
logistic regression models stratified by hospitals and health centres.
RESULTS: The system's effectiveness of delivering an ACT to febrile children
diagnosed with malaria (parasitologically or clinically) was 31.4 and 42.4% in
hospitals and health centres, respectively. The most ineffective process was that
of ensuring that carers knew how to correctly administer the ACT. Overall 278
children who were not given an ACT were treated with anti-malarial monotherapy
other than quinine. The majority of these children, 232/278 were given
amodiaquine, 139 of these were children attending hospitals and 93 attending
health centres. The cadre of health staff conducting consultation was a common
predictor of the outcomes of interest. Presenting symptoms and examinations
conducted were predictive of being given an ACT in hospitals and antibiotic in
hospitals and health centres but not of being given an ACT in health centres.
Treatment-seeking factors were predictive of being given an ACT if it was more
than seven days since the fever began and an antibiotic in hospitals but not in
health centres.
CONCLUSION: Interventions to improve adherence to negative parasitological tests 
are needed, together with guidance on dispensing of antibiotics, but improving
the education of carers on how to administer ACT will lead to the greatest
immediate increase in the effectiveness of case management. Guidance is needed on
implementation of the new test-based treatment for malaria policy in health
facilities.

The relationship between maternal education and child health has intrigued
researchers for decades. This study explored the interaction between maternal
education and childhood malaria infection. Cross-sectional survey data from three
African countries were used. Descriptive analysis and multivariate logistic
regression models were completed in line with identified correlates. Marginal
effects and Oaxaca decomposition analysis on maternal education and childhood
malaria infection were also estimated. Children with mothers whose education
level was beyond primary school were 4.7% less likely to be malaria-positive (P <
0.001). The Oaxaca decomposition analysis exhibited an 8% gap in childhood
malaria infection for educated and uneducated mothers. Over 60% of the gap was
explained by differences in household wealth (26%), household place of domicile
(21%), malaria transmission intensities (14%), and media exposure (12%). All
other correlates accounted for only 27%. The full adjusted model showed a robust 
and significant relationship between maternal education and childhood malaria
infection.

BACKGROUND: After years of implementing Roll Back Malaria (RBM) interventions,
the changing landscape of malaria in terms of risk factors and spatial pattern
has not been fully investigated. This paper uses the 2010 malaria indicator
survey data to investigate if known malaria risk factors remain relevant after
many years of interventions.
METHODS: We adopted a structured additive logistic regression model that allowed 
for spatial correlation, to more realistically estimate malaria risk factors. Our
model included child and household level covariates, as well as climatic and
environmental factors. Continuous variables were modelled by assuming second
order random walk priors, while spatial correlation was specified as a Markov
random field prior, with fixed effects assigned diffuse priors. Inference was
fully Bayesian resulting in an under five malaria risk map for Malawi.
RESULTS: Malaria risk increased with increasing age of the child. With respect to
socio-economic factors, the greater the household wealth, the lower the malaria
prevalence. A general decline in malaria risk was observed as altitude increased.
Minimum temperatures and average total rainfall in the three months preceding the
survey did not show a strong association with disease risk.
CONCLUSIONS: The structured additive regression model offered a flexible
extension to standard regression models by enabling simultaneous modelling of
possible nonlinear effects of continuous covariates, spatial correlation and
heterogeneity, while estimating usual fixed effects of categorical and continuous
observed variables. Our results confirmed that malaria epidemiology is a complex 
interaction of biotic and abiotic factors, both at the individual, household and 
community level and that risk factors are still relevant many years after
extensive implementation of RBM activities.

Intestinal parasitic infections among prison inmates and tobacco farm workers in 
Shewa Robit, north-central Ethiopia.

Sciences, Addis Ababa University, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

BACKGROUND: Intestinal parasitic infections (IPIs) particularly soil-transmitted 
helminthiasis (STH) and schistosomiasis are among neglected tropical diseases
(NTDs) globally. Apart from being associated with anemia, malabsorption and
retarded cognitive development these diseases are complicating the clinical
picture of more serious infections like HIV, TB and malaria. Renewed and
up-to-date information on the epidemiology of IPIs in more vulnerable groups such
as irrigated-farm workers and prisoners would significantly contribute towards
improving the health condition of such at-risk groups.
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted to determine the prevalence of
IPIs among prison inmates and tobacco farm workers in Shewa-Robit, north-central 
Ethiopia in November 2008. A total of 236 fecal samples were examined
microscopically to detect helminths and/or protozoa using direct-smear and
formol-ether concentration methods.
RESULTS: Overall, 8 intestinal parasite species have been recovered singly or in 
combinations from 146 (61.8 %) samples. The prevalence in prison population
(88/121 = 72.7%) was significantly higher than that in tobacco farm (58/115 =
50.4%). There were no significant differences in the prevalence of IPI by most
socio-demographics. Except for hookworm there was no significant difference in
parasite prevalence between different age-groups though the frequency of
individual parasites slightly varied between the age-groups. Multivariate
logistic regression analysis showed that inmates were more likely to acquire IPIs
than tobacco-farm workers (Odds Ratio (OR) = 2.62, 95% confidence interval (CI) =
1.52-4.5). In addition, participants who did not report past treatment for IPIs
were more likely to acquire IPIs than participants who self-reported treatment
for IPIs in the past twelve months (OR = 3.25, 95% CI = 1.75-6.06). All other
socio-demographics were not significantly associated with IPIs in univariate
analysis. Entamoeba histolytica/dispar/moshkovskii was the most frequently
encountered species in both study sites accounting for 48.8 and 51.7 percent of
the positives in prison and tobacco farm population respectively. Other
intestinal parasites detected, with slight variation in prevalence in the two
study areas, were hookworm, Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura,
Schistosoma mansoni, Strongyloides stercolaris, Hymenolepis nana and Taenia sp.
35.5 and 33.0 percent of the total positive cases were mixed infections in Shewa 
Robit prison and tobacco farm, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The results show that IPIs are common health problems in the studied 
populations.

BACKGROUND: Predictive models of malaria vector larval habitat locations may
provide a basis for understanding the spatial determinants of malaria
transmission.
METHODS: We used four landscape variables (topographic wetness index [TWI], soil 
type, land use-land cover, and distance to stream) and accumulated precipitation 
to model larval habitat locations in a region of western Kenya through two
methods: logistic regression and random forest. Additionally, we used two
separate data sets to account for variation in habitat locations across space and
over time.
RESULTS: Larval habitats were more likely to be present in locations with a lower
slope to contributing area ratio (i.e. TWI), closer to streams, with agricultural
land use relative to nonagricultural land use, and in friable clay/sandy clay
loam soil and firm, silty clay/clay soil relative to friable clay soil. The
probability of larval habitat presence increased with increasing accumulated
precipitation. The random forest models were more accurate than the logistic
regression models, especially when accumulated precipitation was included to
account for seasonal differences in precipitation. The most accurate models for
the two data sets had area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.864 and 0.871,
respectively. TWI, distance to the nearest stream, and precipitation had the
greatest mean decrease in Gini impurity criteria in these models.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the usefulness of random forest models for
larval malaria vector habitat modeling. TWI and distance to the nearest stream
were the two most important landscape variables in these models. Including
accumulated precipitation in our models improved the accuracy of larval habitat
location predictions by accounting for seasonal variation in the precipitation.
Finally, the sampling strategy employed here for model parameterization could
serve as a framework for creating predictive larval habitat models to assist in
larval control efforts.

Education and knowledge helps combating malaria, but not degedege: a
cross-sectional study in Rufiji, Tanzania.

BACKGROUND: Traditional medicine is readily available in Tanzania, and local
terms like degedege is widely used for malaria-like illnesses, often associated
with supernatural forces. Malaria prevention and intervention efforts can benefit
from policy-makers' awareness of local perceptions and beliefs in the rural areas
affected by malaria. This study measured knowledge, attitudes and behaviour
towards malaria and malaria-like illnesses.
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in a rural area in Rufiji,
Tanzania. A case report form employing a scoring system was used to capture
participants' knowledge of malaria and another for preventive actions against
malaria. Logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with knowledge
and preventive action.
RESULTS: Most of the participants possessed good knowledge about malaria
transmission (82.1%), prevention (85.2%) and where to get treatment (96.4%).
Fewer were familiar with fever (58.2%) and other common symptoms of malaria
(32.7%), and even fewer actually put their knowledge into action. The action
score measured the use of bed net, treatment of nets, indoor use of insecticide
residual spraying (IRS), and proportion of households with tight windows, among
the participants. As many as 35.7% scored zero on preventive actions, while 37.2%
achieved a high action score. Education level and belonging to the age group 30
to 49 were significantly associated with higher knowledge. Education level was
associated with higher score for preventive action (OR 2.3, CI 95% 1.2-1.4).
Participants generally perceived degedege, a local name for an illness with
convulsion, as different from malaria both with regards to cause and possible
preventive and curative interventions.
CONCLUSION: Respondents considered degedege to have supernatural causes and to
need treatment by a traditional healer. This may be one reason for care-seeking
shopping and care-seeking delay. Regarding degedege as a separate entity may
explain why malaria is not perceived as a serious health problem in the area, and
why little preventive actions are taken. While the elders have high status in the
society, their lack of knowledge of malaria may impact the care-seeking pattern
of their families.

BACKGROUND: Pregnancy is a known risk factor for malaria which is associated with
increased maternal and infant mortality and morbidity in areas of moderate-high
malaria transmission intensity where Plasmodium falciparum predominates. The
nature and impact of malaria, however, is not well understood in pregnant women
residing in areas of low, unstable malaria transmission where P. falciparum and
P. vivax co-exist.
METHODS: A large longitudinal active surveillance study of malaria was conducted 
in the Chittagong Hill Districts of Bangladesh. Over 32 months in 2010-2013, the 
period prevalence of asymptomatic P. falciparum infections was assessed by rapid 
diagnostic test and blood smear and compared among men, non-pregnant women and
pregnant women. A subset of samples was tested for infection by PCR. Hemoglobin
was assessed. Independent risk factors for malaria infection were determined
using a multivariate logistic regression model.
RESULTS: Total of 34 asymptomatic P. falciparum infections were detected by
RDT/smear from 3,110 tests. The period prevalence of asymptomatic P. falciparum
infection in pregnant women was 2.3%, compared to 0.5% in non-pregnant women and 
0.9% in men. All RDT/smear positive samples that were tested by PCR were
PCR-positive, and PCR detected additional 35 infections that were RDT/smear
negative. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, pregnant women had
5.4-fold higher odds of infection as compared to non-pregnant women.
Malaria-positive pregnant women, though asymptomatic, had statistically lower
hemoglobin than those without malaria or pregnancy. Asymptomatic malaria was
found to be evenly distributed across space and time, in contrast to symptomatic 
infections which tend to cluster.
CONCLUSION: Pregnancy is a risk factor for asymptomatic P. falciparum infection
in the Chittagong Hill Districts of Bangladesh, and pregnancy and malaria
interact to heighten the effect of each on hemoglobin. The even distribution of
asymptomatic malaria, without temporal and spatial clustering, may have critical 
implications for malaria elimination strategies.

Background. Malaria during pregnancy is a major public health problem in Nigeria 
especially in malaria-endemic areas. It increases the risk of low birth weight
and child/maternal morbidity/mortality. This paper addresses the impact of radio 
campaigns on the use of insecticide-treated bed nets among pregnant women in
Nigeria. Methods. A total of 2,348 pregnant women were interviewed during the
survey across 21 of Nigeria's 36 states. Respondents were selected through a
multistage sampling technique. Analysis was based on multivariate logistic
regression. Results. Respondents who knew that sleeping under ITN prevents
malaria were 3.2 times more likely to sleep under net (OR: 3.15; 95% CI: 2.28 to 
4.33; P < 0.0001). Those who listened to radio are also about 1.6 times more
likely to use ITN (OR: 1.56; 95% CI: 1.07 to 2.28; P = 0.020), while respondents 
who had heard of a specific sponsored radio campaign on ITN are 1.53 times more
likely to use a bed net (P = 0.019). Conclusion. Pregnant women who listened to
mass media campaigns were more likely to adopt strategies to protect themselves
from malaria. Therefore, behavior change communication messages that are aimed at
promoting net use and antenatal attendance are necessary in combating malaria.

Prevalence of malaria and anaemia among HIV infected pregnant women receiving
co-trimoxazole prophylaxis in Tanzania: a cross sectional study in Kinondoni
Municipality.

Allied Sciences, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania. minziobejayesu@gmail.com.

BACKGROUND: HIV-infected pregnant women are particularly more susceptible to the 
deleterious effects of malaria infection particularly anaemia. In order to
prevent opportunistic infections and malaria, a policy of daily co-trimoxazole
prophylaxis without the standard Suphadoxine-Pyrimethamine intermittent
preventive treatment (SP-IPT) was introduced to all HIV infected pregnant women
in the year 2011. However, there is limited information about the effectiveness
of this policy.
METHODS: This was a cross sectional study conducted among HIV-infected pregnant
women receiving co-trimoxazole prophylaxis in eight public health facilities in
Kinondoni Municipality from February to April 2013. Blood was tested for malaria 
infection and anaemia (haemoglobin <11 g/dl). Data were collected on the
adherence to co-trimoxazole prophylaxis and other risk factors for malaria
infection and anaemia. Pearson chi-square test, Fischer's exact test and
multivariate logistic regression were used in the statistical analysis.
RESULTS: This study enrolled 420 HIV infected pregnant women. The prevalence of
malaria infection was 4.5%, while that of anaemia was 54%. The proportion of
subjects with poor adherence to co-trimoxazole was 50.5%. As compared to HIV
infected pregnant women with good adherence to co-trimoxazole prophylaxis, the
poor adherents were more likely to have a malaria infection (Adjusted Odds Ratio,
AOR = 6.81, 95% CI = 1.35-34.43, P = 0.02) or anaemia (AOR = 1.75, 95%
CI = 1.03-2.98, P = 0.039). Other risk factors associated with anaemia were
advanced WHO clinical stages, current malaria infection and history of episodes
of malaria illness during the index pregnancy.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of malaria was low; however, a significant proportion 
of subjects had anaemia. Good adherence to co-trimoxazole prophylaxis was
associated with reduction of both malaria infection and anaemia among HIV
infected pregnant women.

Viral CNS infections in children from a malaria-endemic area of Malawi: a
prospective cohort study.

Comment in
    Lancet Glob Health. 2013 Sep;1(3):e121-2.

BACKGROUND: Fever with reduced consciousness is an important cause of hospital
admission of children in sub-Saharan Africa, with high mortality. Cerebral
malaria, diagnosed when acute Plasmodium falciparum infection and coma are
recorded with no other apparent reason, is one important cause. We investigated
whether viruses could also be an important cause of CNS infection in such
patients, and examined the relative contribution of viral pathogens and malaria
parasitaemia.
METHODS: We did a prospective cohort study in Blantyre, Malawi. From March 1,
2002, to Aug 31, 2004, we enrolled children aged between 2 months and 15 years
who were admitted to hospital with suspected non-bacterial CNS infections.
Children with a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) white cell count of less than 1000
cells per μL and negative bacterial microscopy and culture were deemed to have
suspected viral CNS infection. Blood was examined for asexual forms of P
falciparum. PCR was done on CSF or on post-mortem brain biopsy specimens to
detect 15 viruses known to cause CNS infection.
FINDINGS: Full outcome data were available for 513 children with suspected viral 
CNS infection, of whom 94 (18%) died. 163 children (32%) had P falciparum
parasitaemia, of whom 34 (21%) died. At least one virus was detected in the CNS
in 133 children (26%), of whom 43 (33%) died. 12 different viruses were detected;
adenovirus was the most common, affecting 42 children; mumps, human herpes virus 
6, rabies, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus 1, and enterovirus were also
important. 45 (9%) of the 513 children had both parasitaemia and viral infection,
including 27 (35%) of 78 diagnosed clinically with cerebral malaria. Children
with dual infection were more likely to have seizures than were those with
parasitaemia alone, viral infection only, or neither (p<0·0001). 17 (38%) of the 
45 children with dual infection died, compared with 26 (30%) of 88 with viral
infection only, 17 (14%) of 118 with parasitaemia only, and 34 (13%) of 262 with 
neither (p<0·0001). Logistic regression showed children with a viral CNS
infection had a significantly higher mortality than did those who did not have a 
viral CNS infection (p=0·001).
INTERPRETATION: Viral CNS infections are an important cause of hospital admission
and death in children in Malawi, including in children whose coma might be
attributed solely to cerebral malaria. Interaction between viral infection and
parasitaemia could increase disease severity.

BACKGROUND: In 2010, the World Health Organization revised guidelines to
recommend diagnosis of all suspected malaria cases prior to treatment. There has 
been no systematic assessment of malaria test uptake for pediatric fevers at the 
population level as countries start implementing guidelines. We examined test use
for pediatric fevers in relation to malaria endemicity and treatment-seeking
behavior in multiple sub-Saharan African countries in initial years of
implementation.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We compiled data from national population-based surveys
reporting fever prevalence, care-seeking and diagnostic use for children under
five years in 13 sub-Saharan African countries in 2009-2011/12 (n = 105,791).
Mixed-effects logistic regression models quantified the influence of source of
care and malaria endemicity on test use after adjusting for socioeconomic
covariates. Results were stratified by malaria endemicity categories: low
(PfPR2-10<5%), moderate (PfPR2-10 5-40%), high (PfPR2-10>40%). Among febrile
under-fives surveyed, 16.9% (95% CI: 11.8%-21.9%) were tested. Compared to
hospitals, febrile children attending non-hospital sources (OR: 0.62, 95% CI:
0.56-0.69) and community health workers (OR: 0.31, 95% CI: 0.23-0.43) were less
often tested. Febrile children in high-risk areas had reduced odds of testing
compared to low-risk settings (OR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.42-0.62). Febrile children in 
least poor households were more often tested than in poorest (OR: 1.63, 95% CI:
1.39-1.91), as were children with better-educated mothers compared to least
educated (OR: 1.33, 95% CI: 1.16-1.54).
CONCLUSIONS: Diagnostic testing of pediatric fevers was low and inequitable at
the outset of new guidelines. Greater testing is needed at lower or less formal
sources where pediatric fevers are commonly managed, particularly to reach the
poorest. Lower test uptake in high-risk settings merits further investigation
given potential implications for diagnostic scale-up in these areas. Findings
could inform continued implementation of new guidelines to improve access to and

HIV-syphilis co-infection is often cited as a major reason behind recent
resurgence in syphilis prevalence among men who have sex with men in China. Most 
published literatures explore factors associated with either HIV or syphilis, but
not their co-infection. We analysed data from a cross-sectional survey on men who
have sex with men in seven Chinese cities. Snowball sampling was used to recruit 
participants for the survey. Socio-demographic and behavioural predictors for
HIV-syphilis mono/co-infection were examined using ordinal logistic regression.
Factor scores were used to summarise (1) HIV-related knowledge and (2) access to 
HIV preventive services. Prevalence of HIV, syphilis, and their co-infection,
among 2936 self-identified men who have sex with men, were 7.7%, 14.3%, and 2.6%,
respectively. In the adjusted analysis, the significant positive correlates of
poorer diagnoses (co-infection vs mono- and no infection or co- and
mono-infection vs no infection) were: 30 to 39 years and ≥40 years age, education
up to senior high school, unprotected anal intercourse, recent sexually
transmitted infection symptoms, incorrect knowledge about routes of transmission,
and access to preventive or counselling/testing services for HIV. For effective
control of this dual epidemic, integrated HIV and syphilis surveillance and
targeted intervention strategies for Chinese men who have sex with men are needed
urgently.

BACKGROUND: Throughout Africa, many people seek care for malaria in
private-sector drug shops where diagnostic testing is often unavailable.
Recently, subsidized artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), a first-line
medication for uncomplicated malaria, were made available in these drug shops in 
Tanzania. This study assessed the prevalence of malaria among and purchase of
ACTs by drug shop clients in the setting of a national ACT subsidy program and
sub-national drug shop accreditation program.
METHOD AND FINDINGS: A cross-sectional survey of drug shop clients was performed 
in two regions in Tanzania, one with a government drug shop accreditation program
and one without, from March-May, 2012. Drug shops were randomly sampled from
non-urban districts. Shop attendants were interviewed about their education,
training, and accreditation status. Clients were interviewed about their symptoms
and medication purchases, then underwent a limited physical examination and
laboratory testing for malaria. Malaria prevalence and predictors of ACT purchase
were assessed using univariate analysis and multiple logistic regression. Amongst
777 clients from 73 drug shops, the prevalence of laboratory-confirmed malaria
was 12% (95% CI: 6-18%). Less than a third of clients with malaria had purchased 
ACTs, and less than a quarter of clients who purchased ACTs tested positive for
malaria. Clients were more likely to have purchased ACTs if the participant was
<5 years old (aOR: 6.6; 95% CI: 3.9-11.0) or the shop attendant had >5 years,
experience (aOR: 2.8; 95% CI: 1.2-6.3). Having malaria was only a predictor of
ACT purchase in the region with a drug shop accreditation program (aOR: 3.4; 95% 
CI: 1.5-7.4).
CONCLUSION: Malaria is common amongst persons presenting to drug shops with a
complaint of fever. The low proportion of persons with malaria purchasing ACTs,
and the high proportion of ACTs going to persons without malaria demonstrates a
need to better target who receives ACTs in these drug shops.

OBJECTIVE: To assess anemia prevalence and identify associated parameters in
children <3 years of age in a rural area of Ghana.
METHOD: Univariate and multivariate logistic regression of cross-sectional survey
results from 861 children aged <3 years attending routine immunization services
in Berekum district.
RESULTS: Anemia prevalence was 73.1%; most were either mildly (31.2%) or
moderately (38.7%) affected. Risk factors for anemia (hemoglobin < 11.0 g/dl) in 
multivariate analysis were malaria parasitemia and male sex; these factors and
younger age were associated with anemia severity. A partial defect in
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase was associated with decreased severity.
Height-for-age, but not weight-for-age, was associated with anemia and its
severity.
CONCLUSIONS: Malaria parasitemia was strongly associated with anemia and its
severity, suggesting that malaria control may be the most effective way to reduce
the burden of anemia in rural Ghanaian children.

BACKGROUND: In Europe, a continuous programme (SPREAD) has been in place for ten 
years to study transmission of drug resistant HIV. We analysed time trends of
transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) in relation to the risk behaviour
reported.
METHODS: HIV-1 patients newly diagnosed in 27 countries from 2002 through 2007
were included. Inclusion was representative for risk group and geographical
distribution in the participating countries in Europe. Trends over time were
calculated by logistic regression.
RESULTS: From the 4317 patients included, the majority was
men-having-sex-with-men -MSM (2084, 48%), followed by heterosexuals (1501, 35%)
and injection drug users (IDU) (355, 8%). MSM were more often from Western Europe
origin, infected with subtype B virus, and recently infected (<1 year) (p<0.001).
The prevalence of TDRM was highest in MSM (prevalence of 11.1%), followed by
heterosexuals (6.6%) and IDU (5.1%, p<0.001). TDRM was predominantly ascribed to 
nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) with a prevalence of 6.6% in
MSM, 3.3% in heterosexuals and 2.0% in IDU (p = 0.001). A significant increase in
resistance to non- nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) and a
decrease in resistance to protease inhibitors was observed in MSM (p = 0.008 and 
p = 0.006, respectively), but not in heterosexual patients (p = 0.68 and
p = 0.14, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: MSM showed to have significantly higher TDRM prevalence compared to 
heterosexuals and IDU. The increasing NNRTI resistance in MSM is likely to
negatively influence the therapy response of first-line therapy, as most include 
NNRTI drugs.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to describe the morbidity and mortality patterns in
HIV-positive adults hospitalized in West Africa.
METHOD: We conducted a six-month prospective multicentre survey within the IeDEA 
West Africa collaboration in six adult medical wards of teaching hospitals in
Abidjan, Ouagadougou, Cotonou, Dakar and Bamako. From April to October 2010, all 
newly hospitalized HIV-positive patients were eligible. Baseline and follow-up
information until hospital discharge was recorded using standardized forms.
Diagnoses were reviewed by a local event validation committee using reference
definitions. Factors associated with in-hospital mortality were studied with a
logistic regression model.
RESULTS: Among 823 hospitalized HIV-positive adults (median age 40 years, 58%
women), 24% discovered their HIV infection during the hospitalization, median CD4
count was 75/mm(3) (IQR: 25-177) and 48% had previously received antiretroviral
treatment (ART). The underlying causes of hospitalization were AIDS-defining
conditions (54%), other infections (32%), other diseases (8%) and non-specific
illness (6%). The most frequent diseases diagnosed were: tuberculosis (29%),
pneumonia (15%), malaria (10%) and cerebral toxoplasmosis (10%). Overall, 315
(38%) patients died during hospitalization and the underlying cause of death was 
AIDS (63%), non-AIDS-defining infections (26%), other diseases (7%) and
non-specific illness or unknown cause (4%). Among them, the most frequent fatal
diseases were: tuberculosis (36%), cerebral toxoplasmosis (10%), cryptococcosis
(9%) and sepsis (7%). Older age, clinical WHO stage 3 and 4, low CD4 count, and
AIDS-defining infectious diagnoses were associated with hospital fatality.
CONCLUSIONS: AIDS-defining conditions, primarily tuberculosis, and bacterial
infections were the most frequent causes of hospitalization in HIV-positive
adults in West Africa and resulted in high in-hospital fatality. Sustained
efforts are needed to integrate care of these disease conditions and optimize
earlier diagnosis of HIV infection and initiation of ART.

Impact of malaria related messages on insecticide-treated net (ITN) use for
malaria prevention in Ghana.

Association with the Harvard School of Public Health, Cyprus University of
Technology, Limassol, Cyprus. suseadjah@yahoo.co.uk.

BACKGROUND: Media messages have been used in Ghana to promote insecticide-treated
net (ITN)/bed net usage in an effort to impact on malaria prevention. The aim of 
this study was to assess the effect of such malaria-related messages delivered
through electronic/print media and by volunteers/health workers on the use of
ITNs by children living in a household.
METHODS: Data was collected from September to November of 2008 using a
structured, interviewer-administered questionnaire by the Ghana Statistical
Service as part of a national demographic and health survey (DHS). Secondary data
analysis was performed on the collected data using multivariate logistic
regression for both individual messages and a composite (any of) message
variable.
RESULTS: From the 11,788 households surveyed, 45% had at least one net.
Households with male heads were more likely to have a child sleeping under a bed 
net the previous night (p = 0.0001). Individual Messages delivered by a health
worker or a dedicated radio programme, had the highest effect for one or more
children sleeping under a net the night before (OR(adjusted) = 1.65; 95% CI =
1.44 to 1.88 and OR(adjusted) = 1.26; 95% CI =1.12 to 1.42 respectively) while
hearing any of the eight messages (composite score) resulted in the highest odds 
for one or more children (OR(adjusted) = 3.06; 95% CI = 2.27 to 4.12) sleeping
under a bed net.
CONCLUSION: Efforts to relate ITN messages to the public are very useful in
increasing use of bed nets and having multiple ways of reaching the public
increases their effect, with the biggest effect seen when health workers and
volunteers were used to deliver malaria-related messages to the public.

BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1(PfEMP1) is a
family of variant surface antigens (VSA) that mediate the adhesion of parasite
infected erythrocytes to capillary endothelial cells within host tissues. Opinion
is divided over the role of PfEMP1 in the widespread endothelial activation
associated with severe malaria. In a previous study we found evidence for
differential associations between defined VSA subsets and specific syndromes of
severe malaria: group A-like PfEMP1 expression and the "rosetting" phenotype were
associated with impaired consciousness and respiratory distress, respectively.
This study explores the involvement of widespread endothelial activation in these
associations.
METHODS: We used plasma angiopoietin-2 as a marker of widespread endothelial
activation. Using logistic regression analysis, we explored the relationships
between plasma angiopoietin-2 levels, parasite VSA expression and the two
syndromes of severe malaria, impaired consciousness and respiratory distress.
RESULTS: Plasma angiopoietin-2 was associated with both syndromes. The rosetting 
phenotype did not show an independent association with respiratory distress when 
adjusted for angiopoietin-2, consistent with a single pathogenic mechanism
involving widespread endothelial activation. In contrast, group A-like PfEMP1
expression and angiopoietin-2 maintained independent associations with impaired
consciousness when adjusted for each other.
CONCLUSION: The results are consistent with multiple pathogenic mechanisms
leading to severe malaria and heterogeneity in the pathophysiology of impaired
consciousness. The observed association between group A-like PfEMP1 and impaired 
consciousness does not appear to involve widespread endothelial activation.

BACKGROUND: Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) is the recommended
first-line therapy for uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria worldwide but 
decreased artemisinin susceptibility, phenotypically characterized as slow
parasite clearance time (PCT), has now been reported in Southeast Asia. This
makes it all too important to measure the dynamics of parasite clearance in
African patients treated with ACT over time, to understand trends and detect
changes early enough to intervene
METHODS: Individual patient data from 27 clinical trials of
artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ) vs comparators conducted between 1999 and 2009 were
analysed for parasite clearance on modified intent-to-treat (ITT) basis.
RESULTS: Overall 15,017 patients treated for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria 
at 44 sites in 20 sub-Saharan African countries were included in the analysis;
51% (n=7,660) vs 49% (n=7,357) were treated with ASAQ and comparator treatments, 
respectively. Seventy-seven per cent (77%) were children under six years of age. 
The proportion of the patients treated with ASAQ with persistent parasitaemia on 
Day 2 was 8.6%, and 1.5% on Day 3. Risk factor for not clearing parasites on Day 
2 and Day 3 calculated by multivariate logistic regression with random effect on 
site and controlling for treatment were: high parasitaemia before treatment was
(adjusted risk ratios (AOR) 2.12, 95% CI 1.91-2.35, AOR 2.43, 95% CI 1.98-3.00,
respectively); non-ACT treatment (p=0.001, for all comparisons). Anaemia
(p=0.001) was an additional factor for Day 2 and young age (p=0.005) for Day 3.In
patients treated with ASAQ in studies who had complete parasitaemia data every 24
hours up to Day 3 and additionally Day 7, the parasite reduction ratio was 93.9% 
by Day 1 and 99.9% by Day 2. Using the median parasitaemia before treatment
(p0=27,125 μL) and a fitted model, the predicted PCT (pPCT = 3.614*ln (p0) -
6.135, r(2) = 0.94) in ASAQ recipients was 31 hours.
CONCLUSION: Within the period covered by these studies, rapid Plasmodium
falciparum clearance continues to be achieved in Sub-Saharan African patients
treated with ACT, and in particular with ASAQ. The prediction formula for
parasite clearance time could be a pragmatic tool for studies with binary
outcomes and once-daily sampling, both for research and monitoring purposes.

BACKGROUND: WHO recommends intermittent-preventive-treatment (IPTp) with
sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) and insecticide-treated-nets (ITNs) to prevent
malaria in pregnancy in sub-Saharan Africa, however uptake remains unacceptably
low. We evaluated the effectiveness of antenatal clinics (ANC) to deliver two
doses of IPTp and ITNs to pregnant women in Segou district, Mali.
METHODS: We used household data to assess the systems effectiveness of ANC to
deliver IPTp and ITNs to pregnant women and used logistic regression to identify 
predictors of ANC attendance, receipt of IPTp and ITN use during pregnancy, and
the impact on community effectiveness.
RESULTS: Of 81% of recently pregnant women who made at least one ANC visit, 59%
of these attended during the eligible gestational age for IPTp. Of these, 82%
reported receiving one dose of SP and 91% attended ANC again, of whom 66%
received a second dose, resulting in a cumulative effectiveness for 2-dose IPTp
of 29%, most of whom used an ITN (90%). Cumulative effectiveness of 2-dose SP by 
directly observed therapy (DOT) was very low (6%). ITN use was 92%, and ANC was
the main source (81%). Reported and ANC-card data showed some doses of SP are
given to women in their first trimester. Women were less likely to receive two
doses by DOT if they were married (OR 0.10; CI 0.03, 0.40), or lived <5 km from
the health facility (OR 0.34; CI 0.14, 0.83). A high household person-LLIN ratio 
predicted low ITN use in pregnant women (OR 0.16; CI 0.04, 0.55).
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest poor adherence by health workers to provision of
IPTp by eligible gestational age and DOT, contributing to low effectiveness of
this strategy in this setting. ITN delivery and use among women was substantially
higher. Efforts to improve health worker adherence to IPTp guidelines are needed 
to improve service delivery of IPTp.

INTRODUCTION: Anaemia among children is a public health issue in Ghana. The Ghana
School Feeding Programme (GSFP) was instituted on pilot basis in an effort to
provide nutritious lunch to school children. Evidence on the nutritional status
of pupils is needed to inform the expansion of GSFP. This study sought to assess 
anaemia among Ghanaian pupils.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study involved a random sample of 143 pupils aged 6
to 12 years. Blood samples were collected and analysed for serum-ferritin (SF),
C-reactive protein (CRP), haemoglobin and malaria-parasitaemia (MP). Stool
samples were examined for soil-transmitted helminths. Dietary data were collected
using the 24 hour-recall method on three non-consecutive days and a food
frequency questionnaire. The Student's t-test was used to compare mean values
between sexes. Binary logistic regression was performed to identify factors
associated with anaemia. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.
RESULTS: SF and haemoglobin concentrations were 23.9 ± 15 ng/ml and 120 ± 11 g/L 
respectively. The prevalence of anaemia was 30.8%. More females (41.5%) than
males (21.8%) had anaemia (p < 0.005). Seventy-one percent of pupils had low SF
levels. MP prevalence was 67.8%. Hookworm infestation was only observed in males 
(18.0%). Dietary iron and vitamin C intakes were 18.98 ± 8.8 mg and 23.7 ± 6.7
mg, respectively. Child's sex, SF and MP were associated with anaemia. Males had 
a lower likelihood of being anaemic (OR = 0.2, CI 0.1-0.5, p = 0.002).
CONCLUSION: The study findings underscore the need for multi-pronged approaches
that address both malaria control and nutrition in order to reduce anaemia among 
pupils.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the proportion of severe maternal outcomes resulting from
indirect causes, and to determine pregnancy outcomes of women with indirect
causes.
DESIGN: Secondary analysis of the WHO Multicountry Survey on Maternal and Newborn
Health.
SETTING: A total of 359 health facilities in 29 countries in Africa, Asia, Latin 
America, and the Middle East.
SAMPLE: A total of 314 623 pregnant women admitted to the participating
facilities.
METHODS: We identified the percentage of women with severe maternal outcomes
arising from indirect causes. We evaluated the risk of severe maternal and
perinatal outcomes in women with, versus without, underlying indirect causes,
using adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals, by a multilevel,
multivariate logistic regression model, accounting for clustering effects within 
countries and health facilities.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Severe maternal outcomes and preterm birth, fetal
mortality, early neonatal mortality, perinatal mortality, low birthweight, and
neonatal intensive care unit admission.
RESULTS: Amongst 314 623 included women, 2822 were reported to suffer from severe
maternal outcomes, out of which 20.9% (589/2822; 95% CI 20.1-21.6%) were
associated with indirect causes. The most common indirect cause was anaemia
(50%). Women with underlying indirect causes showed significantly higher risk of 
obstetric complications (adjusted odds ratio, aOR, 7.0; 95% CI 6.6-7.4), severe
maternal outcomes (aOR 27.9; 95% CI 24.7-31.6), and perinatal mortality (aOR 3.8;
95% CI 3.5-4.1).
CONCLUSIONS: Indirect causes were responsible for about one-fifth of severe
maternal outcomes. Women with underlying indirect causes had significantly
increased risks of severe maternal and perinatal outcomes.

Anemia is a significant risk factor for poor health outcomes for both the mother 
and neonate; however, the determinants of anemia in many epidemiological settings
are poorly understood. Using a subset of a nationally representative cluster
survey (2010 Demographic and Health Survey) in combination with other
non-contemporaneous survey data, the epidemiology of anemia among women of
reproductive age in Timor-Leste has been explored. Logistic regression was used
to identify risk factors, population-level impacts were estimated as population
attributable fractions and spatial analytics were used to identify regions of
highest risk. The DHS survey found that ∼ 21% of adult women in Timor-Leste are
anemic (49,053; 95% CI: 37,095 to 61,035), with hemoglobin <12.0 g/dL. In this
population, the main risk factors (adjusted odds ratio; 95% CI) are: currently
abstaining from sex for any reason (2.25; 1.50 to 3.38); illiteracy (2.04; 1.49
to 2.80); giving birth within the previous year (1.80; 1.29 to 2.51); consumption
of fruits/vegetables low in vitamin A (1.57; 1.13 to 2.20); and the
district-level confirmed malaria incidence (1.31; 1.15 to 1.49). A review of
prior soil-transmitted helminth surveys in Timor-Leste indicates low-to-moderate 
prevalence with generally low egg counts, suggesting a limited impact on anemia
in this setting, although comprehensive survey data are lacking. Examination of
the population-level effects highlights the impacts of both recent births and
malaria on anemia, with more limited impacts from diet; the evidence does not
suggest a large contribution from geohelminths within Timor-Leste. These patterns
are divergent from some other settings in the Asia-Pacific region and highlight
the need for further focused research. Targeting high-burden districts and by
increasing access to pre/postnatal care, raising literacy levels, increasing
access to family planning, and improving malaria control should be prioritized to
maximize inherently limited health budgets in reaching these populations.

BACKGROUND: Assessment of risk factors for preterm birth in a population with
high incidence of preterm birth and HIV infection.
METHODS: Secondary analysis of data for 2,149 women included in a community based
randomized placebo controlled trial for the prevention of preterm birth (APPLe
trial (ISRCTN84023116) with gestational age at birth determined through
ultrasound measurement in early pregnancy. Multivariate Logistic Regression
analyses to obtain models for three outcome variables: all preterm, early
preterm, and late preterm birth.
FINDINGS: No statistical differences were noted for the prevalence of HIV
infection (p = 0.30) or syphilis (p = 0.12) between women who delivered preterm
versus term. BMI (Adjusted OR 0.91 (0.85-0.97); p = 0.005) and weight gain
(Adjusted OR 0.89 (0.82-0.97); p = 0.006) had an independent, protective effect. 
Previous preterm birth doubled the odds of preterm birth (Adjusted OR 2.13
(1.198-3.80); p = 0.01). Persistent malaria (despite malaria prophylaxis)
increased the risk of late preterm birth (Adjusted OR 1.99 (1.05-3.79);
p = 0.04). Age <20 (Adjusted OR 1.73 (1.03-2.90); p = 0.04) and anemia (Adjusted 
OR 1.95 (1.08-3.52); p = 0.03) were associated with early preterm birth (<34
weeks).
CONCLUSIONS: Despite claims that HIV infection is an important cause of preterm
birth in Africa, we found no evidence of an association in this population
(unexposed to anti-retroviral treatment). Persistent malaria was associated with 
late preterm birth. Maternal undernourishment and anemia were independently
associated with early preterm birth. The study did not assess whether the link
was direct or whether a common precursor such as chronic infection was
responsible for both maternal effects and early labour.

BACKGROUND: Understanding the feasibility of achieving widespread coverage with
Insecticide-Treated Nets has to be preceded by learning how people value the
Insecticide-Treated Nets and estimating the potential demand and willingness to
pay so that sustainability of the intervention can be assured. The objective of
this study was to determine willingness to pay for Insecticide-Treated Nets among
households in Berehet District, Northern Ethiopia.
METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted using both
quantitative and qualitative methods in five randomly selected Kebeles from
January-February 2012. Open ended contingent valuation technique with follow-up
method was used. Qualitative data were collected through focus group discussions 
and observation methods. Binary logistic regression was used to determine the
association between dependent and independent variables.
RESULTS: The average number of individuals per Insecticide-Treated Nets was 3.83.
Nearly 68.5% persons had willingness to buy Insecticide-Treated Nets if they have
access to these Nets. The median maximum price a person is willingness to pay for
blue rectangular Insecticide-Treated Net was 20 ETB. People had willingness to
pay 30 ETB for blue and white conical insecticide-treated nets. Working on
knowledge of malaria (OR=0.68, CI (0.47, 0.98; p<0.05), perceived benefit of
Insecticide-Treated Nets (OR=0.28, CI (0.2-0.4; p<0.05), perceived susceptibility
(OR=0.64(0.44-0.93; p<0.05) and perceived severity of malaria (OR=0.65(0.47-0.91,
p<0.05) had significant association with a willingness to pay Insecticide-Treated
Nets. Respondents who prefer Kebele/place/ to buy Insecticide-Treated Net for
rectangular shape had a significant association with a willingness to pay for
Insecticide-Treated Nets (OR=1.92, CI= 1.07-3.92).
CONCLUSIONS: Promotions, products, price and place had significant association
with willingness to pay for Insecticide-Treated Nets. Designing a social
marketing strategy helps ensure sustainable supply of Insecticide-Treated Nets
and proper use of Insecticide-Treated Nets.

BACKGROUND: In many rural areas of Uganda, febrile patients presenting to health 
facilities are prescribed both antimalarials and antibiotics, contributing to the
overuse of antibiotics. We identified the prevalence and correlates of
inappropriate antibiotic management of patients with confirmed malaria.
METHODS: We utilized individual outpatient data from 36 health centers from
January to September 2011. We identified patients who were prescribed antibiotics
without an appropriate clinical indication, as well as patients who were not
prescribed antibiotics when treatment was clinically indicated. Multivariate
logistic regression models were used to identify clinical and operational factors
associated with inappropriate case management.
FINDINGS: Of the 45,591 patients with parasitological diagnosis of malaria,
40,870 (90%) did not have a clinical indication for antibiotic treatment. Within 
this group, 17,152 (42%) were inappropriately prescribed antibiotics. The odds of
inappropriate prescribing were higher if the patient was less than five years old
(aOR 1.96, 95% CI 1.75-2.19) and if the health provider had the fewest years of
training (aOR 1.86, 95% CI 1.05-3.29). The odds of inappropriate prescribing were
lower if patients had emergency triage status (aOR 0.75, 95% CI 0.59-0.96) or
were HIV positive (aOR 0.31, 95% CI 0.20-0.45). Of the 4,721 (10%) patients with 
clinical indications for antibiotic treatment, 521 (11%) were inappropriately not
prescribed antibiotics. Clinical officers were less likely than medical officers 
to inappropriately withhold antibiotics (aOR 0.54, 95% CI 0.29-0.98).
CONCLUSION: Over 40% of the antibiotic treatment in malaria positive patients is 
prescribed despite a lack of documented clinical indication. In addition, over
10% of patients with malaria and a clinical indication for antibiotics do not
receive them. These findings should inform facility-level trainings and
interventions to optimize patient care and slow trends of rising antibiotic
resistance.

BACKGROUND: Polyparasitism is still widespread in rural communities of the
developing world. However, the epidemiology of polyparasitism and implications
for morbidity are poorly understood. We studied patterns of multiple species
parasite infection in two rural communities of Côte d'Ivoire, including
associations and interactions between infection, clinical indicators and
self-reported morbidity.
METHODS: Between August and September 2011, two purposely selected rural
communities in southern Côte d'Ivoire were screened for helminth, intestinal
protozoa and Plasmodium infection, using a suite of quality-controlled diagnostic
methods. Additionally, participants were examined clinically and we measured
haemoglobin level, height, weight and mid-upper arm circumference to determine
nutritional status. An anamnestic questionnaire was administered to assess
people's recent history of diseases and symptoms, while a household questionnaire
was administered to heads of household to collect socioeconomic data.
Multivariate logistic regression models were applied for assessment of possible
associations between parasitic (co-)infections and morbidity outcomes.
RESULTS: 912/1,095 (83.3%) study participants had complete parasitological data
and 852 individuals were considered for in-depth analysis. The rate of
polyparasitism was high, with Plasmodium falciparum diagnosed as the predominant 
species, followed by Schistosoma haematobium, Schistosoma mansoni and hookworm.
There were considerable differences in polyparasitic infection profiles among the
two settings. Clinical morbidity such as anaemia, splenomegaly and malnutrition
was mainly found in young age groups, while in adults, self-reported morbidity
dominated. High parasitaemia of P. falciparum was significantly associated with
several clinical manifestations such as anaemia, splenomegaly and fever, while
light-intensity helminth infections seemed to have beneficial effects,
particularly for co-infected individuals.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinical morbidity is disturbingly high in young age groups in rural
communities of Côte d'Ivoire and mainly related to very high P. falciparum
endemicity. Interactions between helminth infections and P. falciparum burden
(parasitaemia and clinical morbidity) are evident and must be taken into account 
to design future interventions.

BACKGROUND: Serving on volunteer groups undertaking medical mission trips is a
common activity for health care professionals and students. Although volunteers
hope such work will assist underserved populations, medical mission groups have
been criticized for not providing sustainable health services that focus on
underlying health problems. As members of a volunteer medical mission group, we
performed a bed net indicator study in rural Mali. We undertook this project to
demonstrate that volunteers are capable of undertaking small-scale research, the 
results of which offer locally relevant results useful for disease prevention
programs. The results of such projects are potentially sustainable beyond the
duration of a mission trip.
METHODS: Volunteers with Medicine for Mali interviewed 108 households in Nana
Kenieba, Mali during a routine two-week medical mission trip. Interviewees were
asked structured questions about family demographics, use of insecticide treated 
bed nets the previous evening, as well as about benefits of net use and knowledge
of malaria. Survey results were analyzed using logistic regression.
RESULTS: We found that 43.7% of households had any family member sleep under a
bed net the previous evening. Eighty seven percent of households owned at least
one ITN and the average household owned 1.95 nets. The regression model showed
that paying for a net was significantly correlated with its use, while low
perceived mosquito density, obtaining the net from the public sector and more
than four years of education in the male head of the household were negatively
correlated with net use. These results differ from national Malian data and
peer-reviewed studies of bed net use.
CONCLUSIONS: We completed a bed net study that provided results that were
specific to our service area. Since these results were dissimilar to
peer-reviewed literature and Malian national level data on bed net use, the
results will be useful to develop locally specific teaching materials on malaria 
prevention. This preventive focus is potentially more sustainable than clinical
services for malaria treatment. Although we were not able to demonstrate that our
work is sustainable, our study shows that volunteer groups are capable of
undertaking research that is relevant to their service area.

Imputation without doing imputation: a new method for the detection of
non-genotyped causal variants.

Genome-wide association studies allow detection of non-genotyped disease-causing 
variants through testing of nearby genotyped SNPs. This approach may fail when
there are no genotyped SNPs in strong LD with the causal variant. Several
genotyped SNPs in weak LD with the causal variant may, however, considered
together, provide equivalent information. This observation motivates popular but 
computationally intensive approaches based on imputation or haplotyping. Here we 
present a new method and accompanying software designed for this scenario. Our
approach proceeds by selecting, for each genotyped "anchor" SNP, a nearby
genotyped "partner" SNP, chosen via a specific algorithm we have developed. These
two SNPs are used as predictors in linear or logistic regression analysis to
generate a final significance test. In simulations, our method captures much of
the signal captured by imputation, while taking a fraction of the time and disc
space, and generating a smaller number of false-positives. We apply our method to
a case/control study of severe malaria genotyped using the Affymetrix 500K array.
Previous analysis showed that fine-scale sequencing of a Gambian reference panel 
in the region of the known causal locus, followed by imputation, increased the
signal of association to genome-wide significance levels. Our method also
increases the signal of association from P ≈ 2 × 10⁻⁶ to P ≈ 6 × 10⁻¹¹. Our
method thus, in some cases, eliminates the need for more complex methods such as 
sequencing and imputation, and provides a useful additional test that may be used
to identify genetic regions of interest.

BACKGROUND: Plasmodium ovale and Plasmodium malariae have long been reported to
be widely distributed in tropical Africa and in other major malaria-endemic areas
of the world. However, little is known about the burden caused by these two
malaria species.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We did a longitudinal study of the inhabitants of Dielmo
village, Senegal, between June, 1990, and December, 2010. We monitored the
inhabitants for fever during this period and performed quarterly measurements of 
parasitemia. We analyzed parasitological and clinical data in a random-effect
logistic regression model to investigate the relationship between the level of
parasitemia and the risk of fever and to establish diagnostic criteria for P.
ovale and P. malariae clinical attacks. The prevalence of P. ovale and P.
malariae infections in asymptomatic individuals were high during the first years 
of the project but decreased after 2004 and almost disappeared in 2010 in
relation to changes in malaria control policies. The average incidence densities 
of P. ovale and P. malariae clinical attacks were 0.053 and 0.093 attacks per
person per year in children <15 years and 0.024 and 0.009 attacks per person per 
year in adults ≥ 15 years, respectively. These two malaria species represented
together 5.9% of the malaria burden.
CONCLUSIONS: P. ovale and P. malariae were a common cause of morbidity in Dielmo 
villagers until the recent dramatic decrease of malaria that followed the
introduction of new malaria control policies. P. ovale and P. malariae may
constitute an important cause of morbidity in many areas of tropical Africa.

BACKGROUND: Within affected communities, Plasmodium falciparum infections may be 
skewed in distribution such that single or small clusters of households
consistently harbour a disproportionate number of infected individuals throughout
the year. Identifying these hotspots of malaria transmission would permit
targeting of interventions and a more rapid reduction in malaria burden across
the whole community. This study set out to compare different statistical methods 
of hotspot detection (SaTScan, kernel smoothing, weighted local prevalence) using
different indicators (PCR positivity, AMA-1 and MSP-1 antibodies) for prediction 
of infection the following year.
METHODS: Two full surveys of four villages in Mwanza, Tanzania were completed
over consecutive years, 2010-2011. In both surveys, infection was assessed using 
nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR). In addition in 2010, serologic markers
(AMA-1 and MSP-119 antibodies) of exposure were assessed. Baseline clustering of 
infection and serological markers were assessed using three geospatial methods:
spatial scan statistics, kernel analysis and weighted local prevalence analysis. 
Methods were compared in their ability to predict infection in the second year of
the study using random effects logistic regression models, and comparisons of the
area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) for each model. Sensitivity
analysis was conducted to explore the effect of varying radius size for the
kernel and weighted local prevalence methods and maximum population size for the 
spatial scan statistic.
RESULTS: Guided by AUC values, the kernel method and spatial scan statistics
appeared to be more predictive of infection in the following year. Hotspots of
PCR-detected infection and seropositivity to AMA-1 were predictive of subsequent 
infection. For the kernel method, a 1 km window was optimal. Similarly, allowing 
hotspots to contain up to 50% of the population was a better predictor of
infection in the second year using spatial scan statistics than smaller maximum
population sizes.
CONCLUSIONS: Clusters of AMA-1 seroprevalence or parasite prevalence that are
predictive of infection a year later can be identified using geospatial models.
Kernel smoothing using a 1 km window and spatial scan statistics both provided
accurate prediction of future infection.

Introduction. Distribution of Affordable Medicine Facility-malaria Artemisinin
Combination Therapies (AMFm-ACTs) started in Nigeria in 2011, but its use at
community level has not been documented. Methods. Four hundred seventy-eight
caregivers whose under-five children had fever within two weeks prior to the
survey were selected using cluster sampling technique. Information on
sociodemographic characteristics, treatment seeking for malaria, and awareness
and use of AMFm-ACTs was collected using an interviewer administered
questionnaire. Result. More than half of the respondents (51.2%) bought AMFm-ACTs
without prescription. Awareness of AMFm was low as only 9.1% has heard about the 
programme. Overall, 29.2% used AMFm-ACTs as their first line choice of
antimalarial drug. On bivariate analysis age, group (25-34 years), public
servants, respondents with tertiary education, respondents with high
socioeconomic status, respondents with poor knowledge of symptoms of malaria,
awareness of AMFm-ACTs, availability of AMFm-ACTs, and sources of drug were
significantly associated with utilization of AMFm-ACTs (P < 0.05). Logistic
regression demonstrated that only people who were aware of AMFM-ACTs predicted
its use (AOR: 0.073; CI: 0.032-0.166; P < 0.001). Conclusion. Interventions which
targeted at raising awareness of AMFm-ACTs among people at risk of malaria are
advocated for implementation.

BACKGROUND: Malaria, schistosomiasis and soil transmitted helminth infections
(STH) are important parasitic infections in Sub-Saharan Africa where a
significant proportion of people are exposed to co-infections of more than one
parasite. In Tanzania, these infections are a major public health problem
particularly in school and pre-school children. The current study investigated
malaria and helminth co-infections and anaemia in school and pre-school children 
in Magu district, Tanzania.
METHODOLOGY: School and pre-school children were enrolled in a cross-sectional
study. Stool samples were examined for Schistosoma mansoni and STH infections
using Kato Katz technique. Urine samples were examined for Schistosoma
haematobium using the urine filtration method. Blood samples were examined for
malaria parasites and haemoglobin concentrations using the Giemsa stain and
Haemoque methods, respectively.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Out of 1,546 children examined, 1,079 (69.8%) were infected
with one or more parasites. Malaria-helminth co-infections were observed in 276
children (60% of all children with P. falciparum infection). Malaria parasites
were significantly more prevalent in hookworm infected children than in hookworm 
free children (p = 0.046). However, this association was non-significant on
multivariate logistic regression analysis (OR = 1.320, p = 0.064). Malaria
parasite density decreased with increasing infection intensity of S. mansoni and 
with increasing number of co-infecting helminth species. Anaemia prevalence was
34.4% and was significantly associated with malaria infection, S. haematobium
infection and with multiple parasite infections. Whereas S. mansoni infection was
a significant predictor of malaria parasite density, P. falciparum and S.
haematobium infections were significant predictors of anaemia.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These findings suggest that multiple parasite
infections are common in school and pre-school children in Magu district.
Concurrent P. falciparum, S. mansoni and S. haematobium infections increase the
risk of lower Hb levels and anaemia, which in turn calls for integrated disease
control interventions. The associations between malaria and helminth infections
detected in this study need further investigation.

BACKGROUND: Despite the encroaching of endemic malaria to highland-fringe areas
above 2000 meters above sea level in Ethiopia, there is limited information on
ownership and use of mosquito nets for malaria prevention. Thus, this study was
designed to assess long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN) possession and use for
malaria prevention in highland-fringe of south-central Ethiopia.
METHODS: A multi-stage sampling technique was employed to obtain household data
from randomly selected households using household head interview in October and
November 2008. Household LLIN possession and use was assessed using adjusted Odds
Ratio obtained from complex samples logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: Only less than a quarter (23.1%) of 739 households interviewed owned
LLINs with more differences between low (54.2%) high (3.5%) altitudes (Χ2 =253, P
< 0.001). Higher LLIN ownership was observed in illiterate (adj.OR 35.1
[10.6-116.2]), male-headed (adj.OR 1.7 [1.051-2.89]), owning two or more beds
(adj.OR 2.7 [1.6-4.6]), not doing draining/refilling of mosquito breeding sites
(adj.OR 3.4 [2.1-5.5]) and absence of rivers or streams (adj.OR 6.4 [3.5-11.8])
of household variables. The presence of ≥2 LLINs hanging (adj.OR 21.0
[5.2-85.1]), owning two or more LLINs (adj.OR 4.8 [1.3-17.5]), not doing
draining/refilling of mosquito breeding sites (adj.OR 4.2 [1.3-13.6]), low wealth
status (adj.OR 3.55 [1.04-12.14]), and < 1 km distance from absence of rivers or 
streams (adj.OR 3.9 [1.2-12.1]) of households was associated with more likely use
of LLIN. The LLIN ownership was low in the highlands, and most of the highland
users bought the bed nets themselves.
CONCLUSIONS: This study found a low household LLIN ownership and use in the
highland-fringe rural area. Therefore, improving the availability and teaching
effective use of LLIN combined with removal of temporary mosquito breeding places
should be prioritized in highland-fringe areas.

Insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITNs) are an essential tool of the Roll Back
Malaria strategy. An increasing number of African countries have embarked on mass
distribution campaigns of long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs) with the 
ultimate goal of universal coverage. Such a national campaign with the goal of
one ITN for every two people has been conducted in Burkina Faso in 2010. Our aim 
was to assess the coverage and equity effect of the universal distribution
campaign of LLINs in Burkina Faso and to identify determinants of ITN ownership
across households after the campaign. We evaluated its effects through comparison
of data from two household surveys conducted in early 2010 (before the campaign) 
and early 2011 (after the campaign) on a representative rural district in
north-western Burkina Faso. Data were collected on household characteristics
(including socio-economic status) and ITN ownership. We used concentration curves
and indices to compare ITN coverage indicators before and after the campaign and 
multilevel multivariate logistic regression to estimate factors associated with
achievement of the universal coverage target in 2011. The survey included 1106
households in 2010 and 1094 in 2011. We found that the proportion of households
with at least one ITN increased from 59% before the campaign to 99% afterwards,
whereas the concentration index dropped from 0.087 (standard error (SE): 0.014)
to 0.002 (SE: 0.002). Fifty-two per cent of households reached the target of one 
ITN for every two people per household, with the relevant concentration index at 
-0.031 (SE: 0.016). Eighty-six per cent of households owned at least one ITN for 
every three people. The main characteristics significantly associated with the
targeted intra-household coverage were family size and distance to the health
centre but not socio-economic status. In conclusion, despite not having fully met
its target, the national LLIN campaign achieved a high level of coverage and
fostered equity.

intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy in six districts of
Tanzania.

BACKGROUND: Intermittent preventive treatment during pregnancy (IPTp) with
optimal doses (two+) of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) protects pregnant women
from malaria-related adverse outcomes. This study assesses the extent and
predictors of uptake of optimal doses of IPTp-SP in six districts of Tanzania.
METHODS: The data come from a cross-sectional survey of random households
conducted in six districts in Tanzania in 2012. A total of 1,267 women, with
children aged less than two years and who had sought antenatal care (ANC) at
least once during pregnancy, were selected for the current analysis. Data
analysis involved the use of Chi-Square (χ2) for associations and multivariate
analysis was performed using multinomial logistic regression.
RESULTS: Overall, 43.6% and 28.5% of the women received optimal (two+) and
partial (one) doses of IPTp-SP respectively during pregnancy. Having had been
counseled on the dangers of malaria during pregnancy was the most pervasive
determinant of both optimal (RRR = 6.47, 95% CI 4.66-8.97) and partial
(RRR = 4.24, 95% CI 3.00-6.00) uptake of IPTp-SP doses. Early ANC initiation was 
associated with a higher likelihood of uptake of optimal doses of IPTp-SP
(RRR = 2.05, 95% CI 1.18-3.57). Also, women with secondary or higher education
were almost twice as likely as those who had never been to school to have
received optimal SP doses during pregnancy (RRR = 1.93, 95% CI 1.04-3.56). Being 
married was associated with a 60% decline in the partial uptake of IPTp-SP
(RRR = 0.40, 95% CI 0.17-0.96). Inter-district variations in the uptake of both
optimal and partial IPTp-SP doses existed (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Counseling to pregnant women on the dangers of malaria in pregnancy
and formal education beyond primary school is important to enhance uptake of
optimal doses of SP for malaria control in pregnancy in Tanzania. ANC initiation 
in the first trimester should be promoted to enhance coverage of optimal doses of
IPTp-SP. Programmes should aim to curb geographical barriers due to place of
residence to enhance optimal coverage of IPTp-SP in Tanzania.

Although ivermectin treatment can induce serious adverse events (SAEs) in
individuals harboring high Loa loa microfilaremia (mf), not all patients with
high mf levels develop such reactions, suggesting that cofactors may be involved.
A study was conducted in Cameroon to investigate the possible role of Plasmodium 
coinfection at the time of ivermectin treatment in the development of SAEs.
Before their first ivermectin treatment, thick smears were obtained from 4,175
individuals to determine the burden of Plasmodium sp., L. loa, and Mansonella
perstans. After treatment, 18 (4.3 per 1,000) patients developed a non-neurologic
SAE. Logistic regression analysis, adjusting for age, sex, P. falciparum
infection, and M. perstans infection intensities, confirmed that L. loa mf was
the main risk factor for SAEs. We found no evidence that coinfection with P.
falciparum at the time of ivermectin treatment was associated with the occurrence
of Loa-related SAEs in this population.

BACKGROUND: Antibodies have an essential role in the acquired immune response
against blood stage P. falciparum infection. Although several antigens have been 
identified as important antibody targets, it is still elusive which antigens have
to be recognized for clinical protection. Herein, we analyzed antibodies from
plasmas from symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals living in the same
geographic area in the Western Amazon, measuring their recognition of multiple
merozoite antigens.
METHODS: Specific fragments of genes encoding merozoite proteins AMA1 and members
of MSP and EBL families from circulating P. falciparum field isolates present in 
asymptomatic and symptomatic patients were amplified by PCR. After cloning and
expression of different versions of the antigens as recombinant GST-fusion
peptides, we tested the reactivity of patients' plasmas by ELISA and the presence
of IgG subclasses in the most reactive plasmas.
RESULTS: 11 out of 24 recombinant antigens were recognized by plasmas from either
symptomatic or asymptomatic infections. Antibodies to MSP9
(X2(DF=1) = 9.26/p = 0.0047) and MSP5 (X2(DF=1) = 8.29/p = 0.0069) were more
prevalent in asymptomatic individuals whereas the opposite was observed for MSP1 
block 2-MAD20 (X2(DF=1) = 6.41/p = 0.0206, Fisher's exact test). Plasmas from
asymptomatic individuals reacted more intensely against MSP4 (U = 210.5,
p < 0.03), MSP5 (U = 212, p < 0.004), MSP9 (U = 189.5, p < 0.002) and EBA175
(U = 197, p < 0.014, Mann-Whitney's U test). IgG1 and IgG3 were predominant for
all antigens, but some patients also presented with IgG2 and IgG4. The
recognition of MSP5 (OR = 0.112, IC95% = 0.021-0.585) and MSP9 (OR = 0.125,
IC95% = 0.030-0.529, cross tab analysis) predicted 8.9 and 8 times less chances, 
respectively, to present symptoms. Higher antibody levels against MSP5 and EBA175
were associated by odds ratios of 9.4 (IC95% = 1.29-69.25) and 5.7
(IC95% = 1.12-29.62, logistic regression), respectively, with an asymptomatic
status.
CONCLUSIONS: Merozoite antigens were targets of cytophilic antibodies and
antibodies against MSP5, MSP9 and EBA175 were independently associated with
decreased symptoms.

Introduction. Asymptomatic malaria is prevalent in highly endemic areas of Africa
and is new challenge for malaria prevention and control strategies. Objective. To
determine the prevalence of asymptomatic malaria and associated risk factors
among school children in Sanja Town, northwest Ethiopia. Methods. A
cross-sectional study was conducted from February to March 2013, on 385 school
children selected using stratified proportionate systematic sampling technique.
Pretested questionnaire was used to collect sociodemographic data and associated 
risk factors. Giemsa-stained thin and thick blood films were examined for
detection, identification, and quantification of malaria parasites. Data were
entered and analyzed using SPSS 20.0 statistical software. Multivariate logistic 
regression was done for assessing associated risk factors and proportions for
categorical variables were compared using chi-square test. P values less than
0.05 were taken as statistically significant. Results. The prevalence of
asymptomatic malaria was 6.8% (n = 26). The majority of parasitemic study
participants had low parasite density 65.5% (17/26). Level of grade, age, bed net
usage, and frequent exposure to malaria infection were associated with risk of
asymptomatic malaria. Conclusion. Asymptomatic malaria was low in this study area
and is associated with level of grade, age, bed net usage, and frequent exposure 
to malaria infection.

Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the most important public health problems in Tanzania
and was declared as a national public health emergency in 2006. Community and
individual knowledge and perceptions are critical factors in the control of the
disease. The objective of this study was to analyze the knowledge and perception 
on the transmission of TB in Tanzania. Multinomial Logistic Regression analysis
was considered in order to quantify the impact of knowledge and perception on TB.
The data used was adopted as secondary data from larger national survey 2007-08
Tanzania HIV/AIDS and Malaria Indicator Survey. The findings across groups
revealed that knowledge on TB transmission increased with an increase in age and 
level of education. People in rural areas had less knowledge regarding
tuberculosis transmission compared to urban areas [OR = 0.7]. People with the
access to radio [OR = 1.7] were more knowledgeable on tuberculosis transmission
compared to those who did not have access to radio. People who did not have
telephone [OR = 0.6] were less knowledgeable on tuberculosis route of
transmission compared to those who had telephone. The findings showed that
socio-demographic factors such as age, education, place of residence and owning
telephone or radio varied systematically with knowledge on tuberculosis
transmission.

PREDICTORS OF C-REACTIVE PROTEIN RESPONSE IN CHILDREN INFECTED WITH PLASMODIUM
FALCIPARUM MALARIA.

Utuk EE, Ikpeme EE, Udo JJ, Akpan MU.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the predictors of C-reactive protein response in plasmodium 
falciparum malaria as seen in children in a malaria endemic region of Nigeria.
DESIGN: A prospective cross-sectional study.
SETTING: The Children Out-patient (CHOP) Clinic, Children Emergency Unit (CHEU), 
Child Welfare/Growth Monitoring Clinic, Immunisation Centre and Paediatric Ward
of the University of Uyo Teaching Hospital (UUTH), Uyo in Akwa-Ibom State.
SUBJECTS: Three hundred and sixty children aged six to sixty months with
microscopically confirmed P. falciparum malaria compared with 360 healthy
children without malaria parasitaemia matched for age and gender.
RESULTS: The predictors of the C-reactive protein response in malaria (CRP ≥
10mg/l) were fever (t = 6.867; p = 0.001), malaria parasite count (t = 5.387; p =
0.001), severe anaemia (t = -11.23; p = 0.001) and age. Younger children had a
greater CRP response. The logistic regression curve showed a 66.9% sensitivity,
92.1% specificity, positive predictive value, 83.2% and negative predictive value
of 82.2% of predicting C-reactive protein response in malaria.
CONCLUSION: P. falciparum malaria induces significant CRP responses. Younger
children who present with fever, hyperparasitaemia and severe anaemia are more
likely to have C-reactive protein response with malaria.

This study assesses full and timely vaccination coverage and factors associated
with full vaccination in children ages 12-23 months in Gem, Nyanza Province,
Kenya in 2003. A simple random sample of 1,769 households was selected, and
guardians were invited to bring children under 5 years of age to participate in a
survey. Full vaccination coverage was 31.1% among 244 children. Only 2.2%
received all vaccinations in the target month for each vaccination. In
multivariate logistic regression, children of mothers of higher parity (odds
ratio [OR] = 0.27, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 0.13-0.65, P ≤ 0.01),
children of mothers with lower maternal education (OR = 0.35, 95% CI = 0.13-0.97,
P ≤ 0.05), or children in households with the spouse absent versus present (OR = 
0.40, 95% CI = 0.17-0.91, P ≤ 0.05) were less likely to be fully vaccinated.
These data serve as a baseline from which changes in vaccination coverage will be
measured as interventions to improve vaccination timeliness are introduced.

BACKGROUND: Use of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT), such as
artemether-lumefantrine (AL), requires a strict dosing schedule that follows the 
drugs' pharmacokinetic properties. The quality of malaria case management was
assessed in two areas in rural Tanzania, to ascertain patient characteristics and
facility-specific factors that influence correct dosing of AL for management of
uncomplicated malaria.
METHODS: Exit interviews were conducted with patients attending health facilities
for initial illness consultation. Information about health workers' training and 
supervision visits was collected. Health facilities were inventoried for capacity
and availability of medical products related to care of malaria patients. The
outcome was correct dosing of AL based on age and weight. Logistic regression was
used to assess health facility factors and patient characteristics associated
with correct dosing of AL by age and weight.
RESULTS: A total of 1,531 patients were interviewed, but 60 pregnant women were
excluded from the analysis. Only 503 (34.2%) patients who received AL were
assessed for correct dosing. Most patients who received AL (85.3%) were seen in
public health facilities, 75.7% in a dispensary and 91.1% in a facility that had 
AL in stock on the survey day. Overall, 92.1% (463) of AL prescriptions were
correct by age or weight; but 85.7% of patients received correct dosing by weight
alone and 78.5% received correct dosing by age alone. In multivariate analysis,
patients in the middle dosing bands in terms of age or weight, had statistically 
significant lower odds of correct AL dosing (p < 0.05) compared to those in the
lowest age or weight group. Other factors such as health worker supervision and
training on ACT did not improve the odds of correct AL dosing.
CONCLUSION: Although malaria treatment guidelines indicate AL dosing can be
prescribed based on age or weight of the patient, findings from this study show
that patients within the middle age and weight dosing bands were least likely to 
receive a correct dose by either measure. Clinicians should be made aware of AL
dosing errors for patients aged three to 12 years and advised to use weight-based
prescriptions whenever possible.

BACKGROUND: Successful implementation of malaria treatment policy depends on the 
prescription practices for patients with malaria. This paper describes
prescription patterns and assesses factors associated with co-prescription of
antibiotics and artemether-lumefantrine (AL) for patients presenting with fever
in rural Tanzania.
METHOD: From June 2009 to September 2011, a cohort event monitoring program was
conducted among all patients treated at 8 selected health facilities in Ifakara
and Rufiji Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS). It included all
patients presenting with fever and prescribed with AL. Logistic regression was
used to model the predictors on the outcome variable which is co-prescription of 
AL and antibiotics on a single clinical visit.
RESULTS: A cohort of 11,648 was recruited and followed up with 92% presenting
with fever. Presumptive treatment was used in 56% of patients treated with AL. On
average 2.4 (1 - 7) drugs was prescribed per encounter, indicating
co-prescription of AL with other drugs. Children under five had higher odds of AL
and antibiotics co-prescription (OR = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.46 - 0.85) than those aged 
more than five years. Patients testing negative had higher odds (OR = 2.22, 95%
CI: 1.65 - 2.97) of AL and antibiotics co-prescription. Patients receiving
treatment from dispensaries had higher odds (OR = 1.45, 95% CI: 0.84 - 2.30) of
AL and antibiotics co-prescription than those served in health centres even
though the deference was not statistically significant.
CONCLUSION: Regardless the fact that Malaria is declining but due to lack of
laboratories and mRDT in most health facilities in the rural areas, clinicians
are still treating malaria presumptively. This leads them to prescribe more drugs
to treat all possibilities.

BACKGROUND: Malaria during pregnancy is the main cause of low birth weight (LBW) 
in the tropics. There are few studies concerning B and T lymphocyte infiltrates
in placental malaria infections or their potential association with LBW babies.
METHODS: A case-control study was conducted at the Medani Hospital, Central
Sudan. Cases were women who had LBW deliveries (infants weighed < 2,500 g) and
controls were parturient women with normal birth weight babies. Sociodemographic 
and medical characteristics were gathered from both groups of women using
questionnaires. Cases and controls were investigated for malaria using
microscopic blood film analysis, placental histology, and immunohistochemistry
for detection of B (CD20) and T lymphocytes (CD3).
RESULTS: The two groups (97 in each arm) were well matched in their basic
characteristics. There were no malaria-positive blood films in either the cases
or the controls. Twenty-nine (30.0%) vs. 24 (24.7%), P = 0.519 of the cases vs.
the controls had placental malaria infections on histological examination. Three 
(3.1%), two (2.1%) and 24 (24.7%) vs. two (2.1%), two (2.1%) and 20 (20.6%) of
the placentae showed evidence of acute, chronic and past malarial infections on
histopathological examination of the two groups (case-control), respectively,
while 68 (70.1%) vs. 73 (75.3%) of them showed no signs of infection; P = 0.420. 
Women with placental malaria infections had significantly fewer CD20 cell
infiltrates [6 (11.3% vs. 95 (67.4%), P < 0.001)] and higher numbers of CD3 cell 
infiltrates [50 (94.3%) vs. 42 (29.8%), P < 0.001] than those without placental
malaria infection. Logistic regression analysis showed that neither placental
malaria infections nor CD3 or CD20 were associated with LBW.
CONCLUSIONS: Significantly higher rates of CD3 T cells and lower rates of CD20 B 
cells were found in women with placental malaria infections compared with those
without such infections. Neither placental malaria infection nor CD3 or CD20 are 
associated with LBW.

Malaria Consortium, Kampala, Uganda.

OBJECTIVE: To compare caretakers' perceived quality of care (PQC) for under-fives
treated for malaria, pneumonia and diarrhoea by community health workers (CHWs)
and primary health facility workers (PHFWs).
METHODS: Caretaker rated PQC for children aged (2-59) months treated by either
CHWs or PHFWs for a bought of malaria, pneumonia or diarrhoea was
cross-sectionally compared in quality domains of accessibility, continuity,
comprehensiveness, integration, clinical interaction, interpersonal treatment and
trust. Child samples were randomly drawn from CHW (419) and clinic (399) records 
from eight Midwestern Uganda districts. An overall PQC score was predicted
through factor analysis. PQC scores were compared for CHWs and PHFWs using
Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to
specify the association between categorized PQC and service providers for each
quality domain. Finally, overall PQC was dichotomized into "high" and "low" based
on median score and relative risks (RR) for PQC-service provider association were
modeled in a "modified" Poisson regression model.
RESULTS: Mean (SD) overall PQC was significantly higher for CHWs 0.58 (0 .66)
compared to PHFWs -0.58 (0.94), p<0.0001. In "modified" Poisson regression, the
proportion of caretakers reporting high PQC was higher for CHWS compared to
PHFWs, RR=3.1, 95%CI(2.5-3.8). In multinomial models PQC was significantly higher
for CHWs compared to PHFWs in all domains except for continuity.
CONCLUSION: PQC was significantly higher for CHWs compared to PHFWs in this
resource constrained setting. CHWs should be tapped human resources for universal
health coverage while scaling up basic child intervention as PQC might improve
intervention utilization.

Predictors of hyperlactataemia among children presenting with malaria in a low
transmission area in The Gambia.

and Tropical Medicine, London, UK. krishnan.bhaskaran@lshtm.ac.uk.

BACKGROUND: Hyperlactataemia and metabolic acidosis are important risk factors
for malaria death, but measuring lactate at the point of care is not financially 
viable in many resource-poor settings. This study aimed to identify combinations 
of routinely available parameters that could identify children at high risk of
hyperlactataemia.
METHODS: Using data from a study of Gambian children aged six months to 16 years 
with severe or uncomplicated malaria, logistic regression modelling with a
forward stepwise model selection process was used to develop a predictive model
for hyperlactataemia from routinely available demographic, clinical and
laboratory parameters. Potential predictors of hyperlactataemia considered for
the modelling process were patient characteristics (age, sex, prior use of
anti-malarials, and weight percentile for age), respiratory symptoms (deep
breathing, irregular respiration, use of accessory muscles of respiration, lung
crepitations, grunting respiration, cough, and age-specific respiratory rate),
other clinical parameters recorded at presentation (duration of symptoms,
Blantyre coma score, number of convulsions prior to admission, axillary
temperature, dehydration, severe prostration, splenomegaly) and laboratory
measures from blood tests (percentage parasitaemia, white cell count, lymphocyte 
count, neutrophil count, monocyte count, platelet count, haemoglobin level, blood
glucose level).
RESULTS: 495 children were included, and 68 (14%) had laboratory-confirmed
hyperlactataemia (lactate > 7 mmol/L). Four features were independently
associated with increased hyperlactataemia risk in a multivariable age- and
sex-adjusted model: lower Blantyre score (odds ratio (OR) compared to score 5 =
2.68 (95% CI, 1.03-6.96) for score 3-4 and 6.18 (95% CI, 2.24-17.07) for score
0-2, p = 0.001), higher percentage parasitaemia (OR = 1.07 (1.03-1.11) per 0031% 
increase, p < 0.001), high respiratory rate for age (OR = 3.09 (1.50-6.38) per
unit increase, p = 0.002), and deep breathing (OR = 2.81 (1.20-6.60), p = 0.02). 
Cross-validated predictions from the final model achieved area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve of 0.83.
CONCLUSIONS: This study identified predictors of hyperlactataemia requiring only 
simple bedside clinical examination and blood film examination that can be
carried out in resource-limited settings to quickly identify children at risk of 
dangerously raised lactate. A simple spreadsheet tool implementing the final
model is supplied as supplementary material.

Corrêa, Cuiabá, Mato Grosso State 78,060-900, Brazil. matanaka@cpd.ufmt.br.

BACKGROUND: In Brazil, 99% of the cases of malaria are concentrated in the Amazon
region, with high level of transmission. The objectives of the study were to use 
geographic information systems (GIS) analysis and logistic regression as a tool
to identify and analyse the relative likelihood and its socio-environmental
determinants of malaria infection in the Vale do Amanhecer rural settlement,
Brazil.
METHODS: A GIS database of georeferenced malaria cases, recorded in 2005, and
multiple explanatory data layers was built, based on a multispectral Landsat 5 TM
image, digital map of the settlement blocks and a SRTM digital elevation model.
Satellite imagery was used to map the spatial patterns of land use and cover
(LUC) and to derive spectral indices of vegetation density (NDVI) and
soil/vegetation humidity (VSHI). An Euclidian distance operator was applied to
measure proximity of domiciles to potential mosquito breeding habitats and gold
mining areas. The malaria risk model was generated by multiple logistic
regression, in which environmental factors were considered as independent
variables and the number of cases, binarized by a threshold value was the
dependent variable.
RESULTS: Out of a total of 336 cases of malaria, 133 positive slides were from
inhabitants at Road 08, which corresponds to 37.60% of the notifications. The
southern region of the settlement presented 276 cases and a greater number of
domiciles in which more than ten cases/home were notified. From these, 102
(30.36%) cases were caused by Plasmodium falciparum and 174 (51.79%) cases by
Plasmodium vivax. Malaria risk is the highest in the south of the settlement,
associated with proximity to gold mining sites, intense land use, high levels of 
soil/vegetation humidity and low vegetation density.
CONCLUSIONS: Mid-resolution, remote sensing data and GIS-derived distance
measures can be successfully combined with digital maps of the housing location
of (non-) infected inhabitants to predict relative likelihood of disease
infection through the analysis by logistic regression. Obtained findings on the
relation between malaria cases and environmental factors should be applied in the
future for land use planning in rural settlements in the Southern Amazon to
minimize risks of disease transmission.

BACKGROUND: Malaria and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are two major
infections with enormous public health consequence. Together, they are endemic in
many developing countries with anaemia being the most frequent haematological
consequence of the infections.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of malaria and HIV co-infection as well
as anaemia among selected patients from three health-care institutions in Lagos, 
Nigeria.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 1080 patients was carried out to determine
the prevalence of malaria and HIV co-infection as well as anaemia. Blood sera
from each of the patients were screened for malaria parasites, HIV-1 and HIV-2
using Giemsa stain, Cambridge Biotech Recombigen HIV-1/HIV-2 rapid device,
respectively while haemoglobin estimation was performed using cyanmethemoglobin
method.
RESULTS: Our data showed that the total number of malaria infected patients were 
significantly higher in HIV sero-positive patients 47.7% (31/65) when compared
with their HIV sero-negative counterparts 25.8% (262/1015) P = 0.047. The result 
also revealed that 25.8% (8/31) of the patients co-infected with malaria and HIV 
had anaemia as compared to 11.1% (29/262) infected with malaria alone.
Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that patients with dual
infection of malaria and HIV were twice likely to be anaemic than those infected 
with malaria alone [adjusted OR 2.4, 95% CI, 1.3 to 2.7, P = 0.014].
CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicated a higher prevalence of malaria in HIV infected
patients and also revealed that patients co-infected with malaria and HIV were
more likely to be anaemic.

Research Institute, Moshi, Tanzania. rekavishe@yahoo.com.

BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum resistance to anti-malarial drugs remains a
major obstacle to the control of malaria. In 2001 Tanzania replaced chloroquine
(CQ) with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) as first-line drug, which in turn was
replaced by artemisinin combination therapy in 2006. SP has however, continued to
be used in intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy (IPTp)
despite reports of high levels of resistance to SP due to the lack of
alternatives to SP for IPTp. Recent reports have indicated recovery of
CQ-susceptibility in Malawi, Kenya, Mozambique, and Tanzania based on the
prevalence of wild types at codon 76 of the Pfcrt gene in indigenous P.
falciparum populations. The current prevalence of this Pfcrt-76 CQ resistance
marker from six regions of Tanzania mainland is hereby reported.
METHODS: DNA extracted from filter-paper dried blood spots and rapid diagnostics 
kit strips collected from finger-prick blood were used to genotype the Pfcrt-76
resistance marker using PCR-RFLP. Data from previously published studies were
used to generate CQ susceptibility recovery trends using logistic regression
model.
RESULTS: Seven hundred and forty one (741) samples were genotyped. The current
frequency of the CQ-susceptible Pfcrt-K76 was above 92% and did not differ
between regions in Tanzania (χ(2) = 2.37; p = 0.795). The K76 allelic prevalence 
was between 85.7 and 93% in regions (χ(2) = 7.88, p = 0.163). The CQ resistance
recovery trends showed regional variability that may be caused by differences in 
malaria transmission intensity, but overall the trends converge as the
susceptibility levels in all regions approach >90%.
CONCLUSIONS: CQ withdrawal in Tanzania has resulted into >90% recovery of
susceptibility in ten years of withdrawal. These findings are in support of the
search for CQ-based combination drugs as a possible future alternative to SP for 
IPTp in places where full recovery of CQ-susceptibility will be evident.

BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to evaluate the distribution of a
series of independent doxycycline inhibitory concentration 50% (IC50) values to
validate the trimodal distribution previously described and to validate the use
of the pftetQ and pfmdt genes as molecular markers of decreased in vitro
doxycycline susceptibility in Plasmodium falciparum malaria.
METHODS: Doxycycline IC50 values, from 484 isolates obtained at the French
National Reference Centre for Imported Malaria (Paris) between January 2006 and
December 2010, were analysed for the first time by a Bayesian mixture modelling
approach to distinguish the different in vitro phenotypic groups by their IC50
values. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to evaluate the
pftetQ and pfmdt copy numbers of 89 African P. falciparum isolates that were
randomly chosen from the phenotypic groups.
RESULTS: The existence of at least three doxycycline phenotypes was demonstrated.
The mean doxycycline IC50 was significantly higher in the group with a pftetQ
copy number >1 compared to the group with a pftetQ copy number = 1 (33.17 μM
versus 17.23 μM) and the group with a pfmdt copy number >1 (28.28 μM versus 16.11
μM). There was a significant difference between the combined low and medium
doxycycline IC50 group and the high IC50 group in terms of the per cent of
isolates with one or more copy numbers of the pftetQ gene (0% versus 20.69%) or
pfmdt gene (8.33% versus 37.93%). In the logistic regression model, the pfmdt and
pftetQ copy numbers >1 (odds ratio = 4.65 and 11.47) were independently
associated with the high IC50 group.
CONCLUSIONS: Copy numbers of pftetQ and pfmdt are potential predictive molecular 
markers of decreased susceptibility to doxycycline.

OBJECTIVES: We prospectively investigated fever symptoms and maternal diagnosis
of malaria in pregnancy (MIP) in relation to child HIV infection among 2368
pregnant HIV-positive women and their infants, followed up from pregnancy until 6
weeks post-delivery in Tanzania.
METHODS: Doctors clinically diagnosed and treated MIP and fever symptoms during
prenatal health care. Child HIV status was determined via DNA polymerase chain
reaction (PCR). Multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate
relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for HIV mother-to-child
transmission (MTCT) by the 6th week of life.
RESULTS: Mean gestational age at enrolment was 22.2 weeks. During follow-up,
16.6% of mothers had at least one MIP diagnosis, 15.9% reported fever symptoms
and 8.7% had both fever and MIP diagnosis. Eleven per cent of HIV-exposed infants
were HIV-positive by 6 weeks. The RR of HIV MTCT was statistically similar for
infants whose mothers were ever vs. never clinically diagnosed with MIP (RR 1.24;
95% CI 0.94-1.64), were diagnosed with one vs. no clinical MIP episodes (RR 1.07;
95% CI 0.77-1.48) and had ever vs. never reported fever symptoms (RR 1.04; 95% CI
0.78-1.38) in pregnancy. However, the HIV MTCT risk increased by 29% (95% CI
4-58%) per MIP episode. Infants of women with at least two vs. no MIP diagnoses
were 2.1 times more likely to be HIV infected by 6 weeks old (95% CI 1.31-3.45).
CONCLUSIONS: Clinical MIP diagnosis, but not fevers, in HIV-positive pregnant
women was associated with an elevated risk of early HIV MTCT, suggesting that
malaria prevention and treatment in pregnant HIV-positive women may enhance the
effectiveness of HIV prevention in MTCT programmes in this setting. Future
studies using a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of malaria are needed to confirm
this association.

BACKGROUND: Understanding the role of local environmental risk factors for
malaria in holo-endemic, poverty-stricken settings will be critical to more
effectively implement- interventions aimed at eventual elimination.
Household-level environmental drivers of malaria risk during the dry season were 
investigated in rural southern Malawi among children < five years old in two
neighbouring rural Traditional Authority (TA) regions dominated by small-scale
agriculture.
METHODS: Ten villages were randomly selected from TA Sitola (n = 6) and Nsamala
(n = 4). Within each village, during June to August 2011, a census was conducted 
of all households with children under-five and recorded their locations with a
geographic position system (GPS) device. At each participating house, a nurse
administered a malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT) to children under five years
of age, and a questionnaire to parents. Environmental data were collected for
each house, including land cover within 50-m radius. Variables found to be
significantly associated with P. falciparum infection status in bivariate
analysis were included in generalized linear models, including multivariate
logistic regression (MLR) and multi-level multivariate logistic regression
(MLLR). Spatial clustering of RDT status, environmental factors, and Pearson
residuals from MLR and MLLR were analysed using the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic.
RESULTS: Of 390 children enrolled from six villages in Sitola (n = 162) and four 
villages in Nsamala (n = 228), 45.6% tested positive (n = 178) for Plasmodium
infection by RDT. The MLLR modelled the statistical relationship of Plasmodium
positives and household proximity to agriculture (<25-m radius), controlling for 
the child sex and age (in months), bed net ownership, elevation, and random
effects intercepts for village and TA-level unmeasured factors. After controlling
for area affects in MLLR, proximity to active agriculture remained a significant 
predictor of positive RDT result (OR 2.80, 95% CI 1.41-5.55). Mapping of Pearson 
residuals from MLR showed significant clustering (Gi* z > 2.58, p < 0.01)
predominantly within TA Sitola, while residuals from MLLR showed no such
clustering.
CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence for significant, dry-season
heterogeneity of malaria prevalence strongly linked to peridomestic land use, and
particularly of elevated risk associated with nearby crop production.

BACKGROUND: The complex interactions between the human host and the Plasmodium
falciparum parasite and the factors influencing severity of disease are still not
fully understood. Human single nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs associated with
Knops blood group system; carried by complement receptor 1 may be associated with
the pathology of P. falciparum malaria, and susceptibility to disease.
METHODS: The objective of this study was to determine the genotype and haplotype 
frequencies of the SNPs defining the Knops blood group antigens; Kna/b, McCoya/b,
Swain-Langley1/2 and KCAM+/- in Ghanaian patients with malaria and determine
possible associations between these polymorphisms and the severity of the
disease. Study participants were patients (n = 267) admitted to the emergency
room at the Department of Child Health, Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital, Accra, Ghana 
during the malaria season from June to August in 1995, 1996 and 1997, classified 
as uncomplicated malaria (n = 89), severe anaemia (n = 57) and cerebral malaria
(n = 121) and controls who did not have a detectable Plasmodium infection or were
symptomless carriers of the parasite (n = 275). The frequencies were determined
using a post-PCR ligation detection reaction-fluorescent microsphere assay,
developed to detect the SNPs defining the antigens. Chi-square/Fisher's exact
test and logistic regression models were used to analyse the data.
RESULTS: As expected, high frequencies of the alleles Kna, McCb, Sl2 and KCAM-
were found in the Ghanaian population. Apart from small significant differences
between the groups at the Sl locus, no significant allelic or genotypic
differences were found between the controls and the disease groups or between the
disease groups. The polymorphisms define eight different haplotypes H1(2.4%),
H2(9.4%), H3(59.8%), H4(0%), H5(25.2%), H6(0.33%), H7(2.8%) and H8(0%).
Investigating these haplotypes, no significant differences between any of the
groups were found.
CONCLUSION: The results confirm earlier findings of high frequencies of certain
CR1 alleles in Africa; and shed more light on earlier conflicting findings; the
alleles McCb, Sl2, Knb and KCAM- or combined haplotypes do not seem to confer any
protective advantage against malaria infection or resulting disease severity.
Based on these findings, in a very well-characterized population, malaria does
not seem to be the selective force on these alleles.

INTRODUCTION: Delay in the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) is common in
many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. Timely diagnosis of active tuberculosis is 
crucial in minimizing morbidity and mortality in the community as well as
nosocomial transmission in health care facilities. This study aimed at
determining factors associated with health service delay in the diagnosis and
initiation of treatment among new PTB patients presenting to the National
Referral Hospital-Mulago.
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study among eligible new PTB patients
presenting at the National referral TB treatment center Mulago hospital, between 
March to May 2009. The patients were consecutively recruited and interviewed
using a semi-structured questionnaire to assess socio- demographic and health
service factors. Multivariate logistic regression using odds ratios and 95%
confidence intervals was done.
RESULTS: Two hundred and sixty six newly diagnosed PTB patients were enrolled, of
which 65.4% experienced health systems delay. The median health service delay was
9days (IQR=8-19). Factors associated with health service delay were: 1n-patient
(OR= 4.68, 95% CI: 1.91-11.45), secondary as highest level of education attained 
(OR= 3.56, 95% CI: 1.18-10.74), primary as highest level of education attained
(OR= 6.70, 95% CI: 2.13-21.02), presence of fever (OR= 3.28, 95% CI: 1.05-10.79),
and patient delay at health facility (OR= 5.01, 95% CI: 1.33-18.9).
CONCLUSION: The study found a significant proportion of Health service delay
among pulmonary tuberculosis patients presenting at the referral hospital. Being 
an in-patient and having fever as a symptom of tuberculosis needs further
attention in order to have timely diagnosis. There is need for awareness on TB
especially that most of the TB symptoms present like other febrile illnesses such
as malaria and needs consideration when patients present to a health facility.

College, Tema, Ghana.

BACKGROUND: Intersectoral integration is acknowledged to be essential for
improving provision of health care and outcomes, yet it remains one of the main
primary health care strategic challenges. Although this is well articulated in
the literature, the factors that explain differentials in levels of intersectoral
integration have not been systematically studied, particularly in low and
middle-income countries. In this study, we examine the levels and determinants of
intersectoral integration amongst institutions engaged in malaria control
programmes in an urban (Kumasi Metropolitan) district and a rural (Ahafo Ano
South) district in Ghana.
METHODS: Interviews were conducted with representatives of 32 institutions
engaged in promoting malaria prevention and control. The averaging technique
proposed by Brown et al. and a two-level multinomial multilevel ordinal logistic 
regression were used to examine the levels of integration and the factors that
explain the differentials.
RESULTS: The results show high disparity in levels of integration amongst
institutions in the two districts. Integration was higher in the rural district
compared to the urban district. The multivariate analysis revealed that the
district effect explained 25% of the variations in integration. The type of
institution, level of focus on malaria and source of funding are important
predictors of intersectoral integration.
CONCLUSION: Although not causal, integrated malaria control programmes could be
important for improving malaria-related health outcomes in less developed regions
as evident from the rapid decline in malaria fatality rates observed in the Ahafo
Ano South district. Harmonisation of programmes should be encouraged amongst
institutions and the public and private sectors should be motivated to work in
partnership.

Epidemiologic studies of co-infection with tuberculosis (TB) and intestinal
parasites in humans have not been extensively investigated in China. A
cross-section study was conducted in a rural county of Henan Province, China.
Pulmonary TB (PTB) case-patients receiving treatment for infection with
Mycobacterium tuberculosis and healthy controls matched for geographic area, age,
and sex were surveyed by using questionnaires. Fecal and blood specimens were
collected for detection of intestinal parasites, routine blood examination, and
infection with human immunodeficiency virus. The chi-square test was used for
univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression models were used to
adjust for potential confounding factors. A total of 369 persons with PTB and 366
healthy controls were included; all participants were negative for human
immunodeficiency virus. The overall prevalence of intestinal parasites in persons
with PTB was 14.9%, including intestinal protozoa (7.9%) and helminthes (7.6%).
The infection spectrum of intestinal parasites was Entamoeba spp. (1.4%),
Blastocystis hominis (6.2%), Trichomonas hominis (0.3%), Clonorchis sinensis
(0.3%), Ascaris lumbricoides (0.5%), Trichuris trichiura (2.2%), and hookworm
(4.6%). The prevalence of intestinal parasites showed no significant difference
between persons with PTB and healthy controls after adjusting for potential
confounding factors. There was no factor that affected infection rates for
intestinal parasites between the two groups. Infection with intestinal parasites 
of persons with PTB was associated with female sex (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] =
2.05, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.01-4.17), body mass index ≤ 19 (AOR =
3.02, 95% CI = 1.47-6.20), and anemia (AOR = 2.43, 95% CI = 1.17-5.03). Infection
of healthy controls was only associated with an annual labor time in farmlands > 
2 months (AOR = 4.50, 95% CI = 2.03-10.00). In addition, there was no significant
trend between rates of infection with intestinal parasites and duration of
receiving treatment for infection with M. tuberculosis in persons with PTB. The
prevalence of intestinal parasites was not higher in persons with PTB, and there 
was no evidence that PTB increased susceptibility to intestinal parasites in this
study. However, for patients with PTB, women and patients with comorbidities were
more likely to be infected with intestinal parasites.

Education and Research, Pondicherry, India.

BACKGROUND: Although the term acute renal failure was replaced by acute kidney
injury (AKI) recently, there is a paucity of data on the incidence and profile of
AKI in critically ill children from the developing world.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to determine the incidence, etiology, 
short term outcome and predictors of fatality in critically ill children admitted
to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with AKI, aged 1 month to 13 years.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective observational study, from June 2010 to
March 2011, 215 children admitted to the PICU were screened for AKI, defined
according to the AKI Network criteria. The patients with AKI were followed-up
until discharge/death. Their clinical and biochemical data were recorded.
RESULTS: The incidence of AKI among 215 patients screened was 54 (25.1%). The
common etiologies were infections, [34 (62.9%)], acute glomerulonephritis (7.6%),
snake envenomation (5.7%), hemolytic uremic syndrome (3.8%) and congestive
cardiac failures (3.8%). Among infections, pneumonia and septicemia constituted
26.5% each, meningoencephalitis accounted for 23.5%, and dengue, scrub typhus,
tuberculosis and malaria constituted 9.3% of children with AKI. 27.8% of patients
required dialysis. Overall mortality was 46.3%. On logistic regression analysis, 
requirement of mechanical ventilation was an independent predictor of fatality in
AKI.
CONCLUSIONS: Besides the high incidence of AKI in critically ill-children
admitted to the PICU (25.1%), the condition was associated with adverse outcomes,
including high mortality (46.3%) and need for dialysis (27.8%). Infections
dominated the etiological profile. Requirement of mechanical ventilation
predicted an adverse outcome in our patient population.

BACKGROUND: Improving malaria case management is partially dependent on health
worker compliance with clinical guidelines. This study assessed health worker
factors associated with correct anti-malarial prescribing practices at two sites 
in rural Tanzania.
METHODS: Repeated cross-sectional health facility surveys were conducted during
high and low malaria transmission seasons in 2010 and collected information on
patient consultations and health worker characteristics. Using logistic
regression, the study assessed health worker factors associated with correct
prescription for uncomplicated malaria defined as prescription of
artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) for patients with fever and
Plasmodium falciparum asexual infection based on blood slide or malaria rapid
diagnostic test (RDT) according to national treatment guidelines.
RESULTS: The analysis included 685 patients with uncomplicated malaria who were
seen in a health facility with ACT in stock, and 71 health workers practicing in 
30 health facilities. Overall, 58% of malaria patients were correctly treated
with ACT. Health workers with three or more years' work experience were
significantly more likely than others to prescribe correctly (adjusted odds ratio
(aOR) 2.9; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-7.1; p = 0.019). Clinical officers
(aOR 2.2; 95% CI 1.1-4.5; p = 0.037), and nurse aide or lower cadre (aOR 3.1; 95%
CI 1.3-7.1; p = 0.009) were more likely to correctly prescribe ACT than medical
officers. Training on ACT use, supervision visits, and availability of job aids
were not significantly associated with correct prescription.
CONCLUSIONS: Years of working experience and health worker cadre were associated 
with correct ACT prescription for uncomplicated malaria. Targeted interventions
to improve health worker performance are needed to improve overall malaria case
management.

BACKGROUND: Where malaria endemicity is low, control programmes need increasingly
sensitive tools for monitoring malaria transmission intensity (MTI) and to better
define health priorities. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in a low
endemicity area of the Peruvian north-western coast to assess the MTI using both 
molecular and serological tools.
METHODS: Epidemiological, parasitological and serological data were collected
from 2,667 individuals in three settlements of Bellavista district, in May 2010. 
Parasite infection was detected using microscopy and polymerase chain reaction
(PCR). Antibodies to Plasmodium vivax merozoite surface protein-119 (PvMSP1₁₉)
and to Plasmodium falciparum glutamate-rich protein (PfGLURP) were detected by
ELISA. Risk factors for exposure to malaria (seropositivity) were assessed by
multivariate survey logistic regression models. Age-specific antibody prevalence 
of both P. falciparum and P. vivax were analysed using a previously published
catalytic conversion model based on maximum likelihood for generating
seroconversion rates (SCR).
RESULTS: The overall parasite prevalence by microscopy and PCR were extremely
low: 0.3 and 0.9%, respectively for P. vivax, and 0 and 0.04%, respectively for
P. falciparum, while seroprevalence was much higher, 13.6% for P. vivax and 9.8% 
for P. falciparum. Settlement, age and occupation as moto-taxi driver during
previous year were significantly associated with P. falciparum exposure, while
age and distance to the water drain were associated with P. vivax exposure.
Likelihood ratio tests supported age seroprevalence curves with two SCR for both 
P. vivax and P. falciparum indicating significant changes in the MTI over time.
The SCR for PfGLURP was 19-fold lower after 2002 as compared to before (λ1 =
0.022 versus λ2 = 0.431), and the SCR for PvMSP1₁₉ was four-fold higher after
2006 as compared to before (λ1 = 0.024 versus λ2 = 0.006).
CONCLUSION: Combining molecular and serological tools considerably enhanced the
capacity of detecting current and past exposure to malaria infections and related
risks factors in this very low endemicity area. This allowed for an improved
characterization of the current human reservoir of infections, largely hidden and
heterogeneous, as well as providing insights into recent changes in species
specific MTIs. This approach will be of key importance for evaluating and
monitoring future malaria elimination strategies.

Value of Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 level and malaria
retinopathy in distinguishing cerebral malaria from other acute encephalopathies 
in Kenyan children.

Kilifi.

BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of cerebral malaria is problematic in malaria-endemic
areas because encephalopathy in patients with parasitemia may have another cause.
Abnormal retinal findings are thought to increase the specificity of the
diagnosis, and the level of histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2) may reflect the
parasite biomass.
METHODS: We examined the retina and measured plasma HRP2 levels in children with 
acute nontraumatic encephalopathy in Kenya. Logistic regression, with HRP2 level 
as an independent variable and World Health Organization-defined cerebral malaria
and/or retinopathy as the outcome, was used to calculate malaria-attributable
fractions (MAFs) and retinopathy-attributable fractions (RAFs).
RESULTS: Of 270 children, 140 (52%) had peripheral parasitemia, 80 (30%) had
malaria retinopathy, and 164 (61%) had an HRP2 level of >0 U/mL. During
2006-2011, the incidence of HRP2 positivity among admitted children declined by
49 cases per 100 000 per year (a 78% reduction). An HRP2 level of >0 U/mL had a
MAF of 93% for cerebral malaria, with a MAF of 97% observed for HRP2 levels of ≥ 
10 U/mL (the level of the best combined sensitivity and specificity). HRP2 levels
of >0 U/mL had a RAF of 77% for features of retinopathy combined, with the
highest RAFs for macular whitening (99%), peripheral whitening (98%), and
hemorrhages (90%).
CONCLUSION: HRP2 has a high attributable fraction for features of malarial
retinopathy, supporting its use in the diagnosis of cerebral malaria. HRP2
thresholds improve the specificity of the definition.

BACKGROUND: Ocular toxicity was described in the late 1950s for some
anti-malarial drugs, but only limited information is available on the comparison 
of ocular toxicity of different anti-malarials.
METHODS: We conducted a follow-up study with a nested case-control analysis using
the General Practice Research Database to compare the risk of developing a
first-time diagnosis of an eye disorder during exposure of mefloquine,
chloroquine and/or proguanil or atovaquone/proguanil use to non-users. We
calculated incidence rates with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and odds ratios
using multivariate conditional logistic regression analyses.
RESULTS: We included 83,148 patients and identified 652 cases with an incident
eye disorder. The incidence rates with 95% CI of all eye disorders combined in
users of mefloquine, chloroquine and/or proguanil, atovaquone/proguanil or
travellers not using anti-malarials were 5.3 (4.3-6.5), 7.1 (5.0-9.9), 6.3
(5.6-7.2) and 5.1 (4.6-5.7), per 1000 person-years, respectively. As compared to 
non-users of anti-malarials, the adjusted odds ratio with 95% CI in the nested
case-control analysis for users of mefloquine, chloroquine and/or proguanil, or
atovaquone/proguanil were 1.33 (1.01-1.75), 1.61 (1.06-2.45), and 1.25
(1.03-1.52), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The study provides evidence that there was an increased risk of eye 
disorders in users of all anti-malarials compared to non-users of anti-malarials.

BACKGROUND: Community health workers in Dangme-West district, Ghana, treated
children aged 2-59 months with fever with either artesunate-amodiaquine (AAQ) or 
AAQ plus amoxicillin (AAQ + AMX) within a cluster-randomized controlled trial
(registration no. TDR/UNDP Trial registration A: 20189). The intervention was
introduced in a stepped-wedge manner. The aim of the study was reduction of
mortality. This paper reports on the reduction of morbidity, notably anaemia,
severe anaemia and severe illness. Clusters of 100 children were randomized in to
AAQ, AAQ + AMX and pre-intervention arms. Six months later the pre-intervention
clusters were randomized in to the AAQ and AAQ + AMX arms.
METHODS: Data were collected in eight cross-sectional surveys. Using stratified
sampling, 10 clusters were randomly selected per survey. Blood samples were taken
to assess haemoglobin. Caregivers were interviewed about diseases (signs and
symptoms) among their children in the preceding 14 days. Multivariate logistic
regression analysis was used to determine the impact on anaemia, severe anaemia
and severe illness.
RESULTS: Compared with the pre-intervention clusters, anaemia was reduced in the 
AAQ (OR = 0.20, 95% CI 0.12-0.33) and AAQ + AMX (OR = 0.23, 95% CI 0.15-0.36)
clusters, severe anaemia was reduced in the AAQ (OR = 0.20, 95% CI 0.09-0.45) and
AAQ + AMX (OR = 0.12, 95% CI 0.04-0.31) clusters and severe illness was reduced
in the AAQ (OR = 0.46, 95% CI 0.26-0.80) and AAQ + AMX (OR = 0.38, 95% CI
0.22-0.63) clusters. No significant differences were found in outcome variables
between the AAQ and AAQ + AMX clusters.
CONCLUSIONS: Treating fever with antimalarials significantly reduced the
prevalence of anaemia, severe anaemia and severe illness. We found no significant
reduction in outcomes when the AAQ and AAQ+AMX clusters were compared.

BACKGROUND: Community health workers (CHW) manage simple childhood illnesses in
many developing countries. Information on CHWs' referral practices is limited. As
part of a large cluster-randomised trial, this study assessed CHWs' adherence to 
dosing and referral guidelines.
METHODS: Records of consultations of children aged 2-59 months with fever managed
by CHWs were analysed. Appropriate use of drugs was defined as provision of the
correct drug pack(s) for the child's age group. Symptoms requiring referral were 
categorised into danger signs, respiratory distress and symptoms indicating other
illnesses. Multivariate logistic regression examined symptoms most likely to be
noted as requiring referral and those associated with provision of a written
referral.
RESULTS: Most children (11 659/12 330; 94.6%) received the appropriate drug. Only
161 of 1758 (9.2%) children who, according to the guidelines required referral
were provided with a written referral. Not drinking/breastfeeding, persistent
vomiting, unconsciousness/lethargy, difficultly breathing, fast breathing, bloody
stool, sunken eyes and pallor were symptoms significantly associated with being
identified by CHWs as needing referral or receiving a written referral.
CONCLUSIONS: CHWs' adherence to dosing guidelines was high. Adherence to referral
guidelines was inadequate. More effort needs to be put into strengthening
referral practices of CHWs within comparable community programmes.

INTRODUCTION: Diarrhoea kills more children than AIDS, malaria, and measles
combined. Knowing the determinants of a disease enables us to design an effective
intervention. The objective of this study was to identify the determinants of
acute diarrhoea and associated factors among children under 5 years of age in
Derashe district, south Ethiopia.
METHODS: A community based unmatched case-control study supplemented with Focus
Group Discussions (FGDs) was employed in rural kebeles (neighborhoods) of the
district. Collected data were entered in Epi Info v3.5.3
(wwwn.cdc.gov/epiinfo/info/) and descriptive data analyses were performed using
SPSS v16.0 (www.spss.com). Binary logistic regression analysis was used to
measure the association between dependent and independent variables,
calculating<b> </b>odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Statistical
significance was set at α ≤0.05. Multivariable analyses were applied to identify 
the relative effect of explanatory variables on the dependent variable.
RESULTS: The study revealed that the occurrence of diarrhoea was significantly
associated with lack of latrine ownership (adjusted [A] OR: 2.43, CI:1.19-4.87), 
lack of home-based water treatment (AOR: 2.25, CI:1.43-3.56), lack of improved
water sources (AOR: 1.98, CI:1.16- 2.23) and consumption of left-over food (AOR: 
1.65, CI:1.01-2.71).
CONCLUSIONS: The determinants of acute diarrhoea were of high preventive value
(latrine ownership, availability of home-based water treatment, source of water
and consumption of left-over food stored at room temperature), therefore health
education on different mechanisms in diarrhoeal disease causation, and prevention
methods, is recommended.

SUMMARY: We investigated and quantified the factors which may affect the
prevalence of cystic echinococcosis caused by Echinococcus granulosus in Rangtang
County using a multidisciplinary approach. From a previously performed field
survey, epidemiological data were linked with environmental data. Altitude and
land surface temperature were extracted from remote-sensing images. Cumulative
logistic regression models were used to identify and quantify the potential risk 
factors. The multiple regression models confirmed that yaks (χ 2 = 4·0447, P =
0·0443), dogs (χ 2 = 8·3455, P = 0·0039) and altitude (χ2 = 7·6223, P = 0·0058)
were positively correlated with the prevalence of cystic echinococcosis, while
land surface temperature may have a negative association. The findings showed
that dogs and yaks play the most important role in the transmission of cystic
echinococcosis, while altitude and land surface temperature may also be involved 
in the transmission.

BACKGROUND: Malaria and HIV infections during pregnancy can individually or
jointly unleash or confound pregnancy outcomes. Two of the probable outcomes are 
fetal anemia and cord blood malaria parasitemia. We determined clinical and
demographic factors associated with fetal anemia and cord blood malaria
parasitemia in newborns of HIV-positive women from two districts in Ghana.
RESULTS: We enrolled 1,154 antenatal attendees (443 HIV-positive and 711
HIV-negative) of which 66% were prospectively followed up at delivery. Maternal
malaria parasitemia, and anemia rates among HIV+ participants at enrolment were
20.3% and 78.7% respectively, and 12.8% and 51.6% among HIV- participants.
Multivariate linear and logistic regression models were used to study
associations. Prevalence of fetal anemia (cord hemoglobin level < 12.5 g/dL) and 
cord parasitemia (presence of P. falciparum in cord blood at delivery) were 57.3%
and 24.4% respectively. Factors found to be associated with fetal anemia were
maternal malaria parasitemia and maternal anemia. Infant cord hemoglobin status
at delivery was positively and significantly associated with maternal hemoglobin 
and gestational age whilst female gender of infant was negatively associated with
cord hemoglobin status. Maternal malaria parasitemia status at recruitment and
female gender of infant were positively associated with infant cord malaria
parasitemia status.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that newborns of women infected with HIV and/or
malaria are at increased risk of anemia and also cord blood malaria parasitemia. 
Prevention of malaria infection during pregnancy may reduce the incidence of both
adverse perinatal outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Pregnant women living in an area of stable malaria transmission such 
as Lagos, Nigeria, have been identified as being at an increased risk of the
effects of malaria infection. In this area, most of the infections are
asymptomatic which means they are overlooked and untreated much to the detriment 
of the mother and her foetus. The reality of scaled-up malaria interventions with
long-lasting insecticide treated nets, vector control, artemisinin combination
therapy (ACT) and intermittent preventive treatment of malaria pregnancy (IPTp)
using sulphadoxine pyrimethamine (SP) is that it is also essential to determine
the risk factors at play in these kinds of circumstances. This study was aimed at
identifying the factors associated with risk of malaria infection in pregnant
women in Lagos, Southwest Nigeria.
METHODS: Demographic information and malaria prevention practices of the pregnant
women studied were captured using structured questionnaire. Microscopy was used
to establish malaria infection, species identification and parasite density.
Relative risk and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to compare 
factors associated with malaria in pregnant women.
RESULTS: Malaria microscopy details, demographic information and malaria
prevention practices of the pregnant women were obtained using a structured
questionnaire. The prevalence of malaria using peripheral blood from 1,084
pregnant women that participated in the study was 7.7%. Plasmodium falciparum (P.
falciparum) was seen in 95.2% of the cases as either mixed infection with P.
malariae (3.6%) or as a mono infection (91.6%). Malaria preventive practices
associated with a significant reduction (P<0.05) in the malaria infection was the
use of insecticide sprays (RR = 0.36, 95 C.I. 0.24-0.54), and the combined use of
insecticide spray and insecticide-treated nets (ITN) (RR= 6.53, 95% C.I.
0.92-46.33). Sleeping under ITN alone (RR = 1.07, 95% C.I. 0.55-2.09) was not
associated with significant reduction in malaria infection among the study
participants with malaria parasitaemia. Young maternal age (<20years) (RR = 2.86,
95% C.I. 1.48 - 5.50), but not primigravidity (RR = 1.36, 95% C.I. 0.90-2.05),
was associated with an increased risk of malaria infection during pregnancy.
After a multivariate logistic regression, young maternal age (OR = 2.61, 95% C.I.
1.13 - 6.03) and the use of insecticide spray (OR = 0.38, 95% C.I. 0.24-0.63)
were associated with an increase and a reduction in malaria infection,
respectively.
CONCLUSION: Malaria prevalence was low among the pregnant women studied. Young
maternal age and non-usage of insecticidal spray were the main factors associated
with an increased risk of malaria infection among pregnant women in Lagos,
Nigeria.

BACKGROUND: Because the mechanisms by which Plasmodium and helminth parasites
affect nutritional status are different, these parasites likely have additive
effects when they co-exist in a host. This study aimed to compare the prevalence 
of undernutrition in patients infected with either Plasmodium or helminths and
those co-infected with the two types of parasites.
METHODS: Acute febrile patients suspected of having malaria who attended the
outpatient clinic at Dore Bafeno Health Center between December 2010 and February
2011 were examined for Plasmodium parasites using Giemsa-stained thick and thin
blood smears and for helminths using the thick Kato-Katz method. Nutritional
status was determined using anthropometric indices generated from height and
weight measurements.
RESULTS: Of the 702 patients examined, 34.5% were infected with helminths alone, 
12.3% were infected with Plasmodium alone, and 19.4% co-infected with Plasmodium 
and intestinal helminths. Out of the patients examined, 44.9% were
undernourished. The prevalence of undernutrition was not significantly different 
between those patients not infected with Plasmodium or helminth species and those
infected with Plasmodium or helminth species. The differences in the odds of
undernutrition were also not significant between patients who were co-infected
with different Plasmodium and helminth species and those with single infections
with Plasmodium or helminth species in our multivariable logistic regression
model adjusted for the confounding effects of age and sex.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of undernutrition was comparable in patients infected 
with Plasmodium or helminths alone and those co-infected with Plasmodium and
helminths in Dore Bafeno Health Center, Southern Ethiopia. However, further
studies are needed in areas of intense transmission where both parasites are
endemic to elucidate whether the impact of Plasmodium and helminth co-infection
on undernutrition is additive or multiplicative.

BACKGROUND: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and its treatment cause 
a range of hematological abnormalities. Anemia is one of the commonly observed
hematologic manifestations in HIV positive persons and it has multifactorial
origin.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the prevalence and risk factors of anemia in
highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) naïve and HAART experienced HIV
positive persons.
METHODS: A facility-based comparative cross sectional study was conducted in
Jimma University Specialized Hospital from February 1 to March 30, 2012. A total 
of 234 HIV positive persons, 117 HAART naïve and 117 HAART experienced, were
enrolled in this study. Blood and stool specimens were collected from each
participant. Blood specimens were examined for complete blood count, CD4 count
and blood film for malaria hemoparasite; whereas stool specimens were checked for
ova of intestinal parasites. Socio-demographic characteristics and clinical data 
of the participants were collected using pre-tested questionnaire. Statistical
analysis of the data (Chi-square, student's t-test, logistic regression) was done
using SPSS V-16.
RESULTS: The overall prevalence of anemia was 23.1%. The prevalence of anemia in 
HAART naïve and HAART experienced persons was 29.9% and 16.2%, respectively (P = 
0.014). Presence of opportunistic infections (P = 0.004, 95% CI = 1.69-15.46),
CD4 count <200 cells/µl (P = 0.001, 95% CI = 2.57-36.89) and rural residence (P =
0.03, 95% CI = 1.12-10.39) were found to be predictors of anemia for HAART naïve 
participants. On the other hand, HAART regimen (ZDV/3TC/NVP) (P = 0.019, 95% CI =
0.01-1.24) and the duration of HAART (P = 0.007, 95% CI = 0.003-0.40.24) were
found to be predictors of anemia for HAART experienced groups.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of anemia in HAART naïve persons was higher than HAART
experienced persons. Risk factors for anemia in HAART naïve and HAART experienced
HIV positive persons were different. Hence, there is a need for longitudinal
study to further explore the causes of HIV associated anemia and the pattern of
hemoglobin changes with initiation of HAART.

Impact of community-based larviciding on the prevalence of malaria infection in
Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.

Maheu-Giroux M(1), Castro MC.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Global Health and Population, Harvard School of Public Health,
Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.

BACKGROUND: The use of larval source management is not prioritized by
contemporary malaria control programs in sub-Saharan Africa despite historical
success. Larviciding, in particular, could be effective in urban areas where
transmission is focal and accessibility to Anopheles breeding habitats is
generally easier than in rural settings. The objective of this study is to assess
the effectiveness of a community-based microbial larviciding intervention to
reduce the prevalence of malaria infection in Dar es Salaam, United Republic of
Tanzania.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Larviciding was implemented in 3 out of 15 targeted wards
of Dar es Salaam in 2006 after two years of baseline data collection. This
intervention was subsequently scaled up to 9 wards a year later, and to all 15
targeted wards in 2008. Continuous randomized cluster sampling of malaria
prevalence and socio-demographic characteristics was carried out during 6 survey 
rounds (2004-2008), which included both cross-sectional and longitudinal data
(N = 64,537). Bayesian random effects logistic regression models were used to
quantify the effect of the intervention on malaria prevalence at the individual
level. Effect size estimates suggest a significant protective effect of the
larviciding intervention. After adjustment for confounders, the odds of
individuals living in areas treated with larviciding being infected with malaria 
were 21% lower (Odds Ratio = 0.79; 95% Credible Intervals: 0.66-0.93) than those 
who lived in areas not treated. The larviciding intervention was most effective
during dry seasons and had synergistic effects with other protective measures
such as use of insecticide-treated bed nets and house proofing (i.e., complete
ceiling or window screens).
CONCLUSION: A large-scale community-based larviciding intervention significantly 
reduced the prevalence of malaria infection in urban Dar es Salaam.

BACKGROUND: Malaria is endemic in 13 of 64 districts of Bangladesh, representing 
a population at risk of about 27 million people. The highest rates of malaria in 
Bangladesh occur in the Chittagong Hill Districts, and Plasmodium falciparum
(predominately chloroquine resistant) is the most prevalent species.
METHODS: The objective of this research was to describe the epidemiology of
symptomatic P. falciparum malaria in an area of Bangladesh following the
introduction of a national malaria control program. We carried out surveillance
for symptomatic malaria due to P. falciparum in two demographically defined
unions of the Chittagong Hill Districts in Bangladesh, bordering western Myanmar,
between October 2009 and May 2012. The association between sociodemographics and 
temporal and climate factors with symptomatic P. falciparum infection over two
years of surveillance data was assessed. Risk factors for infection were
determined using a multivariate regression model.
RESULTS: 472 cases of symptomatic P. falciparum malaria cases were identified
among 23,372 residents during the study period. Greater than 85% of cases
occurred during the rainy season from May to October, and cases were highly
clustered geographically within these two unions with more than 80% of infections
occurring in areas that contain approximately one-third of the total population. 
Risk factors statistically associated with infection in a multivariate logistic
regression model were living in the areas of high incidence, young age, and
having an occupation including jhum cultivation and/or daily labor. Use of long
lasting insecticide-treated bed nets was high (89.3%), but its use was not
associated with decreased incidence of infection.
CONCLUSION: Here we show that P. falciparum malaria continues to be hypoendemic
in the Chittagong Hill Districts of Bangladesh, is highly seasonal, and is much
more common in certain geographically limited hot spots and among certain
occupations.

Ababa, Ethiopia. woyessaa@yahoo.com

BACKGROUND: The highlands of Ethiopia, situated between 1,500 and 2,500 m above
sea level, experienced severe malaria epidemics. Despite the intensive control
attempts, underway since 2005 and followed by an initial decline, the disease
remained a major public health concern. The aim of this study was to identify
malaria risk factors in highland-fringe south-central Ethiopia.
METHODS: This study was conducted in six rural kebeles of Butajira area located
130 km south of Addis Ababa, which are part of demographic surveillance site in
Meskan and Mareko Districts, Ethiopia. Using a multistage sampling technique 750 
households was sampled to obtain the 3,398 people, the estimated sample size for 
this study. Six repeated cross-sectional surveys were conducted from October 2008
to June 2010. Multilevel, mixed-effects logistic regression models fitted to
Plasmodium infection status (positive or negative) and six variables. Both fixed-
and random-effects differences in malaria infection were estimated using median
odds ratio and interval odds ratio 80%. The odds ratios and 95% confidence
intervals were used to estimate the strength of association.
RESULTS: Overall, 19,207 individuals were sampled in six surveys (median and
inter-quartile range value three). Six of the five variables had about two-fold
to eight-fold increase in prevalence of malaria. Furthermore, among these
variables, October-November survey seasons of both during 2008 and 2009 were
strongly associated with increased prevalence of malaria infection. Children aged
below five years (adjusted OR= 3.62) and children aged five to nine years (adj.
OR= 3.39), low altitude (adj. OR= 5.22), mid-level altitude (adj. OR= 3.80),
houses with holes (adj. OR= 1.59), survey seasons such as October-November 2008
(adj. OR= 7.84), January-February 2009 (adj. OR= 2.33), June-July 2009 (adj.
OR=3.83), October-November 2009 (adj. OR= 7.71), and January-February 2010 (adj. 
OR= 3.05) were associated with increased malaria infection.The estimates of
cluster variances revealed differences in malaria infection. The village-level
intercept variance for the individual-level predictor (0.71 [95% CI: 0.28-1.82]; 
SE=0.34) and final (0.034, [95% CI: 0.002-0.615]; SE=0.05) were lower than that
of empty (0.80, [95% CI: 0.32-2.01]; SE=0.21).
CONCLUSION: Malaria control efforts in highland fringes must prioritize children 
below ten years in designing transmission reduction of malaria elimination
strategy.

Chloroquine-induced pruritus has been described as a common adverse event in
African patients being treated for Plasmodium falciparum malaria, and has been
associated with treatment discontinuation in this setting. In Latin America,
where Plasmodium vivax is the most common species causing malaria and chloroquine
is still used as the first-line schizonticidal for treating this parasite
infection, there are no reports on chloroquine-induced pruritus. This study aimed
to estimate the frequency of pruritus and associated risk factors in P.
vivax-infected patients treated with chloroquine in a reference centre in the
Brazilian Amazon. In this cross-sectional study, patients who were prescribed
with chloroquine for the treatment of microscopy-confirmed P. vivax infection in 
the past five days were actively asked about the occurrence of any level of
pruritus and potential risk factors were investigated. Univariable and
multivariable logistic regression was performed for the analysis of possible risk
factors in two sets of patients: (1) all the patients interviewed and (2)
restricted to patients with previous use of chloroquine. Among the 510 patients
interviewed, 20.4% (95%CI: 16.9-23.9%) developed any level of pruritus during
treatment with chloroquine. Most episodes of pruritus occurred during the first
two days of treatment and the most common location was hands and feet. In
multivariate analysis performed in the entire population, the only risk factors
independently associated to pruritus were allergy history (adjusted odds ratio
[AOR]: 1.83; 95%CI 1.02-3.31; p=0.044) and high parasitaemia (AOR: 1.96: 95%CI
1.22-3.13; p=0.005). In the analysis restricted to the 215 patients with previous
use of chloroquine, previous chloroquine-induced pruritus was a strong predictor 
of pruritus occurrence (AOR: 11.84: 95%CI 3.15-44.47; p<0.001). Two patients
(0.4%) interrupted treatment due to the severity of pruritus. Pruritus is a
common adverse event in patients being treated with chloroquine for P. vivax
malaria in the Brazilian Amazon. Host-parasite interaction may play a relevant
role in the development of pruritus and concurs with the finding of strong
association of pruritus with high parasitaemia and allergy history. Patients with
previous chloroquine-induced pruritus had a high risk for developing pruritus.
Due to its high frequency, this side effect cannot be neglected as it can have
major implications on patients' compliance to treatment hampering elimination
efforts in the region.

BACKGROUND: We investigated prevalence of acute kidney injury (AKI) at
hospitalization and its association with in-hospital mortality among Ugandan
children hospitalized with common acute infections, and predictors of mortality
among AKI children.
METHODS: We enrolled 2,055 children hospitalized with primary diagnoses of acute 
gastroenteritis, malaria, or pneumonia. Serum creatinine, albumin, electrolytes, 
hemoglobin, and urine protein were obtained on admission. Participants were
assessed for AKI based on serum creatinine levels. Demographic and clinical data 
were obtained using a primary care provider survey and medical chart review.
Logistic regression was used to determine predictors of in-hospital mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 278 (13.5%) of children had AKI on admission; for 76.2%, AKI 
was stage 2 (98/278) or stage 3 (114/278) defined as serum creatinine >2- or
3-fold above normal upper limit for age, respectively. AKI prevalence was
particularly high in gastroenteritis (28.6%) and underweight children (20.7%).
Twenty-five percent of children with AKI died during hospitalization, compared to
9.9% with no AKI (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 3.5 (95% CI, 2.2-5.5)). In-hospital
mortality risk did not differ by AKI stage. Predictors of in-hospital mortality
among AKI children included primary diagnosis of pneumonia, aOR 4.5 (95% CI,
1.8-11.2); proteinuria, aOR = 2.1 (95% CI, 1.0-4.9) and positive human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status, aOR 5.0 (95% CI, 2.0-12.9).
CONCLUSIONS: Among children hospitalized with gastroenteritis, malaria, or
pneumonia, AKI at admission was common and associated with high in-hospital
mortality.

BACKGROUND: Most African countries have adopted artemisinin-based combination
therapy (ACT) as the first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria. The World
Health Organization now recommends limiting anti-malarial treatment to those with
a positive malaria test result. Limited data exist on how these policies have
affected ACT prescription practices.
METHODS: Data were collected from all outpatients presenting to six public health
facilities in Uganda as part of a sentinel site malaria surveillance programme.
Training in case management, encouragement of laboratory-based diagnosis of
malaria, and regular feedback were provided. Data for this report include
patients with laboratory confirmed malaria who were prescribed anti-malarial
therapy over a two-year period. Patient visits were analysed in two groups: those
considered ACT candidates (defined as uncomplicated malaria with no referral for 
admission in patients ≥ 4 months of age and ≥ 5 kg in weight) and those who may
not have been ACT candidates. Associations between variables of interest and
failure to prescribe ACT to patients who were ACT candidates were estimated using
multivariable logistic regression.
RESULTS: A total of 51,355 patient visits were included in the analysis and
46,265 (90.1%) were classified as ACT candidates. In the ACT candidate group,
94.5% were correctly prescribed ACT. Artemether-lumefantrine made up 97.3% of ACT
prescribed. There were significant differences across the sites in the proportion
of patients for whom there was a failure to prescribe ACT, ranging from 3.0-9.3%.
Young children and woman of childbearing age had higher odds of failure to
receive an ACT prescription. Among patients who may not have been ACT candidates,
the proportion prescribed quinine versus ACT differed based on if the patient had
severe malaria or was referred for admission (93.4% vs 6.5%) or was below age or 
weight cutoffs for ACT (41.4% vs 57.2%).
CONCLUSIONS: High rates of compliance with recommended ACT use can be achieved in
resource-limited settings. The unique health facility-based malaria surveillance 
system operating at these clinical sites may provide a framework for improving
appropriate ACT use at other sites in sub-Saharan Africa.

BACKGROUND: The last decade has witnessed increased funding for malaria control. 
Malaria experts have used the opportunity to advocate for rollout of such
interventions as free bed nets. A free bed net distribution strategy is seen as
the quickest way to improve coverage of effective malaria control tools
especially among poorest communities. Evidence to support this claim is however, 
sparse. This study explored the effectiveness of targeted free bed net
distribution strategy in achieving equity in terms of ownership and use of bed
nets and also reduction of malaria prevalence among children under-five years of 
age.
METHODS: National malaria indicator survey (MIS) data from Angola, Tanzania and
Uganda was used in the analysis. Hierarchical multilevel logistic regression
models were used to analyse the relationship between variables of interest.
Outcome variables were defined as: childhood test-confirmed malaria infections,
household ownership of any mosquito net and children's use of any mosquito nets. 
Marginal effects of having free bed net distribution on households with different
wealth status were calculated.
RESULTS: Angolan children from wealthier households were 6.4 percentage points
less likely to be parasitaemic than those in poorest households, whereas those
from Tanzania and Uganda were less likely to test malaria positive by 7 and 11.6 
percentage points respectively (p < 0.001). The study estimates and present
results on the marginal effects based on the impact of free bed net distribution 
on children's malaria status given their socio-economic background. Poorest
households were less likely to own a net by 21.4% in Tanzania, and 2.8% in
Uganda, whereas both poorer and wealthier Angolan households almost achieved
parity in bed net ownership (p < 0.001). Wealthier households had a higher margin
of using nets than poorest people in both Tanzania and Uganda by 11.4% and 3.9%
respectively. However, the poorest household in Angola had a 6.1% net use
advantage over children in wealthier households (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: This is the first study to use nationally representative data to
explore inequalities in bed net ownership and related consequences on childhood
malaria infection rates across different countries. While targeted distribution
of free bed nets improved overall bed net ownership, it did not overcome
ownership inequalities as measured by household socioeconomic status. Use of bed 
nets was disproportionately lower among poorest children, except for Angola where
bed net use was higher among poorest households when compared to children in
wealthier households. The study highlights the need for malaria control world
governing bodies and policy makers to continue working on finding appropriate
strategies to improve access to effective malaria control tools especially by the
poorest who often times bears the brunt of malaria burden than their wealthier
counterparts.

INTRODUCTION: The objectives of the study were to evaluate the health system
effectiveness of ANC for the delivery of a dose of IPTp and an ITN to women
attending ANC during eligible gestation, and to identify the predictors of
systems effectiveness.
METHODS: A cross sectional study was undertaken in 10 health facilities including
structured non-participant observations of the ANC process for 780 pregnant women
followed by exit interviews. The proportion of pregnant women receiving a dose of
IPTp-SP and an ITN was assessed. Predictors of each ineffective intermediate
process were identified using multivariable logistic regression.
RESULTS: Overall, 0% and 24.5% of pregnant women of eligible gestation on the
first visit to ANC received a dose of IPTp-SP by DOT at the district and
community levels respectively. Ineffective intermediate processes were 'given
IPTp-SP at the ANC' 63.9% and 74.0% (95% CI 62.0, 83.3), and 'given IPTp-SP by
DOT' 0% and 34.3% (95% CI 10.5, 69.8), at district and community levels,
respectively. Delivery of ITNs was effective where they were in stock; however
stock-outs were a problem. Predictors of receiving IPTp-SP at the district level 
were 4 to 6 months gestation, not reporting symptoms of malaria at ANC visit and 
the amount of money spent during the visit. At the community level, the
predictors were 4 to 6 months gestation, maternal education below primary level, 
routine ANC visit (not for an illness), palpation of the abdomen, and expenditure
of money in ANC.
CONCLUSION: In Segou District, the delivery of IPTp-SP was ineffective; whilst
ITN delivery was effective if ITNs were in stock. Predictors of receiving IPTp-SP
at the district and community levels included gestational age, the amount of
expenditure during the ANC visit and no illness.

To determine the magnitude of Plasmodium vivax relapsing malaria in rural
Amazonia, we carried out a study in four sites in northeastern Peru. Polymerase
chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism of PvMSP-3α and tandem
repeat (TR) markers were compared for their ability to distinguish relapse versus
reinfection. Of 1,507 subjects with P. vivax malaria, 354 developed > 1 episode
during the study; 97 of 354 (27.5%) were defined as relapse using Pvmsp-3α alone.
The addition of TR polymorphism analysis significantly reduced the number of
definitively defined relapses to 26 of 354 (7.4%) (P < 0.05). Multivariate
logistic regression modeling showed that the probability of having > 1 infection 
was associated with the following: subjects in Mazan (odds ratio [OR] = 2.56; 95%
confidence interval [CI] 1.87, 3.51), 15-44 years of age (OR = 1.49; 95% CI 1.03,
2.15), traveling for job purposes (OR = 1.45; 95%CI 1.03, 2.06), and travel
within past month (OR = 1.46; 95% CI 1.0, 2.14). The high discriminatory capacity
of the molecular tools shown here is useful for understanding the micro-geography
of malaria transmission.

BACKGROUND: Severe malaria remains a major cause of death and morbidity amongst
adults in the Asiatic tropics.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the clinical and laboratory data of 988
adult patients, hospitalized with Plasmodium falciparum malaria and prospectively
recruited to malaria studies in western Thailand between 1986 and 2002, was
performed to assess the factors associated with a fatal outcome. Different
severity scores and classifications for defining severe malaria were compared
and, using multiple logistic regression, simple models for predicting mortality
developed.
RESULTS: The proportion of patients fulfilling the WHO 2000 definition of severe 
malaria was 78.1%, and their mortality was 10%. Mortality in patients given
parenteral artesunate or artemether (16/317, 5%) was lower than in those given
parenteral quinine (59/442, 13%) (P < 0.001). Models using parameter sets based
on WHO 1990, 2000 and Adapted AQ criteria plus blood smear parasite-stage
assessment gave the best mortality prediction. A malaria prognostic index (MPI), 
derived from the dataset using five clinical or laboratory variables gave similar
prognostic accuracy.
CONCLUSIONS: The mortality of severe malaria in adults has fallen and the switch 
from quinine to artesunate has probably been an important contributor. Prognostic
indices based on WHO 2000 definitions, and other simpler indices based on fewer
variables, provide clinically useful predictions of outcome in Asian adults with 
severe malaria.

    J Travel Med. 2013 Jul-Aug;20(4):217-20.

BACKGROUND: Primary care physicians (PCP) are first in line to provide adequate
pre-travel medical advice. Little data are available on the content of pre-travel
PCP consultations in France. We undertook an observational survey to assess the
level of specific knowledge among PCPs on health advice, vaccinations, and
malaria prophylaxis.
METHODS: Standardized questionnaires were sent to a random sample of 400 PCPs
practicing in the Franche-Comté regions (eastern France) who were asked to
complete and return it on a voluntary and anonymous basis. The questionnaire
requested sociodemographic details, practice-related characteristics, and
proposed three clinical situations with multiple choice questions (MCQ). To
identify factors associated with a higher level of specific knowledge in travel
medicine, results were studied by uni- and multivariate analyses. An overall
score was calculated based on the MCQ answers and a motivation score was
calculated based on parameters such as frequency and developments in pre-travel
consulting at the practice, PCPs' personal experience as travelers, and the
formal agreement of PCPs to administer yellow fever vaccination.
RESULTS: The response rate was 37.5%, with 150 questionnaires returned completed 
and suitable for analysis. After multivariate logistic regression, the three
variables associated with a higher score were: proximity of a vaccination center 
(p = 0.001), motivation score (p = 0.004), and absence of request for expert
advice on malaria prophylaxis (p = 0.007).
CONCLUSIONS: PCPs play an important role in travel medicine. This study showed
that their high level of knowledge in travel medicine was mostly linked to their 
motivation to practice in this specialized discipline.

BACKGROUND: Malaria in pregnancy can have devastating consequences for mother and
baby. Coverage with the WHO prevention strategy for sub-Saharan Africa of
intermittent-preventive-treatment (IPTp) with two doses of
sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) and insecticide-treated-nets (ITNs) in pregnancy 
is low. We analysed household survey data to evaluate the effectiveness of
antenatal clinics (ANC) to deliver IPTp and ITNs to pregnant women in Nyando
district, Kenya.
METHODS: We assessed the systems effectiveness of ANC to deliver IPTp and ITNs to
pregnant women and the impact on low birthweight (LBW). Logistic regression was
used to identify predictors of receipt of IPTp and ITN use during pregnancy.
RESULTS: Among 89% of recently pregnant women who attended ANC at least once
between 4-9 months gestation, 59% reported receiving one dose of SP and 90%
attended ANC again, of whom 57% received a second dose, resulting in a cumulative
effectiveness for IPTp of 27%, most of whom used an ITN (96%). Overall ITN use
was 89%, and ANC the main source (76%). Women were less likely to receive IPTp if
they had low malaria knowledge (0.26, 95% CI 0.08-0.83), had a child who had died
(OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.14-0.95), or if they first attended ANC late (OR 0.20, 95% CI 
0.06-0.67). Women who experienced side effects to SP (OR 0.18, CI 0.03-0.90) or
had low malaria knowledge (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.11-5.43) were less likely to receive
IPTp by directly observed therapy. Ineffective delivery of IPTp reduced its
potential impact by 231 LBW cases averted (95% CI 64-359) per 10,000 pregnant
women.
CONCLUSION: IPTp presents greater challenges to deliver through ANC than ITNs in 
this setting. The reduction in public health impact on LBW resulting from
ineffective delivery of IPTp is estimated to be substantial. Urgent efforts are
required to improve service delivery of this important intervention.

BACKGROUND: We aimed to assess the relationship between gender and survival among
adult patients newly enrolled on antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Uganda. We also 
specifically examined the role of antenatal services in favoring women's access
to HIV care.
METHODS: From an observational cohort study, we assessed survival and used
logistic regression and differences in means to compare men and women who did not
access care through antenatal services. Differences were assessed on measures of 
disease progression (WHO stage and CD4 count) and demographic (age, marital
status, and education), behavioral (sexual activity, disclosure to partner, and
testing), and clinical variables (hepatitis B and C, syphilis, malaria, and
anemia). A mediational analysis that considered gender as the initial variable,
time to death as the outcome, initial CD4 count as the mediator, and age as a
covariate was performed using an accelerated failure time model with a Weibull
distribution.
RESULTS: Between 2004 and 2011, a total of 4775 patients initiated ART, and after
exclusions 4537 (93.2%) were included in analysis. Men initiating ART were more
likely to have a WHO disease stage III or IV (odds ratio: 1.46, 95% confidence
interval [CI]: 1.29-1.66), and lower CD4 cell counts compared to women (median
baseline CD4 124 cells/mm(3), interquartile range [IQR]: 43-205 versus 147
cells/mm(3), IQR: 68-212, P-value < 0.0001). Men were at an increased risk of
death compared to women (hazard ratio: 1.38, 95% CI: 1.03-1.83). Baseline CD4
cell counts accounted for 43% of the increased risk of death in men (95% CI:
22%-113%). Access to care via antenatal services did not explain differences in
outcomes.
CONCLUSION: In this cohort there is a marked increase in risk of mortality for
men and approximately half of it can be attributed to their later engagement in
care. More effort is required to engage men in care in a timely manner.

INTRODUCTION: Hypoglycemia is a defining feature of severe malaria and several
other infectious diseases in children but the prevalence, significance, and
prognosis of abnormal blood glucose, including hyperglycemia, have rarely been
addressed in severely ill children in non-malaria endemic areas.
METHODS: In Madagascar, consecutive children (1 month-15 years) admitted to the
pediatric ward of a referral hospital, were categorized using the integrated
management of childhood illness (IMCI). Samples were taken once on admission for 
measuring blood glucose concentration. Glycemia levels (hypoglycemia <2.2 mmol/l;
low glycemia: 2.2-4.4 mmol/l; normoglycemia >4.4-8.3 mmol/l; and hyperglycemia
>8.3 mmol/l) were related to the IMCI algorithm and case fatality. Factors
associated with blood glucose concentration and case fatality were analysed using
univariate and multivariate analysis.
RESULTS: Of 420 children, 48.1% (n = 202) were severely ill; 3.1% (n = 13) had
hypoglycemia; 20.0% (n = 84) low glycemia; 65.9% (n = 277) normoglycemia; and
10.9% (n = 46) hyperglycemia. In univariate analysis, hypoglycemia and
hyperglycemia both showed significant increase in the risk of death, as compared 
to normal blood glucose (RR: 12.2, 95% CI: 6.2-23.7 and RR: 2.5, 95% CI: 1.0-6.2,
respectively). Children with low glycemia had no increased risk of death (RR:
1.2, 95% CI: 0.4-3.2) despite a poorer IMCI status on admission. After logistic
regression, hypoglycemia (RR: 19.4, 95% CI: 5.0-.74.7, hepatomegaly (RR: 12.2,
95% CI: 3.3-44.9) and coma (RR: 4.8, 95% CI: 1.3-17.6) were the features on
admission associated with an increased risk of death.
CONCLUSIONS: Dysglycemia in non-neonates is associated with increased mortality. 
These findings underline the need for the use of rapid screening tests to
initiate early treatment. Alternative treatments such as oral or sublingual
administration of glucose should be developed in structures with limited
resources.

BACKGROUND: Malaria is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Uganda.
The Ministry of Health (MoH) plans to scale up indoor residual spraying (IRS) for
malaria vector control. However, there is limited information on community
knowledge and perceptions towards IRS. This study assessed community knowledge
and perceptions about IRS in Soroti district, eastern Uganda.
METHODS: The study was cross-sectional and it covered 770 randomly selected
households in urban and rural settings in Soroti district, Eastern Uganda. The
respondents were heads of household and or their proxies. The data were collected
on the sociodemographic characteristics, knowledge of the insecticides that could
be used for IRS, parts of the houses that would be sprayed, importance of IRS,
role of household heads in IRS programme, frequency and the time of spraying.
Responses to the questions on these areas were used to create a composite
dependent variable categorized as knowledgeable if they had responded correctly
to at least three questions or not knowledgeable about IRS if they responded
correctly to less than three questions. In addition, respondents were asked if
they thought the IRS programme would be beneficial or not. Bivariate and
multivariate logistic regression analyses were carried out using SPSS version 17.
RESULTS: Less than half, (48.6%, 374/770) of the respondents were knowledgeable
about IRS. Urban residents (AOR 1.92, 95% CI 1.04-3.56) and those with secondary 
education or higher (AOR 4.81, 95% CI 2.72-8.52) were knowledgeable about IRS.
Three-quarters, (74.4%, 354/473) of respondents who had ever heard of IRS,
perceived it as beneficial. Two-thirds, (66.4%, 314/473) reported that IRS would 
have negative effects. Respondents who reported that, IRS programme is beneficial
were: 23 years or older (AOR 2.17, 95% CI 1.07-4.38), had attained secondary
education or higher (AOR 2.16, 95% CI 1.22-3.83) and were knowledgeable about IRS
(AOR 2.21, 95% CI 1.17-4.17).
CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge about IRS is inadequate and negative perceptions about its
use are prominent especially among the rural and less educated individuals. To
ensure householders' cooperation and participation in the IRS programme, adequate
community mobilization and sensitization is needed prior to use of IRS for
effective malaria control.

Association of doxycycline use with the development of gastroenteritis, irritable
bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease in Australians deployed abroad.

Australia.

BACKGROUND: The risks are unknown for developing chronic gastrointestinal illness
when personnel are relocated short term to other countries and when taking
antibiotic prophylaxis in areas where malaria is endemic.
AIM: To examine the associations of deployment to developed or developing
countries and exposure to doxycycline with the new onset of acute
gastroenteritis, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease
(IBD).
METHODS: A cross-sectional web-based survey of all current and past members of
the Australian Federal Police Association was undertaken. Independent predictors 
of gastrointestinal illness were examined by logistic regression analysis
relative to those not deployed without exposure to doxycycline.
RESULTS: Of 1300 respondents (response rate 34%), 133 were excluded due to
pre-existing chronic gastrointestinal illness. Five hundred and ninety had
episodes of overseas deployment for a median duration of 6.5 (range 0.1-149)
months. Eighteen (3%) of those not deployed took doxycycline compared with 171
(30%) of those deployed. The risk of acute gastroenteritis was associated with
deployment itself without clear association with doxycycline. Doxycycline
exposure was associated with increased onset of IBS in those deployed to
developing (odds ratio [OR], 6.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.19-15.31) and 
developed country (OR, 6.93; 95% CI, 1.40-34.39). New onset of IBD (1.5%) was
associated with deployment to developed countries and with doxycycline exposure
(OR, 8.75; 95% CI, 1.67-45.86)).
CONCLUSIONS: The use of doxycycline is a risk factor for developing IBS and
possibly IBD when deployed to developing and developed countries respectively.
Doxycycline as a risk factor for chronic gastrointestinal illness warrants a
prospective large-scale study.

L, Matias A, Caccone A, Nseng Nchama G, Kleinschmidt I.

Medicine, London WC1E 7HT, UK.

BACKGROUND: A successful malaria control programme began in 2004 on Bioko Island,
Equatorial Guinea. From 2007, the same multiple malaria interventions, though
reduced in scope for funding reasons, were introduced to the four mainland
provinces of Equatorial Guinea (the continental region) aiming to recreate
Bioko's success. Two provinces received long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs)
and two provinces received biannual indoor residual spraying (IRS). Enhanced case
management and communications were introduced throughout.
METHODS: Estimates of intervention coverage and indicators of malaria
transmission for 2007 to 2011 were derived from annual malaria indicator surveys 
(MIS). Results were complemented by health information system (HIS) and
entomological data. The personal protection offered by LLINs and IRS against
Plasmodium falciparum infection was estimated with logistic regression.
RESULTS: The estimated proportion of children aged 1-4 using either an LLIN the
previous night or living in a house sprayed in the last six months was 23% in
2007 and 42% in 2011. The estimated prevalence of P. falciparum in children aged 
1-4 was 68% (N=1,770; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 58-76%) in 2007 and 52%
(N=1,602; 95% CI: 44-61%) in 2011. Children 1-4 years had lower prevalence if
they used an LLIN the previous night (N=1,124, 56%; adjusted odds ratio [aOR]
0.64, 95% CI: 0.55-0.74) or if they lived in a sprayed house (N=1,150, 57%; aOR
0.80, 95% CI: 0.62-1.03) compared to children with neither intervention (N=4,131,
66%, reference group). The minority of children who both used an LLIN and lived
in a sprayed house had the lowest prevalence of infection (N=171, 45%; aOR 0.52, 
95% CI: 0.35-0.78). High site-level intervention coverage did not always
correlate with lower site-level P. falciparum prevalence. The malaria season
peaked in either June or July, not necessarily coinciding with MIS data
collection.
CONCLUSIONS: Though moderate impact was achieved after five years of vector
control, case management, and communications, prevalence remained high due to an 
inability to sufficiently scale-up coverage with either IRS or LLINs. Both LLINs 
and IRS provided individual protection, but greater protection was afforded to
children who benefitted from both.

Endemic Burkitt lymphoma (eBL) is linked to Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) infection 
geographically, but evidence from individual-level studies is limited. We
investigated this issue among 354 childhood eBL cases and 384 age-, sex-, and
location-matched controls enrolled in Ghana from 1965 to 1994. Immunoglobulin G1 
(IgG1) and immunoglobulin G3 (IgG3) antibodies to antigens diagnostic of recent
infection Pf histidine-rich protein-II (HRP-II) and 6NANP, Pf-vaccine candidates 
SE36 and 42-kDa region of the 3D7 Pf merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP-1), and
tetanus toxoid were measured by indirect enzyme-linked immunoassay. Odds ratios
(ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for association with eBL were estimated 
using unconditional logistic regression. After adjustments, eBL was positively
associated with HRP-IIIgG3 seropositivity (adjusted OR: 1.60; 95% CI 1.08-2.36)
and inversely associated with SE36IgG1 seropositivity (adjusted OR: 0.37; 95% CI 
0.21-0.64) and with tetanus toxoidIgG3 levels equal or higher than the mean
(adjusted OR: 0.46; 95% CI 0.32-0.66). Anti-MSP-1IgG3 and anti-6NANPIgG3 were
indeterminate. eBL risk was potentially 21 times higher (95% CI 5.8-74) in
HRP-IIIgG3-seropositive and SE36IgG1-seronegative responders compared with
HRP-IIIgG3-seronegative and SE36IgG1-seropositive responders. Our results suggest
that recent malaria may be associated with risk of eBL but long-term infection
may be protective.

BACKGROUND: Malaria is often considered a cause of adult sepsis in malaria
endemic areas. However, diagnostic limitations can make distinction between
malaria and other infections challenging. Therefore, the objective of this study 
was to determine the relative contribution of malaria to adult sepsis in
south-western Uganda.
METHODS: Adult patients with sepsis were enrolled at the Mbarara Regional
Referral Hospital between February and May 2012. Sepsis was defined as infection 
plus ≥2 of the following: axillary temperature >37.5°C or <35.5°C, heart rate >90
or respiratory rate >20. Severe sepsis was defined as sepsis plus organ
dysfunction (blood lactate >4 mmol/L, confusion, or a systolic blood pressure <90
mmHg). Sociodemographic, clinical and laboratory data, including malaria PCR and 
rapid diagnostic tests, as well as acid fast bacteria sputum smears and blood
cultures were collected. Patients were followed until in-patient death or
discharge. The primary outcome of interest was the cause of sepsis. Multivariable
logistic regression was performed to assess predictors of mortality.
RESULTS: Enrollment included 216 participants who were 51% female with a median
age of 32 years (IQR 27-43 years). Of these, 122 (56%) subjects were
HIV-seropositive of whom 75 (66%) had a CD4+ T cell count <100 cells/μL. The
prevalence of malaria was 4% (six with Plasmodium falciparum, two with Plasmodium
vivax). Bacteraemia was identified in 41 (19%) patients. In-hospital mortality
was 19% (n = 42). In multivariable regression analysis, Glasgow Coma Score <9
(IRR 4.81, 95% CI 1.80-12.8) and severe sepsis (IRR, 2.07, 95% CI 1.03-4.14), but
no specific diagnoses were statistically associated with in-hospital mortality.
CONCLUSION: Malaria was an uncommon cause of adult sepsis in a regional referral 
hospital in south-western Uganda. In this setting, a thorough evaluation for
alternate causes of disease in patients presenting with sepsis is recommended.

PURPOSE: It is unclear why some children with falciparum malaria develop acute
seizures and what determines the phenotype of seizures. We sought to determine if
polymorphisms of malaria candidate genes are associated with acute seizures.
METHODS: Logistic regression was used to investigate genetic associations with
malaria-associated seizures (MAS) and complex MAS (repetitive, prolonged, or
focal seizures) in four MalariaGEN African sites, namely: Blantyre, Malawi;
Kilifi, Kenya; Kumasi, Ghana; and Muheza, Tanzania. The analysis was repeated for
five inheritance models (dominant, heterozygous, recessive, additive, and
general) and adjusted for potential confounders and multiple testing.
KEY FINDINGS: Complex phenotypes of seizures constituted 71% of all admissions
with MAS across the sites. MAS were strongly associated with cluster of
differentiation-ligand-rs3092945 in females in Kilifi (p = 0.00068) and
interleukin (IL)-17 receptor E-rs708567 in the pooled analysis across the sites
(p = 0.00709). Complex MAS were strongly associated with epidermal growth factor 
module-containing mucin-like hormone receptor (EMR)1-rs373533 in Kumasi (p =
0.00033), but none in the pooled analysis. Focal MAS were strongly associated
with IL-20 receptor A-rs1555498 in Muheza (p = 0.00016), but none in the pooled
analysis. Prolonged MAS were strongly associated with complement receptor
1-rs17047660 in Kilifi (p = 0.00121) and glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase-rs1050828 in females in the pooled analysis (p = 0.00155).
Repetitive MAS were strongly associated with EMR1-rs373533 in Kumasi (p =
0.00003) and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance receptor-rs17140229 in the
pooled analysis (p = 0.00543). MAS with coma/cerebral malaria were strongly
associated with EMR1-rs373533 in Kumasi (p = 0.00019) and IL10-rs3024500 in the
pooled analysis across the sites (p = 0.00064).
SIGNIFICANCE: We have identified a number of genetic associations that may
explain the risk of seizures in >2,000 cases admitted to hospitals with MAS
across four sites in Africa. These associations differed according to phenotype
of seizures and site.

BACKGROUND: In areas where visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and malaria are
co-endemic, co-infections are common. Clinical implications range from potential 
diagnostic delay to increased disease-related morbidity, as compared to VL
patients. Nevertheless, public awareness of the disease remains limited. In
VL-endemic areas with unstable and seasonal malaria, vulnerability to the disease
persists through all age-groups, suggesting that in these populations, malaria
may easily co-occur with VL, with potentially severe clinical effects.
METHODS: A retrospective case-control study was performed using medical records
of VL patients admitted to Tabarakallah and Gedarif Teaching Hospitals (Gedarif
State) and Al`Azaza kala-azar Clinic (Sennar State), Sudan (2005-2010). Patients 
positively diagnosed with VL and malaria were identified as cases, and VL
patients without microscopy-detectable malaria as controls. Associations between 
patient characteristics and the occurrence of the co-infection were investigated 
using logistic regression analysis. Confirmation of epidemiological outcomes was 
obtained with an independently collected dataset, composed by Médecins Sans
Frontières (MSF) at Um-el-Kher and Kassab Hospitals, Gedarif State (1998).
RESULTS: The prevalence of malaria co-infection among VL surveyed patients ranged
from 3.8 to 60.8%, with a median of 26.2%. Co-infected patients presented at
hospital with deteriorated clinical pictures. Emaciation (Odds Ratio (OR): 2.46; 
95% Confidence Interval (95% CI): 1.72-3.50), jaundice (OR: 2.52; 95% CI:
1.04-6.09) and moderate anemia (OR: 1.58; 95% CI: 1.10-2.28) were found to be
positively associated with the co-infection, while severity of splenomegaly (OR: 
0.53; 95% CI: 0.35-0.81) and, to a less extent, hepatomegaly (OR: 0.52; 95% CI:
0.27-1.01) appeared to be reduced by concomitant VL and malaria. The in-hospital 
case-fatality rates did not significantly differ between co- and mono-infected
patients (OR: 1.13; 95% CI: 0.59-2.17). Conversely, a significantly increased
mortality rate (OR: 4.38; 95% CI: 1.83-10.48) was observed by MSF amongst
co-infected patients enrolled at Um-el-Kher and Kassab Hospitals, who also
suffered an enhanced risk of severe anemia (OR: 3.44; 95% CI: 1.68-7.02) compared
to VL mono-infections.
CONCLUSIONS: In endemic VL areas with unstable seasonal malaria, like eastern
Sudan, VL patients are highly exposed to the risk of developing concomitant
malaria. Prompt diagnosis and effective treatment of malaria are essential to
ensure that its co-infection does not result into poor prognoses.

Gender differences in the use of insecticide-treated nets after a universal free 
distribution campaign in Kano State, Nigeria: post-campaign survey results.

BACKGROUND: Recent expansion in insecticide-treated net (ITN) distribution
strategies range from targeting pregnant women and children under five and
distributing ITN at antenatal care and immunization programmes, to providing free
distribution campaigns to cover an entire population. These changes in strategy
raise issues of disparities, such as equity of access and equality in ITN use
among different groups, including females and males. Analysis is needed to assess
the effects of gender on uptake of key malaria control interventions. A recent
post-universal free ITN distribution campaign survey in Kano State, Nigeria
offered an opportunity to look at gender effects on ITN use.
METHODS: A post-campaign survey was conducted three to five months after the
campaign in Kano State, Nigeria from 19 October to 4 November, 2009, on a random 
sample of 4,602 individuals. The survey was carried out using a questionnaire
adapted from the Malaria Indicator Survey. Using binary logistic regression,
controlling for several covariates, the authors assessed gender effects on ITN
use among individuals living in households with at least one ITN.
RESULTS: The survey showed that household ITN ownership increased more than
10-fold, from 6% before to 71% after the campaign. There was no significant
difference between the proportion of females and males living in households with 
at least one ITN. However, a higher percentage of females used ITNs compared to
males (57.2% vs 48.8%). After controlling for several covariates, females
remained more likely to use ITNs compared to males (OR: 1.5, 95% CI: 1.3-1.7).
Adolescent boys remained the least likely group to use an ITN.
CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals gender disparity in ITN use, with males less
likely to use ITNs particularly among ages 15-25 years. The uptake of the
intervention among the most at-risk group (females) is higher than males, which
may be reflective of earlier strategies for malaria interventions. Further
research is needed to identify whether gender disparities in ITN use are related 
to traditional targeting of pregnant women and children with malaria
interventions; however, results provide evidence to design gender-sensitive
messaging for universal ITN distribution campaigns to ensure that males benefit
equally from such communications and activities.

Community knowledge, attitude and practice about malaria in a low endemic setting
of Shewa Robit Town, northeastern Ethiopia.

Abate A(1), Degarege A, Erko B.

Author information: 
(1)Somali Regional State Health Office, P.O. Box 238, Jijga, Ethiopia.

BACKGROUND: Since malaria is one of the foremost public health problems in
Ethiopia, assessment of situation of the disease, and communities' knowledge and 
perceptions about malaria is necesary to institute appropriate preventive and
control measures. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess malaria prevalence
and knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) about the disease among ShewaRobit
Town community, northeastern Ethiopia.
METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Shewa Robit
Town from October to November 2011. A multi-stage random sampling technique was
used to select the study participants. A total of 425 individuals were examined
for malaria using thin and thick Giemsa stained blood film, and 284 of the
participants were interviewed to assess their KAP about malaria. Logistic
regression analysis was used to assess predictor factors for malaria prevalence.
RESULTS: All respondents had ever heard of malaria. Most of the respondents
(85.2%) attributed the cause of malaria to mosquito bite. However, some of the
respondents (>20%) mentioned lack of personal hygiene, exposure to cold weather, 
hunger, chewing maize stalk, body contact with malaria patient and flies as the
causes of malaria. Sleeping under mosquito nets, draining stagnant water and
indoor residual spraying were the most frequently mentioned malaria preventive
measures perceived and practiced by the respondents. Among 425 individuals
examined for malaria, only 2.8% were positive for Plasmodium parasites. Living in
houses made of wall without hole, sprayed with insecticide within the last 12
hours and located at a distance of greater than 500 meters from potential
mosquito breeding sites as well as knowing and using of mosquito net were
significant predictors of low malaria prevalence among the study participants.
CONCLUSIONS: A high level of knowledge about the cause, transmission and
preventive methods of malaria was detected among the community in Shewa Robit
Town. However, a considerable proportion had misconception about the cause and
transmission of malaria suggesting the necessity of health education to raise the
community's awareness about the disease.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the factors associated with HIV1 RNA plasma viral load 
(pVL) below 40 copies/mL at the third trimester of pregnancy, as part of
prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) in Benin.
DESIGN: Sub study of the PACOME clinical trial of malaria prophylaxis in
HIV-infected pregnant women, conducted before and after the implementation of the
WHO 2009 revised guidelines for PMTCT.
METHODS: HIV-infected women were enrolled in the second trimester of pregnancy.
Socio-economic characteristics, HIV history, clinical and biological
characteristics were recorded. Malaria prevention and PMTCT involving
antiretroviral therapy (ART) for mothers and infants were provided. Logistic
regression helped identifying factors associated with virologic suppression at
the end of pregnancy.
RESULTS: Overall 217 third trimester pVLs were available, and 71% showed
undetectability. Virologic suppression was more frequent in women enrolled after 
the change in PMTCT recommendations, advising to start ART at 14 weeks instead of
28 weeks of pregnancy. In multivariate analysis, Fon ethnic group (the
predominant ethnic group in the study area), regular job, first and second
pregnancy, higher baseline pVL and impaired adherence to ART were negative
factors whereas higher weight, higher antenatal care attendance and longer ART
duration were favorable factors to achieve virologic suppression.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides more evidence that ART has to be initiated
before the last trimester of pregnancy to achieve an undetectable pVL before
delivery. In Benin, new recommendations supporting early initiation were well
implemented and, together with a high antenatal care attendance, led to high rate
of virologic control.

In Sierra Leone, traditional treatment is at times used in lieu of seeking
allopathic healthcare for major illnesses causing child death. This paper
describes the nature of traditional treatment for diarrhea and fever (presumed
malaria). Weighted analysis and multi-logistic regression was applied to a
household cluster survey (n=5951) conducted in 4 districts in June 2010. Using
structured questionnaires, heads of households, and caregivers of children under 
five years of age were interviewed about child morbidity and care seeking. A
thematic analysis of qualitative data based on focus group discussions and
in-depth interviews with family members from twelve villages in these same four
districts, was also done. Illness-specific herbal remedies were described by
respondents. Among 1511 children with diarrhea, 31% used traditional treatment.
Among 3851 children with fever, 22% used traditional treatment. Traditional
treatment for diarrhea was associated with being from a tribe other than the
Mende, using government recommended salt sugar solution, not having a vaccine
card, having more than two illnesses, and not seeking any allopathic medical
treatment for diarrhea. For fever, traditional treatment was associated with
being a tribe other than the Mende, having more than two illnesses, not having a 
vaccine card, Muslim religion, and not seeking any allopathic medical treatment
for fever. Qualitatively, respondents describe herbalists as trusted with
remedies that are seen to be appropriate due to the perceived cause of illness
and due to barriers to seeking care from government providers. The social
determinants of traditional treatment use and the prominent role of herbalists in
providing them need to be addressed to improve child survival in Sierra Leone.

In holoendemic Plasmodium falciparum transmission areas such as western Kenya,
severe malarial anemia [SMA, hemoglobin (Hb) < 6.0 g/dL, with any density
parasitemia] is the most common clinical manifestation of severe malaria
resulting in high rates of pediatric morbidity and mortality in these regions.
Previous studies associated interleukin (IL)-13 with pathogenesis of different
infectious diseases, including P. falciparum malaria. However, the functional
roles of polymorphic variants within the IL-13 promoter in conditioning
susceptibility to SMA remain largely unexplored. As such, the association between
the IL-13 variants -7402 T/G (rs7719175) and -4729G/A (rs3091307) and
susceptibility to SMA was determined in children (n = 387) presenting with
clinical symptoms of falciparum malaria and resident in a holoendemic
transmission region in western Kenya. Our results indicated no difference in the 
proportions of individual genotypes among children presenting with non-SMA (n =
222) versus SMA (n = 165). Similarly, there was no associations between the
individual genotypes (-7402 T/G and -4729G/A) and SMA. Additional analyses,
however, revealed that proportions of individuals with -7402 T/-4729A (TA)
haplotype was significantly higher in children presenting with SMA than non-SMA
group (P = 0.043). A further multivariate logistic regression analyses,
controlling for confounding factors, demonstrated that carriage of the TA
haplotype was associated with increased susceptibility to SMA (OR; 1.564, 95% CI;
1.023-2.389, P = 0.039). In addition, circulating levels of IL-13 were comparable
between the clinical groups as well as across genotypes and haplotypes.
Collectively, findings presented here suggest that haplotypes within the IL-13
promoter at -7402 T/G and -4729G/A may modulate SMA pathogenesis, but do not
affect circulating IL-13 levels.

Hospital, Ituku-Ozalla, Enugu, Nigeria.

INTRODUCTION: Malaria and hookworm infections are common in sub-Saharan Africa
and they increase the prevalence of anaemia in pregnancy with resultant poor
pregnancy outcomes. This study was carried out to assess the impact of Plasmodium
falciparum and hookworm infections on the frequency of anaemia among pregnant
women in two rural communities in Enugu, South East Nigeria.
METHODS: A cross sectional descriptive study was carried out in a total of 226
women attending antenatal clinics at two rural Primary Health Centres (PHC) from 
April 2011 to July 2011(each PHC with 113 subjects). Socio-demographic data were 
collected through a structured questionnaire. Blood and stool samples were
evaluated for haemoglobin estimation and malaria parasites, and stool samples
examined for parasitic infection in all the women. Data was analyzed using STATA 
10 software statistical analysis package. Student t-test was used for comparing
mean values and chi square test for comparing categorical variables and level of 
significance set at p<0.05 and logistic regression was used to identify the risk 
factors associated with malaria in pregnancy.
RESULTS: The mean age of the women was 27 years with range 18-38 years and SD of 
5 years. Most of the women were housewives and over 50% in their second
trimester. 53% of them had malaria parasites while 27% had hookworm infection.
About 40% of the women were anaemic (haemoglobin<0.001). Similar association was 
found between hookworm infection and anaemia (p<0.001). Though both malaria and
hookworm infections greatly increase the odds for anaemia (AOR 18.06, CI 18.15
-39.99, P<0.001) and (AOR 5.28, CI 2.26-12.38, P<0.001) respectively, the odds
for having anaemia in pregnancy was higher for malaria than hookworm infections.
CONCLUSION: Plasmodium falciparum and hookworm infections have significant impact
on the high frequency of anaemia in pregnancy in our rural communities. There is 
need to strengthen the control program that has been in place with an integrated 
intervention to combat these parasitic infections in our rural communities, with 
mass distribution of antihelminthics as one of the included relevant methods,
among others.

BACKGROUND: Malaria is the commonest imported infection in the UK. Malaria
requiring ICU admission has a reported mortality of up to 25%. The relationship
between ethnicity, immunity, and risk of malaria is complex. The Malaria Score
for Adults (MSA) and Coma Acidosis Malaria (CAM) score have recently been
proposed to risk stratify patients with malaria.
METHODS: Retrospective study of patients with WHO severe falciparum malaria
admitted to ICU at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, London, UK. The
relationship between clinical variables and risk of death or a prolonged ICU stay
were examined with logistic regression. The predictive value of the MSA and CAM
score were calculated.
RESULTS: 124 patients were included. Cerebral malaria and acute kidney injury
occurred earlier (median day 1) than acute respiratory distress syndrome (median 
day 3). Six patients had community acquired bacterial co-infection. Eight
patients were co-infected with HIV, five of whom were newly diagnosed. The
positive predictive value of a CAM score ≥2 or an MSA ≥5 for death were 12% and
22% respectively. Five patients died. No variable was significantly associated
with risk of death. There were no significant differences between individuals
raised in endemic countries compared to non-endemic countries.
CONCLUSIONS: Mortality in patients managed in a specialist centre was low.
Patients who died succumbed to complications associated with a prolonged stay on 
ICU rather than malaria per se. The clinical usefulness of the MSA and CAM score 
was limited. Co-infection with HIV was relatively common but compared to studies 
in children, bacteraemia was uncommon. The relationship between ethnicity and
immunity to severe disease is complex.

We conducted a retrospective study of patients with severe falciparum malaria to 
determine factors associated with malarial acute renal failure (MARF). We
reviewed 262 medical records of adults hospitalized with severe falciparum
malaria in Thailand from 2004 to 2008. The incidence of MARF in our study
population was 44% (115/262); 75% (86/115) of these had MARF on admission and 25%
(29/115) developed MARF during hospitalization. The majority of MARF patients
presented in a hypercatabolic state (62%, 68/109) and were non-oliguric (48%,
55/115) or oliguric (44%, 51/115). Forty-six percent of MARF patients (53/115)
required renal replacement therapy for a median duration of 4.5 days. Patients
with MARF had significantly higher complication rates (p < 0.001), longer
duration of hospitalization (p < 0.001) and a higher case fatality rate (p =
0.001). Using stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis by backward
selection method, factors associated with MARF were advanced age [odds ratios
(OR); 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.037 (1.011-1.063), p = 0.005], being,
referred from another hospital [2.876 (1.447-5.714), p = 0.003], an elevated
total bilirubin level [(1.168 (1.101-1.241), p < 0.001], requiring inotropic
drugs [4.879 (2.255-10.557), p < 0.001] and developing a hospital acquired
infection [3.425; 1.406-8.343, p = 0.007]. Clinicians should be aware of these
factors associated with MARF.

BACKGROUND: To plan for a community case management (CCM) program after the
implementation of the Free Health Care Initiative (FHCI), we assessed health care
seeking for children with diarrhoea, malaria and pneumonia in 4 poor rural
districts in Sierra Leone.
METHODS: In July 2010 we undertook a cross-sectional household cluster survey and
qualitative research. Caregivers of children under five years of age were
interviewed about healthcare seeking. We evaluated the association of various
factors with not seeking health care by obtaining adjusted odds ratios and 95%
confidence limits using a multivariable logistic regression model. Focus groups
and in-depth interviews of young mothers, fathers and older caregivers in 12
villages explored household recognition and response to child morbidity.
RESULTS: The response rate was 93% (n=5951). Over 85% of children were brought
for care for all conditions. However, 10.8% of those with diarrhoea, 36.5% of
those with presumed pneumonia and 41.0% of those with fever did not receive
recommended treatment. In the multivariable models, use of traditional treatments
was significantly associated with not seeking outside care for all three
conditions. Qualitative data showed that traditional treatments were used due to 
preferences for locally available treatments and barriers to facility care that
remain even after FHCI.
CONCLUSION: We found high healthcare seeking rates soon after the FHCI; however, 
many children do not receive recommended treatment, and some are given
traditional treatment instead of seeking outside care. Facility care needs to be 
improved and the CCM program should target those few children still not accessing
care.

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of epilepsy in sub-Saharan Africa seems to be higher
than in other parts of the world, but estimates vary substantially for unknown
reasons. We assessed the prevalence and risk factors of active convulsive
epilepsy across five centres in this region.
METHODS: We did large population-based cross-sectional and case-control studies
in five Health and Demographic Surveillance System centres: Kilifi, Kenya (Dec 3,
2007-July 31, 2008); Agincourt, South Africa (Aug 4, 2008-Feb 27, 2009);
Iganga-Mayuge, Uganda (Feb 2, 2009-Oct 30, 2009); Ifakara, Tanzania (May 4,
2009-Dec 31, 2009); and Kintampo, Ghana (Aug 2, 2010-April 29, 2011). We used a
three-stage screening process to identify people with active convulsive epilepsy.
Prevalence was estimated as the ratio of confirmed cases to the population
screened and was adjusted for sensitivity and attrition between stages. For each 
case, an age-matched control individual was randomly selected from the relevant
centre's census database. Fieldworkers masked to the status of the person they
were interviewing administered questionnaires to individuals with active
convulsive epilepsy and control individuals to assess sociodemographic variables 
and historical risk factors (perinatal events, head injuries, and diet). Blood
samples were taken from a randomly selected subgroup of 300 participants with
epilepsy and 300 control individuals from each centre and were screened for
antibodies to Toxocara canis, Toxoplasma gondii, Onchocerca volvulus, Plasmodium 
falciparum, Taenia solium, and HIV. We estimated odds ratios (ORs) with logistic 
regression, adjusted for age, sex, education, employment, and marital status.
RESULTS: 586,607 residents in the study areas were screened in stage one, of whom
1711 were diagnosed as having active convulsive epilepsy. Prevalence adjusted for
attrition and sensitivity varied between sites: 7·8 per 1000 people (95% CI
7·5-8·2) in Kilifi, 7·0 (6·2-7·4) in Agincourt, 10·3 (9·5-11·1) in Iganga-Mayuge,
14·8 (13·8-15·4) in Ifakara, and 10·1 (9·5-10·7) in Kintampo. The 1711
individuals with the disorder and 2032 control individuals were given
questionnaires. In children (aged <18 years), the greatest relative increases in 
prevalence were associated with difficulties feeding, crying, or breathing after 
birth (OR 10·23, 95% CI 5·85-17·88; p<0·0001); abnormal antenatal periods (2·15, 
1·53-3·02; p<0·0001); and head injury (1·97, 1·28-3·03; p=0·002). In adults (aged
≥18 years), the disorder was significantly associated with admission to hospital 
with malaria or fever (2·28, 1·06-4·92; p=0·036), exposure to T canis (1·74,
1·27-2·40; p=0·0006), exposure to T gondii (1·39, 1·05-1·84; p=0·021), and
exposure to O volvulus (2·23, 1·56-3·19; p<0·0001). Hypertension (2·13,
1·08-4·20; p=0·029) and exposure to T solium (7·03, 2·06-24·00; p=0·002) were
risk factors for adult-onset disease.
INTERPRETATION: The prevalence of active convulsive epilepsy varies in
sub-Saharan Africa and that the variation is probably a result of differences in 
risk factors. Programmes to control parasitic diseases and interventions to
improve antenatal and perinatal care could substantially reduce the prevalence of
epilepsy in this region.

Malaria remains a challenging diagnosis with variable clinical presentation and a
wide spectrum of disease severity. Using a structured case report form, we
prospectively assessed 1,933 children at Mulago Hospital in Kampala, Uganda with 
acute Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Children with uncomplicated malaria
significantly differed from those with severe disease for 17 features. Among 855 
children with severe disease, the case-fatality rate increased as the number of
severity features increased. Logistic regression identified five factors
independently associated with death: cerebral malaria, hypoxia, severe
thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis, and lactic acidosis. Cluster analysis identified 
two groups: one combining anemia, splenomegaly, and leukocytosis; and a second
group centered on death, severe thrombocytopenia, and lactic acidosis, which
included cerebral malaria, hypoxia, hypoglycemia, and hyper-parasitemia. Our
report updates previous clinical descriptions of severe malaria, quantifies
significant clinical and laboratory inter-relationships, and will assist
clinicians treating malaria and those planning or assessing future research
(NCT00707200) (www.clinicaltrials.gov).

BACKGROUND: Chloroquine (CQ) was the main malaria therapy worldwide from the
1940s until the 1990s. Following the emergence of CQ-resistant Plasmodium
falciparum, most African countries discontinued the use of CQ, and now promote
artemisinin-based combination therapy as the first-line treatment. This change
was generally initiated during the last decade in West and Central Africa. The
aim of this study is to describe the changes in CQ susceptibility in this African
region, using travellers returning from this region as a sentinel system.
METHODS: The study was conducted by the Malaria National Reference Centre,
France. The database collated the pfcrtK76T molecular marker for CQ
susceptibility and the in vitro response to CQ of parasites from travellers'
isolates returning from Senegal, Mali, Ivory Coast or Cameroon. As a proxy of
drug pressure, data regarding CQ intake in febrile children were collated for the
study period. Logistic regression models were used to detect trends in the
proportions of CQ resistant isolates.
RESULTS: A total of 2874 parasite isolates were genotyped between 2000-2011. The 
prevalence of the pfcrt76T mutant genotype significantly decreased for Senegal
(from 78% to 47%), Ivory Coast (from 63% to 37%), Cameroon (from 90% to 59%) and 
remained stable for Mali. The geometric mean of the 50% inhibitory concentration 
(IC50) of CQ in vitro susceptibility and the proportion of resistant isolates
(defining resistance as an IC50 value > 100 nM) significantly decreased for
Senegal (from 86 nM (59%) to 39 nM (25%)), Mali (from 84 nM (50%) to 51 nM
(31%)), Ivory Coast (from 75 nM (59%) to 29 nM (16%)) and Cameroon (from 181 nM
(75%) to 51 nM (37%)). Both analyses (molecular and in vitro susceptibility) were
performed for the 2004-2011 period, after the four countries had officially
discontinued CQ and showed an accelerated decline of the resistant isolates for
the four countries. Meanwhile, CQ use among children significantly deceased in
this region (fixed effects slope = -0.3, p < 10-3).
CONCLUSIONS: An increase in CQ susceptibility following official withdrawal of
the drug was observed in travellers returning from West and Central African
countries. The same trends were observed for molecular and in vitro analysis
between 2004-2011 and they correlated to the decrease of the drug pressure.

Health status and preventative behaviors of immigrants by gender and origin: a
Portuguese cross-sectional study.

Tropical Diseases, New University of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal.

Migration has been associated with a greater vulnerability in health. Migrants,
especially women, go through several experiences during the migration process and
in the host countries that ultimately put their health at risk. This study
examines self-reported health status and preventive behaviors among female and
male immigrants in Portugal, and identifies sociodemographic and behavioral
factors underlying gender differences. A sample of 1375 immigrants (51.1% women) 
was studied. Data were analyzed through logistic regression. Good health status
was reported by 66.7% of men and by 56.6% of women (P < 0.001). Gender
differences were also found across preventative behaviors. Among women and men,
reported good health was associated with younger age, African and Brazilian
origin (compared to Eastern European), secondary/higher education, no chronic
disease, and concern about eating habits. Among women, good health was also
associated with perceived sufficient income, no experience of mental illness, and
regular physical exercise. When developing health programs to improve immigrants'
health, special attention must be given to existing gender inequalities, and
socioeconomic and cultural context, in accordance with their experience of living
in the host country over time.

BACKGROUND: Pregnancy associated malaria is associated with decreased birth
weight, but in-utero evaluation of fetal growth alterations is rarely performed. 
The objective of this study was to investigate malaria induced changes in fetal
growth during the 3(rd) trimester using trans-abdominal ultrasound.
METHODS: An observational study of 876 pregnant women (398 primi- and
secundigravidae and 478 multigravidae) was conducted in Tanzania. Fetal growth
was monitored with ultrasound and screening for malaria was performed regularly. 
Birth weight and fetal weight were converted to z-scores, and fetal growth
evaluated as fetal weight gain from the 26th week of pregnancy.
RESULTS: Malaria infection only affected birth weight and fetal growth among
primi- and secundigravid women. Forty-eight of the 398 primi- and secundigravid
women had malaria during pregnancy causing a reduction in the newborns z-score of
-0.50 (95% CI: -0.86, -0.13, P = 0.008, multiple linear regression). Fifty-eight 
percent (28/48) of the primi- and secundigravidae had malaria in the first half
of pregnancy, but an effect on fetal growth was observed in the 3(rd) trimester
with an OR of 4.89 for the fetal growth rate belonging to the lowest 25% in the
population (95%CI: 2.03-11.79, P<0.001, multiple logistic regression). At an
individual level, among the primi- and secundigravidae, 27% experienced
alterations of fetal growth immediately after exposure but only for a short
interval, 27% only late in pregnancy, 16.2% persistently from exposure until the 
end of pregnancy, and 29.7% had no alterations of fetal growth.
CONCLUSIONS: The effect of malaria infections was observed during the 3(rd)
trimester, despite infections occurring much earlier in pregnancy, and different 
mechanisms might operate leading to different patterns of growth alterations.
This study highlights the need for protection against malaria throughout
pregnancy and the recognition that observed changes in fetal growth might be a
consequence of an infection much earlier in pregnancy.

BACKGROUND: Identification of malaria vector breeding sites can enhance control
activities. Although associations between malaria vector breeding sites and
topography are well recognized, practical models that predict breeding sites from
topographic information are lacking. We used topographic variables derived from
remotely sensed Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) to model the breeding sites of
malaria vectors. We further compared the predictive strength of two different
DEMs and evaluated the predictability of various habitat types inhabited by
Anopheles larvae.
METHODS: Using GIS techniques, topographic variables were extracted from two
DEMs: 1) Shuttle Radar Topography Mission 3 (SRTM3, 90-m resolution) and 2) the
Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission Reflection Radiometer Global DEM (ASTER,
30-m resolution). We used data on breeding sites from an extensive field survey
conducted on an island in western Kenya in 2006. Topographic variables were
extracted for 826 breeding sites and for 4520 negative points that were randomly 
assigned. Logistic regression modelling was applied to characterize topographic
features of the malaria vector breeding sites and predict their locations. Model 
accuracy was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating
characteristics curve (AUC).
RESULTS: All topographic variables derived from both DEMs were significantly
correlated with breeding habitats except for the aspect of SRTM. The magnitude
and direction of correlation for each variable were similar in the two DEMs.
Multivariate models for SRTM and ASTER showed similar levels of fit indicated by 
Akaike information criterion (3959.3 and 3972.7, respectively), though the former
was slightly better than the latter. The accuracy of prediction indicated by AUC 
was also similar in SRTM (0.758) and ASTER (0.755) in the training site. In the
testing site, both SRTM and ASTER models showed higher AUC in the testing sites
than in the training site (0.829 and 0.799, respectively). The predictability of 
habitat types varied. Drains, foot-prints, puddles and swamp habitat types were
most predictable.
CONCLUSIONS: Both SRTM and ASTER models had similar predictive potentials, which 
were sufficiently accurate to predict vector habitats. The free availability of
these DEMs suggests that topographic predictive models could be widely used by
vector control managers in Africa to complement malaria control strategies.

BACKGROUND: Over the past 20 years, numerous studies have investigated the
ecology and behaviour of malaria vectors and Plasmodium falciparum malaria
transmission on the coast of Kenya. Substantial progress has been made to control
vector populations and reduce high malaria prevalence and severe disease. The
goal of this paper was to examine trends over the past 20 years in Anopheles
species composition, density, blood-feeding behaviour, and P. falciparum
sporozoite transmission along the coast of Kenya.
METHODS: Using data collected from 1990 to 2010, vector density, species
composition, blood-feeding patterns, and malaria transmission intensity was
examined along the Kenyan coast. Mosquitoes were identified to species, based on 
morphological characteristics and DNA extracted from Anopheles gambiae for
amplification. Using negative binomial generalized estimating equations, mosquito
abundance over the period were modelled while adjusting for season. A multiple
logistic regression model was used to analyse the sporozoite rates.
RESULTS: Results show that in some areas along the Kenyan coast, Anopheles
arabiensis and Anopheles merus have replaced An. gambiae sensu stricto (s.s.) and
Anopheles funestus as the major mosquito species. Further, there has been a shift
from human to animal feeding for both An. gambiae sensu lato (s.l.) (99% to 16%) 
and An. funestus (100% to 3%), and P. falciparum sporozoite rates have
significantly declined over the last 20 years, with the lowest sporozoite rates
being observed in 2007 (0.19%) and 2008 (0.34%). There has been, on average, a
significant reduction in the abundance of An. gambiae s.l. over the years
(IRR = 0.94, 95% CI 0.90-0.98), with the density standing at low levels of an
average 0.006 mosquitoes/house in the year 2010.
CONCLUSION: Reductions in the densities of the major malaria vectors and a shift 
from human to animal feeding have contributed to the decreased burden of malaria 
along the Kenyan coast. Vector species composition remains heterogeneous but in
many areas An. arabiensis has replaced An. gambiae as the major malaria vector.
This has important implications for malaria epidemiology and control given that
this vector predominately rests and feeds on humans outdoors. Strategies for
vector control need to continue focusing on tools for protecting residents inside
houses but additionally employ outdoor control tools because these are essential 
for further reducing the levels of malaria transmission.

BACKGROUND: Many studies have explored the risk perception of frequent business
travelers (FBT) toward malaria. However, less is known about their knowledge of
other infectious diseases. This study aimed to identify knowledge gaps by
determining the risk perception of FBT toward 11 infectious diseases.
METHODS: Our retrospective web-based survey assessed the accuracy of risk
perception among a defined cohort of FBT for 11 infectious diseases. We used
logistic regression and the chi-square test to determine the association of risk 
perception with source of travel advice, demographic variables, and features of
trip preparation.
RESULTS: Surveys were returned by 63% of the 608 self-registered FBT in Rijswijk,
and only the 328 completed questionnaires that adhered to our inclusion criteria 
were used for analysis. The majority (71%) sought pre-travel health advice and
used a company health source (83%). Participants seeking company travel health
advice instead of external had significantly more accurate risk knowledge
(p = 0.03), but more frequently overestimated typhoid risk (odds ratio = 2.03;
95% confidence interval = 1.23-3.34). While underestimation of disease risk was
on average 23% more common than overestimation, HIV risk was overestimated by 75%
of FBT.
CONCLUSIONS: More accurate knowledge among FBT seeking company health advice
demonstrates that access to in-company travel clinics can improve risk
perception. However, there is an obvious need for risk knowledge improvement,
given the overall underestimation of risk. The substantial overestimation of HIV 
risk is probably due to both public and in-company awareness efforts. Conversely,
typhoid risk overestimation was statistically associated with seeking company
health advice, and therefore specifically reflects the high focus on typhoid
fever within Shell's travel clinic. This study serves as a reminder that a
knowledge gap toward infectious diseases besides malaria still exists. Our
article will explore the future requirements for more targeted education and
research among FBT in companies worldwide.

Although malaria is declining in many countries in Africa, malaria and anaemia
remain frequent in children. This study was conducted to assess the relationship 
between malaria parasitaemia, intestinal worms, and anaemia, in children <5 years
living in low transmission area in Senegal. A survey was carried out in 30
villages in the central part of Senegal. A two-level random cluster sampling
technique was used to select study participant. Children <5 years were enrolled
after informed consent. For each child, blood thick and smear tests were
performed, haemoglobin concentration was measured with HemoCue, and stool samples
were collected and examined using the Ritchie technique. A total of 736 children 
were recruited. Malaria parasite prevalence was 1.5% (0.7-2.6); anaemia was found
in 53.4% (48.2-58.9), while intestinal parasites and stunting represented 26.2%
(22.6-30.2) and 22% (18.6-25.5), respectively. In a logistic regression analysis,
anaemia was significantly associated with malaria parasitaemia (aOR= 6.3
(1.5-53.5)) and stunting (aOR = 2 (1.2-3.1)); no association was found between
intestinal parasites and anaemia. Malaria and anaemia remain closely associated
even when malaria is declining. Scaling up antimalarial interventions may
contribute to eliminate malaria and reduce the occurrence of anaemia among
children.

Calgary, 3330 Hospital Drive NW, Calgary AB, T2N 4N1, Canada.

Misdiagnosis of malaria is a major problem in Africa leading not only to
incorrect individual level treatment, but potentially the acceleration of the
spread of drug resistance in low-transmission areas. In this paper we report on
the outcomes of a simple intervention that utilized a social entrepreneurship
approach (SEA) to reduce misdiagnosis associated with hospital-based microscopy
of malaria in a low-transmission area of rural Tanzania. A pre-post assessment
was conducted on patients presenting to the hospital outpatient department with
malaria and non-malaria like symptoms in January 2009 (pre-intervention) and June
2009 (post-intervention). All participants were asked a health seeking behavior
questionnaire and blood samples were taken for local and quality control
microscopy. Multivariate logistic regression was conducted to determine magnitude
of misdiagnosis with local microscopy pre- versus- post intervention. Local
microscopy pre-intervention specificity was 29.5% (95% CI = 21.6% - 38.4%)
whereas the post intervention specificity was 68.6% (95% CI = 60.2% - 76.2%).
Both pre and post intervention sensitivity were difficult to determine due to an 
unexpected low number of true positive cases. The proportion of participants
misdiagnosed pre-intervention was 70.2% (95%CI = 61.3%-78.0%) as compared to
30.6% (95%CI = 23.2%-38.8%) post-intervention. This resulted in a 39.6% reduction
in misdiagnosis of malaria at the local hospital. The magnitude of misdiagnosis
for the pre-intervention participants was 5.3 (95%CI = 3.1-9.3) that of the
post-intervention participants. In conclusion, this study provides evidence that 
a simple intervention can meaningfully reduce the magnitude of microscopy-based
misdiagnosis of malaria for those individuals seeking treatment for uncomplicated
malaria. We anticipate that this intervention will facilitate a valuable and
sustainable change in malaria diagnosis at the local hospital.

BACKGROUND: Malaria, malnutrition and anaemia are major causes of morbidity and
mortality in African children. The interplay between these conditions is complex 
and limited data exist on factors associated with these conditions among infants 
born to HIV-uninfected and infected women.
METHODS: Two hundred HIV-exposed (HIV-uninfected infants born to HIV-infected
mothers) and 400 HIV-unexposed infants were recruited from an area of high
malaria transmission in rural Uganda. A cross-sectional survey was performed at
enrolment to measure the prevalence of malaria parasitaemia, measures of
malnutrition (z-scores <2 standard deviations below mean) and anaemia
(haemoglobin <8 gm/dL). Multivariate logistic regression was used to measure
associations between these conditions and risk factors of interest including
household demographics, malaria prevention practices, breastfeeding practices,
household structure and wealth index.
RESULTS: The prevalence of malaria parasitaemia was 20%. Factors protective
against parasitaemia included female gender (OR = 0.66, p = 0.047), mother's age 
(OR = 0.81 per five-year increase, p = 0.01), reported bed net use (OR = 0.63,
p = 0.03) and living in a well-constructed house (OR = 0.25, p = 0.01). Although 
HIV-unexposed infants had a higher risk of parasitaemia compared to HIV-exposed
infants (24% vs 14%, p = 0.004), there was no significant association between
HIV-exposure status and parasitaemia after controlling for the use of malaria
preventative measures including bed net use and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole
prophylaxis. The prevalence of stunting, underweight, and wasting were 10%, 7%,
and 3%, respectively. HIV-exposed infants had a higher odds of stunting
(OR = 2.23, p = 0.005), underweight (OR = 1.73, p = 0.09) and wasting (OR = 3.29,
p = 0.02). The prevalence of anaemia was 12%. Risk factors for anaemia included
older infant age (OR = 2.05 per one month increase, p = 0.003) and having malaria
parasitaemia (OR = 5.74, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Compared to HIV-unexposed infants, HIV-exposed infants had a higher 
use of malaria preventative measures and lower odds of malaria parasitaemia.
Having a better constructed house was also protective against malaria
parasitaemia. HIV-exposure was the primary risk factor for measures of
malnutrition. The primary risk factor for anaemia was malaria parasitaemia. These
findings suggest the need to better target existing interventions for malaria,
malnutrition and anaemia as well as the need to explore further the mechanisms
behind the observed associations.

BACKGROUND: The national Global Fund-supported malaria (GFM) program in Thailand,
which focuses on the household-level implementation of vector control via
insecticide-treated nets (ITNs)/long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) combined
with indoor residual spraying (IRS), has been combating malaria risk situations
in different provinces with complex epidemiological settings. By using the
perception of malaria villagers (MVs), defined as villagers who recognized
malaria burden and had local understanding of mosquitoes, malaria, and ITNs/LLINs
and practiced preventive measures, this study investigated the predictors for
malaria that are associated with rubber plantations in an area of high
household-level implementation coverage of IRS (2007-2010) and ITNs/LLINs
(2008-2010) in Prachuap Khiri Khan Province.
METHODS: A structured questionnaire addressing socio-demographics, household
characteristics and health behavioral factors (knowledge, perceptions and
practices) regarding the performed interventions was administered to the 313
households (70 malaria-affected and 243 malaria-unaffected) that had respondents 
aged ≥18 years of both genders. In the univariate and multivariate analyses, only
246 (78.6%) MV respondents (62 malaria-affected and 184 malaria-unaffected) were 
analyzed to determine the predictors for risk (morbidity).
RESULTS: The majority (70%) of households were covered by IRS. For a combination 
of ITNs/LLINs, there were 74% of malaria-affected households covered and 46% of
malaria-unaffected households. In a logistic regression analysis using odds
ratios (aORs) adjusted on the variables and a 95% confidence interval (CI),
malaria affecting MVs was associated with daily worker (i.e., earning daily
income by normally practicing laborious activities mostly in agriculture such as 
rubber tapping and rubber sheet processing at the smallholdings of rubber
plantations) (aOR = 2.9, 95% CI: 1.1-7.4), low-moderate level of malaria
knowledge (aOR = 2.4, 95% CI: 1.1-5.0) and sleeping under mosquito-nets
(nets/ITNs/LLINs intermittently and ITNs/LLINs only) (aOR = 2.0, 95% CI:
1.0-3.7).
CONCLUSIONS: The MV predictors for malaria-association with rubber plantations
included occupation (daily worker), misconceptions about malaria (mosquito and
prevention) and the use of mosquito-nets. Human practices such as revisiting
rubber plantations while exposed to multiple bites at multiple locations are more
likely to apply to daily workers than to rubber farmers/tappers and others. The
promotion and use of ITNs/LLINs depends substantially on cultural factors and
defensive behaviors relevant to their occupational risk despite the perceived
threats of malaria and the perceived benefits of ITNs/LLINs. This information
supports the conclusion that GFM program implementation in Thailand or elsewhere 
for malaria-associated with rubber plantations would benefit from the potential
use of ITNs/LLINs and changes in personal protection behaviors.

Malaria has been a heavy social and health burden in the remote and poor areas in
southern China. Analyses of malaria epidemic patterns can uncover important
features of malaria transmission. This study identified spatial clusters,
seasonal patterns, and geographic variations of malaria deaths at a county level 
in Yunnan, China, during 1991-2010. A discrete Poisson model was used to identify
purely spatial clusters of malaria deaths. Logistic regression analysis was
performed to detect changes in geographic patterns. The results show that malaria
mortality had declined in Yunnan over the study period and the most likely
spatial clusters (relative risk [RR] = 23.03-32.06, P < 0.001) of malaria deaths 
were identified in western Yunnan along the China-Myanmar border. The highest
risk of malaria deaths occurred in autumn (RR = 58.91, P < 0.001) and summer (RR 
= 31.91, P < 0.001). The results suggested that the geographic distribution of
malaria deaths was significantly changed with longitude, which indicated there
was decreased mortality of malaria in eastern areas over the last two decades,
although there was no significant change in latitude during the same period.
Public health interventions should target populations in western Yunnan along
border areas, especially focusing on floating populations crossing international 
borders.

BACKGROUND: In Southeast Asia, data on malaria treatment-seeking behaviours and
related affecting factors are rare. The population of the Wa ethnic in Myanmar
has difficulty in accessing formal health care. To understand malaria
treatment-seeking behaviour and household-affecting factors of the Wa people, a
cross-sectional study carried out in Shan Special Region II, Myanmar.
METHODS: The two methods, questionnaire-based household surveys to household
heads and in-depth interviews to key informants, were carried out independently. 
The proportion of treatment-seeking patterns was calculated. Logistic regression 
was used to determine affecting factors of treatment-seeking. Qualitative data
were analysed by using Text Analysis Markup System.
RESULTS: Overall, 87.5% of the febrile population sought treatment, but only
32.0% did so within 24 hours. The proportion accessing the retail sector (79.6%) 
was statistically significant higher (P<0.0001) than accessing the public sector 
(10.6%). Multivariable logistic regression analysis identified family income,
distances from a health facility, family decision and patient characteristics
being independently associated with delayed malaria treatment.
CONCLUSION: Malaria treatment-seeking behaviour is not appropriate, and affecting
factors include health service systems, social and cultural factors in Wa State
of Myanmar.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the burden of maternal malaria and HIV among pregnant women 
in Ghana and to determine the risk of anemia among women with dual infection.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted at 4 hospitals in the
Sekondi-Takoradi metropolis, Ghana. The study group comprised 872 consenting
pregnant women attending prenatal care clinics. Venous blood samples were
screened for malaria, HIV, and hemoglobin level. Multivariate logistic regression
analysis was performed to determine the association between malaria, HIV, and
risk of anemia.
RESULTS: In all, 34.4% of the study cohort had anemia. Multivariate logistic
regression analysis indicated that pregnant women with either malaria (odds ratio
1.99; 95% confidence interval, 1.43-2.77; P=<0.001) or HIV (odds ratio 1.78; 95% 
confidence interval, 1.13-2.80; P=0.014) had an increased risk of anemia. In
adjusted models, pregnant women co-infected with both malaria and HIV displayed
twice the risk of anemia. The adjusted odds ratio was 2.67 (95% confidence
interval, 1.44-4.97; P=0.002).
CONCLUSION: Pregnant women infected with both malaria and HIV are twice as likely
to be anemic than women with a single infection or no infection. Measures to
control malaria, HIV, and anemia during pregnancy are imperative to improve birth
outcomes in this region of Ghana.

BACKGROUND: Formerly known as a hypoendemic malaria country, the Republic of
Djibouti declared the goal of pre-eliminating malaria in 2006. The aim of the
present study was to evaluate the prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium
vivax and mixed infections in the Djiboutian population by using serological
tools and to identify potential determinants of the disease and hotspots of
malaria transmission within the country.
METHODS: The prevalence of P. falciparum and P. vivax within the districts of the
capital city and the rest of the Republic of Djibouti were assessed using 13 and 
2 serological markers, respectively. The relationship between the immune humeral 
response to P. falciparum and P. vivax and variables such as age, gender, wealth 
status, urbanism, educational level, distance to rivers/lakes, living area,
having fever in the last month, and staying in a malaria-endemic country more
than one year was estimated and analysed by questionnaires administered to 1910
Djiboutians. Multivariate ordinal logistic regression models of the immune
humeral response were obtained for P. falciparum and P. vivax.
RESULTS: The P. falciparum and P. vivax seroprevalence rates were 31.5%, CI95%
[29.4-33.7] and 17.5%, CI95% [15.8-19.3], respectively. Protective effects
against P. falciparum and P. vivax were female gender, educational level, and
never having visited a malaria-endemic area for more than one year. For P.
falciparum only, a protective effect was observed for not having a fever in the
last month, living more than 1.5 km away from lakes and rivers, and younger ages.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study that assessed the seroprevalence of P. vivax
in the Republic of Djibouti. It is necessary to improve knowledge of this
pathogen in order to create an effective elimination programme. As supported by
recent observations on the subject, the Republic of Djibouti has probably
demonstrated a real decrease in the transmission of P. falciparum in the past
seven years, which should encourage authorities to improve efforts toward
elimination.

To evaluate the sustainability of market-based community distribution of
micronutrient powders (Sprinkles(®), Hexagon Nutrition, Mumbai, India.) among
pre-school children in Kenya, we conducted in August 2010 a follow-up survey, 18 
months after study-related marketing and household monitoring ended. We surveyed 
849 children aged 6-35 months randomly selected from 60 study villages.
Nutritional biomarkers were measured by fingerstick; demographic characteristics,
Sprinkles purchases and use were assessed through household questionnaires. We
compared Sprinkles use, marketing efforts and biomarker levels with the data from
surveys conducted in March 2007, March 2008 and March 2009. We used logistic
regression to evaluate associations between marketing activities and Sprinkles
use in the 2010 survey. At the 2010 follow-up, 21.9% of children used Sprinkles
in the previous 7 days, compared with 64.9% in 2008 (P < 0.001). Average intake
was 3.2 sachets week(-1) in 2008, 1.6 sachets week(-1) in 2009 and 1.1 sachets
week(-1) in 2010 (P < 0.001). Factors associated with recent Sprinkles use in
2010 included young age [6-23 months vs. 24-35 months, adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 
= 1.5, P = 0.02], lowest 2 quintiles of socio-economic status (aOR = 1.7, P =
0.004), household attendance at trainings or launches (aOR = 2.8, P < 0.001) and 
ever receiving promotional items including free Sprinkles, calendars, cups and
t-shirts (aOR = 1.7, P = 0.04). In 2010, there was increased prevalence of
anaemia and malaria (P < 0.001), but not iron deficiency (P = 0.44), compared
with that in 2008. Sprinkles use in 2010 was associated with decreased iron
deficiency (P = 0.03). Sprinkles coverage reduced after stopping household
monitoring and reducing marketing activities. Continued promotion and monitoring 
of Sprinkles usage may be important components to sustain the programme.

Do health workers' preferences influence their practices? Assessment of
providers' attitude and personal use of new treatment recommendations for
management of uncomplicated malaria, Tanzania.

BACKGROUND: Due to growing antimalarial drug resistance, Tanzania changed malaria
treatment policies twice within a decade. First in 2001 chloroquine (CQ) was
replaced by sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) for management of uncomplicated
malaria and by late 2006, SP was replaced by artemether-lumefantrine (AL). We
assessed health workers' attitudes and personal practices following the first
treatment policy change, at six months post-change and two years later.
METHODS: Two cross-sectional surveys were conducted in 2002 and 2004 among
healthcare workers in three districts in South-East Tanzania using
semi-structured questionnaires. Attitudes were assessed by enquiring which
antimalarial was considered most suitable for the management of uncomplicated
malaria for the three patient categories: i) children below 5; ii) older children
and adults; and iii) pregnant women. Practice was ascertained by asking which
antimalarial was used in the last malaria episode by the health worker
him/herself and/or dependants. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression
was used to identify factors associated with reported attitudes and practices
towards the new treatment recommendations.
RESULTS: A total of 400 health workers were interviewed; 254 and 146 in the first
and second surveys, respectively. SP was less preferred antimalarial in hospitals
and private health facilities (p<0.01) in the first round, and the preference
worsened in the second round. In the first round, clinicians did not prefer SP
for children below age of 5 and pregnant women (p<0.01), but two years later,
they did not prefer it for all patient scenarios. SP was the most commonly used
antimalarial for management of the last malaria episode for health workers and
their dependants in both rounds, in the public sector (p<0.01). Health workers in
the dispensaries had the highest odds of using SP for their own treatment
[adjusted OR- first round: 6.7 (95%CI: 1.9-23.4); crude OR- second round: 4.5
(1.5-13.3)].
CONCLUSION: Following changes in malaria treatment recommendations, most health
workers did not prefer the new antimalarial drug, and their preferences worsened 
over time. However, many of them still used the newly recommended drug for
management of their own or family members' malaria episode. This indicates that, 
other factors than providers' attitude may have more influence in their personal 
treatment practices.

INTRODUCTION: Insecticide treated net remains a tool of choice for malaria
prevention in Cameroon. However, data suggests that its use by the population,
especially vulnerable groups remains low. Moreover, there is a paucity of
information about factors influencing its use. We sought out to identify factors 
associated with net use in Mfou health district, prior to distribution of long
lasting insecticides treated nets (LLINs) in households.
METHODS: A two-stage cluster random sampling was conducted in 4 health areas with
an average of 13 villages each. A total of 541 households were selected and heads
interviewed using a structured household questionnaire. Data collected were
entered into a database and multivariate logistic regression analyses of the
association between net use and explanatory factors were performed using SPSS.
RESULTS: Net possession and use were respectively, 59.7 and 42.6%; thus, 2 out of
5 people who spent the previous night in households, slept under a net. Factors
associated with net use included: net density≥0.5 (OR=8.88, 95% CI: 6.24-12.64), 
age≥5 years (OR=0.37, 95%CI: 0.28-0.47), secondary education (OR=1.41, 95% CI:
1.11-1.80) compared to primary/no education, parent status (OR=3.32, 95% CI:
2.31-4.76), house construction (OR=1.37, 95% CI: 1.10-1.71) and environment
characteristics (OR=1.46, 95% CI: 1.18-1.80).
CONCLUSION: These data suggest that a universal coverage with one LLIN for two
people should be achieved in households. Then, malaria health education should be
conducted to re-enforce net use among school-aged children and adolescents, as
well as older household members. Moreover, management of environment and
improvement in houses construction are necessary.

Brucellosis, leptospirosis and Q fever are important livestock diseases, commonly
responsible for significant production losses, yet their epidemiology in
sub-Saharan Africa is largely unknown. Animal reservoirs pose the main risk of
transmission to humans, where serious disease can occur. In the developing world 
setting, the flu-like symptoms of the acute stages of these diseases can be
misdiagnosed as malaria, which can result in the administration of the wrong
treatment, prolonged disease and increase in antibiotic resistance. Multivariable
mixed-effects logistic regression models in this study revealed potential risk
factors associated with the aforementioned pathogens in cattle in the Adamawa
Region of Cameroon, with wildlife, namely, buffaloes, playing a major role in
both Brucella and Coxiella burnetii seropositivity. Cattle mixing with other
herds at night and cattle grazing in an area on a route taken by herds on
transhumance appear to be positively associated with Leptospira seropositivity,
while female cows and whether buffaloes are seen during grazing or transhumance
are positively associated with C. burnetii seropositivity. On the other hand,
animals that have been on transhumance in the past year and animals belonging to 
herdsmen of the Fulbe ethnic group appear to be protected against Leptospira and 
C. burnetii, respectively. Cattle of more than 2 years old appear to have
increased odds of being seropositive to either pathogen. Further research is
needed to confirm these findings and improve the knowledge of the epidemiology of
these three pathogens in Africa, taking particular consideration of the wildlife 
involvement in the disease transmission.

Laboratory markers of disease severity in Plasmodium knowlesi infection: a case
control study.

J.

Tübingen, Germany.

BACKGROUND: Plasmodium knowlesi malaria causes severe disease in up to 10% of
cases in Malaysian Borneo and has a mortality rate of 1 - 2%. However, laboratory
markers with the ability to identify patients at risk of developing complications
have not yet been assessed as they have for other species of Plasmodium.
METHODS: A case control study was undertaken in two hospitals in Sarikei and
Sibu, Malaysian Borneo. One hundred and ten patients with uncomplicated (n = 93) 
and severe (n = 17) P. knowlesi malaria were studied. Standardized
pigment-containing neutrophil (PCN) count, parasite density and platelet counts
were determined and analysed by logistic regression and receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) analysis.
RESULTS: The PCN count was strongly associated with risk of disease severity.
Patients with high parasite density (≥ 35,000/μl) or with thrombocytopaenia (≤
45,000/μl) were also more likely to develop complications (odds ratio (OR) = 9.93
and OR = 5.27, respectively). The PCN count yielded the highest area under the
ROC curve (AUC) estimate among all markers of severity (AUC = 0.8561, 95%
confidence interval: 0.7328, 0.9794). However, the difference between all
parameter AUC estimates was not statistically significant (Wald test, p = 0.73).
CONCLUSION: Counting PCN is labour-intensive and not superior in predicting
severity over parasitaemia and platelet counts. Parasite and platelet counts are 
simpler tests with an acceptable degree of precision. Any adult patient diagnosed
with P. knowlesi malaria and having a parasite count ≥ 35,000/μl or ≥ 1% or a
platelet count ≤ 45,000/μl can be regarded at risk of developing complications
and should be managed according to current WHO guidelines for the treatment of
severe malaria.

BACKGROUND: Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT), the treatment of choice 
for uncomplicated falciparum malaria, is unaffordable and generally inaccessible 
in the private sector, the first port of call for most malaria treatment across
rural Africa. Between August 2007 and May 2010, the Uganda Ministry of Health and
the Medicines for Malaria Venture conducted the Consortium for ACT Private Sector
Subsidy (CAPSS) pilot study to test whether access to ACT in the private sector
could be improved through the provision of a high level supply chain subsidy.
METHODS: Four intervention districts were purposefully selected to receive
branded subsidized medicines - "ACT with a leaf", while the fifth district acted 
as the control. Baseline and evaluation outlet exit surveys and retail audits
were conducted at licensed and unlicensed drug outlets in the intervention and
control districts. A survey-adjusted, multivariate logistic regression model was 
used to analyse the intervention's impact on: ACT uptake and price; purchase of
ACT within 24 hours of symptom onset; ACT availability and displacement of
sub-optimal anti-malarial.
RESULTS: At baseline, ACT accounted for less than 1% of anti-malarials purchased 
from licensed drug shops for children less than five years old. However, at
evaluation, "ACT with a leaf" accounted for 69% of anti-malarial purchased in the
interventions districts. Purchase of ACT within 24 hours of symptom onset for
children under five years rose from 0.8% at baseline to 26.2% (95% CI:
23.2-29.2%) at evaluation in the intervention districts. In the control district,
it rose modestly from 1.8% to 5.6% (95% CI: 4.0-7.3%). The odds of purchasing ACT
within 24 hours in the intervention districts compared to the control was 0.46
(95% CI: 0.08-2.68, p=0.4) at baseline and significant increased to 6.11 (95% CI:
4.32-8.62, p<0.0001) at evaluation. Children less than five years of age had "ACT
with a leaf" purchased for them more often than those aged above five years.
There was no evidence of price gouging.
CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that a supply-side subsidy and an intensive
communications campaign significantly increased the uptake and use of ACT in the 
private sector in Uganda.

Quebec, Canada.

To improve access to health care services, an intervention was implemented in
Burkina Faso granting full exemption from user fees. Two further components,
staff training and supervision, were added to support the intervention. Our aim
in this study was to examine how this tripartite intervention affected the
quality of drug prescriptions. Using a mixed methodology, we first conducted an
interrupted time series over 24 months. Nine health centres were studied that had
previously undergone a process analysis. A total of 14 956 prescriptions for
children 0-4 years old were selected by interval sampling from the visit
registries from 1 year before to 1 year after the intervention's launch. We then 
interviewed 14 prescribers. We used three World Health Organization (WHO)
indicators to assess drug prescription quality. Analysis was carried out using
linear regression and logistic regression. The prescribers' statements underwent 
content analysis, to understand their perceptions and changes in their practice
since the subsidy's introduction. One effect of the intervention was a reduced
use of injections (odd ratio (OR) = 0.28 [0.17; 0.46]) in cases of acute lower
respiratory tract infections (ALRTI) without comorbidity. Another was a reduction
in the inappropriate use of antibiotics in malaria without comorbidity (OR = 0.48
[0.33; 0.70]). The average number of drugs prescribed also decreased (coefficient
= -0.14 [-0.20; -0.08]) in cases of ALRTI without comorbidity. The prescribers
reported that their practices were either maintained or improved. The user fees
exemption programme, combined with health staff training and supervision, did not
lead to any deterioration in the quality of drug prescriptions.

BACKGROUND: Malaria and anaemia (Haemoglobin <11 g/dl) remain frequent in
tropical regions and are closely associated. Although anaemia aetiologies are
known to be multi-factorial, most studies in malaria endemic areas have been
confined to analysis of possible associations between anaemia and individual
factors such as malaria. A case control study involving children aged from 1 to
10 years was conducted to assess some assumed contributors to anaemia in the area
of Bonconto Health post in Senegal.
METHODS: Study participants were randomly selected from a list of children who
participated in a survey in December 2010. Children aged from 1 to 10 years with 
haemoglobin level below 11 g/dl represented cases (anaemic children). Control
participants were eligible if of same age group and their haemoglobin level was
>= 11 g/dl. For each participant, a physical examination was done and
anthropometric data collected prior to a biological assessment which included:
malaria parasitaemia infection, intestinal worm carriage, G6PD deficiency, sickle
cell disorders, and alpha-talassaemia.
RESULTS: Three hundred and fifty two children < 10 years of age were enrolled
(176 case and 176 controls). In a logistic regression analysis, anaemia was
significantly associated with malaria parasitaemia (aOR=5.23, 95%CI[1.1-28.48]), 
sickle cell disorders (aOR=2.89, 95%CI[1,32-6.34]), alpha-thalassemia (aOR=1.82, 
95%CI[1.2-3.35]), stunting (aOR=3.37, 95%CI[1.93-5.88], age ranged from 2 to 4
years (aOR=0.13, 95%CI[0.05-0.31]) and age > 5 years (aOR=0.03,
95%CI[0.01-0.08]). Stratified by age group, anaemia was significantly associated 
with stunting in children less than 5 years (aOR=3.1 95%CI[1.4 - 6.8]), with,
sickle cell disorders (aOR=3.5 95%CI [1.4 - 9.0]), alpha-thalassemia (or=2.4
95%CI[1.1-5.3]) and stunting (aOR=3.6 95%CI [1.6-8.2]) for children above 5
years. No association was found between G6PD deficiency, intestinal worm carriage
and children's gender.
CONCLUSION: Malaria parasitaemia, stunting and haemoglobin genetic disorders
represented the major causes of anaemia among study participants. Anaemia control
in this area could be achieved by developing integrated interventions targeting
both malaria and malnutrition.

Fc γ receptor IIIB (FcγRIIIB) polymorphisms are associated with clinical malaria 
in Ghanaian children.

Plasmodium falciparum malaria kills nearly a million people annually. Over 90% of
these deaths occur in children under five years of age in sub-Saharan Africa. A
neutrophil mediated mechanism, the antibody dependent respiratory burst (ADRB),
was recently shown to correlate with protection from clinical malaria. Human
neutrophils constitutively express Fc gamma receptor-FcγRIIA and FcγRIIIB by
which they interact with immunoglobulin (Ig) G (IgG)-subclass antibodies.
Polymorphisms in exon 4 of FCGR2A and exon 3 of FCGR3B genes encoding FcγRIIA and
FcγRIIIB respectively have been described to alter the affinities of both
receptors for IgG. Here, associations between specific polymorphisms, encoding
FcγRIIA p.H166R and FcγRIIIB-NA1/NA2/SH variants with clinical malaria were
investigated in a longitudinal malaria cohort study. FcγRIIA-p.166H/R was
genotyped by gene specific polymerase chain reaction followed by allele specific 
restriction enzyme digestion. FCGR3B-exon 3 was sequenced in 585 children, aged 1
to 12 years living in a malaria endemic region of Ghana. Multivariate logistic
regression analysis found no association between FcγRIIA-166H/R polymorphism and 
clinical malaria. The A-allele of FCGR3B-c.233C>A (rs5030738) was significantly
associated with protection from clinical malaria under two out of three genetic
models (additive: p=0.0061; recessive: p=0.097; dominant: p=0.0076) of
inheritance. The FcγRIIIB-SH allotype (CTGAAA) containing the 233A-allele (in
bold) was associated with protection from malaria (p=0.049). The FcγRIIIB-NA2*03 
allotype (CTGCGA), a variant of the classical FcγRIIIB-NA2 (CTGCAA) was
associated with susceptibility to clinical malaria (p=0.0092). The present study 
is the first to report an association between a variant of FcγRIIIB-NA2 and
susceptibility to clinical malaria and provides justification for further
functional characterization of variants of the classical FcγRIIIB allotypes. This
would be crucial to the improvement of neutrophil mediated functional assays such
as the ADRB assay aimed at assessing the functionality of antibodies induced by
candidate malaria vaccines.

Polymorphisms in the Fc gamma receptor IIIA and Toll-like receptor 9 are
associated with protection against severe malarial anemia and changes in
circulating gamma interferon levels.

An understanding of the immunogenetic basis of naturally acquired immunity to
Plasmodium falciparum infection would aid in the designing of a rationally based 
malaria vaccine. Variants within the Fc gamma receptors (FcγRs) mediate immunity 
through engagement of immunoglobulin G and other immune mediators, such as gamma 
interferon (IFN-γ), resulting in erythrophagocytosis and production of
inflammatory cytokines in severe malarial anemia (SMA). The Toll-like receptors
(TLRs) trigger transcription of proinflammatory cytokines and induce adaptive
immune responses. Therefore, these receptors may condition malaria disease
pathogenesis through alteration in adaptive and innate immune responses. To
further delineate the impacts of FcγRIIIA and TLR9 in SMA pathogenesis, the
associations between FcγRIIIA -176F/V and TLR9 -1237T/C variants, SMA (hemoglobin
[Hb] < 6.0 g/dl), and circulating IFN-γ levels were investigated in children (n =
301) from western Kenya with acute malaria. Multivariate logistic regression
analysis (controlling for potential confounders) revealed that children with the 
FcγRIIIA -176V/TLR9 -1237C (VC) variant combination had 64% reduced odds of
developing SMA (odds ratio [OR], 0.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.20 to
0.64; P = 0.001), while carriers of the FcγRIIIA -176V/TLR9 -1237T (VT) variant
combination were twice as susceptible to SMA (OR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.19 to 3.50; P =
0.009). Children with SMA had higher circulating IFN-γ levels than non-SMA
children (P = 0.008). Hemoglobin levels were negatively correlated with IFN-γ
levels (r = -0.207, P = 0.022). Consistently, the FcγRIIIA -176V/TLR9 -1237T (VT)
carriers had higher levels of circulating IFN-γ (P = 0.011) relative to
noncarriers, supporting the observation that higher IFN-γ levels are associated
with SMA. These results demonstrate that FcγRIIIA-176F/V and TLR9 -1237T/C
variants condition susceptibility to SMA and functional changes in circulating

BACKGROUND: The simulated client (SC) method for evaluating health worker
performance utilizes surveyors who pose as patients to make surreptitious
observations during consultations. Compared to conspicuous observation (CO) by
surveyors, which is commonly done in developing countries, SC data better reflect
usual health worker practices. This information is important because CO can cause
performance to be better than usual. Despite this advantage of SCs, the method's 
full potential has not been realized for evaluating performance for pediatric
illnesses because real children have not been utilized as SCs. Previous SC
studies used scenarios of ill children that were not actually brought to health
workers. During a trial that evaluated a quality improvement intervention in
Benin (the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness [IMCI] strategy), we
conducted an SC survey with adult caretakers as surveyors and real children to
evaluate the feasibility of this approach and used the results to assess the
validity of CO.
METHODS: We conducted an SC survey and a CO survey (one right after the other) of
health workers in the same 55 health facilities. A detailed description of the SC
survey process was produced. Results of the two surveys were compared for 27
performance indicators using logistic regression modeling.
RESULTS: SC and CO surveyors observed 54 and 185 consultations, respectively. No 
serious problems occurred during the SC survey. Performance levels measured by CO
were moderately higher than those measured by SCs (median CO - SC difference =
16.4 percentage-points). Survey differences were sometimes much greater for
IMCI-trained health workers (median difference = 29.7 percentage-points) than for
workers without IMCI training (median difference = 3.1 percentage-points).
CONCLUSION: SC surveys can be done safely with real children if appropriate
precautions are taken. CO can introduce moderately large positive biases, and
these biases might be greater for health workers exposed to quality improvement
interventions.

BACKGROUND: Urban malaria remains a public health problem. Dakar is located in a 
low endemic area. However, anti-malarial drugs consumption is reported to be high
despite the decline of malaria announced by health authorities. The objective of 
the present study was to assess the burden of reported malaria attacks (RMAs) in 
2008 and to describe care-seeking behaviours in the population of Dakar, Senegal.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 2,952 households selected from 50 sites
were visited. In each household, a women and a child between two and 10 years old
were interviewed about a malaria episode that occurred in 2008. The following
information was recorded: age, education level, sex (for children), type of care 
seeking, method of diagnosis, use of anti-malarial treatment, place of medication
purchase, bed net use, malaria-related deaths in the family, and perceptions of
the frequency of mosquito bites. After a description of the variables in each
subsample, a Pearson's chi-square test was used to compare proportions, and
logistic regression was performed to identify the association between RMAs and
other covariates.
RESULTS: Among women, 31.8% reported a malaria attack in 2008; among children,
the rate of malaria attacks reported by mothers or caretakers was 39.0%. With
regard to care-seeking, 79.5% of women and 81.5% of children with a RMA had
visited health facilities (HFs). Younger women and children under five years old 
were more likely to visit a HF (P<0.001). Presumptive diagnosis was the primary
method that was used to identify malaria in HFs. For those who had visited a HF, 
the rate of anti-malarial treatment was 77% in women and 60% in children.
Finally, 43.6% of women and 42.0% of children declared the use of bed nets. In a 
multivariate analysis, the malaria-related death of a relative and perceptions of
mosquito bites were significantly associated with RMAs in women. In children, age
was associated with RMAs.
CONCLUSION: The frequent perceptions of the occurrence of malaria in the
population were confirmed at the HF by the high presumptive diagnosis of health
professionals. Despite the decline of malaria that has been announced by health
authorities, the population will continue to complain of malaria and seek care
directly at private pharmacies. This situation may sustain the circulation of
anti-malarial drugs and increase the risk of an emergence of anti-malarial
resistance.

198, BP 1386, Dakar, Senegal.

BACKGROUND: In tropical Africa, where malaria is highly endemic, low grade
infections are asymptomatic and the diagnosis of clinical malaria is usually
based on parasite density. Here we investigate how changes in malaria control and
endemicity modify diagnostic criteria of Plasmodium falciparum attacks.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Parasitological and clinical data from the population of
Dielmo, Senegal, monitored during 20 years, are analyzed in a random-effect
logistic regression model to investigate the relationship between the level of
parasitemia and risk of fever. Between 1990 and 2010, P. falciparum prevalence in
asymptomatic persons declined from 85% to 1% in children 0-3 years and from 34%
to 2% in adults ≥50 years. Thresholds levels of parasitemia for attributing fever
episodes to malaria decreased by steps in relation to control policies. Using
baseline threshold during following periods underestimated P. falciparum attacks 
by 9.8-20.2% in children and 18.9-40.2% in adults. Considering all fever episodes
associated with malaria parasites as clinical attacks overestimated P. falciparum
attacks by 42.2-68.5% in children and 45.9-211.7% in adults.
CONCLUSIONS: Malaria control modifies in all age-groups the threshold levels of
parasitemia to be used for the assessment of malaria morbidity and to guide
therapeutic decisions. Even under declining levels of malaria endemicity, the
parasite density method must remain the reference method for distinguishing
malaria from other causes of fever and assessing trends in the burden of malaria.

INTRODUCTION: WHO now recommends test-based management of malaria (TBMM) across
all age-groups. This implies artemisinin-based combination treatment (ACT) should
be restricted to rapid diagnostic test (RDT)-positive cases. This is a departure 
from what caregivers in rural communities have been used to for many years.
METHODS: We conducted a survey among caregivers living close to 32 health centres
in six districts in rural Ghana and used logistic regression to explore factors
likely to influence caregiver acceptability of RDT based case management and
concern about the denial of ACT on account of negative RDT results. Focus group
discussions were conducted to explain the quantitative findings and to elicit
further factors.
RESULTS: A total of 3047 caregivers were interviewed. Nearly all (98%) reported a
preference for TBMM over presumptive treatment. Caregivers who preferred TBMM
were less likely to be concerned about the denial of ACT to their test-negative
children (O.R. 0.57, 95%C.I. 0.33-0.98). Compared with caregivers who had never
secured national health insurance cover, caregivers who had valid (adjusted O.R. 
1.30, 95% CI 1.07-1.61) or expired (adjusted O.R. 1.38, 95% CI 1.12-1.73)
insurance cover were more likely to be concerned about the denial of ACT to their
RDT-negative children. Major factors that promote TBMM acceptability include the 
perception that a blood test at health centre level represents improvement in the
quality of care, leads to improvement in treatment outcomes, and offers
opportunity for better communication between health workers and caregivers.
Acceptability is also enhanced by engaging caregivers in the procedures of the
test. Apprehensions about negative health worker attitude could however undermine
acceptance.
CONCLUSION: Test (RDT)-based management of malaria in under-five children is
likely to be acceptable to caregivers in rural Ghana. The quality of
caregiver-health worker interaction needs to be improved if acceptability is to
be sustained.

OBJECTIVE: To understand the epidemiological characteristics of co-infection of
HIV and Blastocystis hominis and its risk factors.
METHODS: A total of 309 people with HIV positive in the development zone of
Fuyang City were recruited, and the face to face questionnaires were conducted to
collect the information of behavioral characteristics and sociodemographic data
of the participants. Meanwhile, the samples of stool and blood were collected to 
test B. hominis, cytokines and CD4+/CD8+ T-lymphocyte. The influencing factors of
co-infection of HIV and Blastocystis hominis were analyzed by the single factor
analysis and Logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: Among the 309 people involved, 302 accepted feces examinations, 286
accepted the questionnaire investigation, and 263 accepted both of them. The
infection rate of B. hominis was 17.11%, that of the female was 21.90%, which was
significantly higher than that of the male (11.90%) (P < 0.05). The results from 
the multivariate Logistic regression model showed that good nutrition was
significantly associated with the co-infection of HIV and B. hominis (OR = 0.263,
95% CI: 0.073, 0.945).
CONCLUSIONS: The infection rate of B. hominis is high in people with HIV
positive, and the nutrition situation of individuals may be one of the important 
risk factors associated with co-infection.

BACKGROUND: Low birthweight is a significant risk factor for neonatal and infant 
death. A prominent cause of low birthweight is infection with Plasmodium
falciparum during pregnancy. Antimalarial intermittent preventive therapy in
pregnancy (IPTp) and insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITNs) significantly
reduce the risk of low birthweight in regions of stable malaria transmission. We 
aimed to assess the effectiveness of malaria prevention in pregnancy (IPTp or
ITNs) at preventing low birthweight and neonatal mortality under routine
programme conditions in malaria endemic countries of Africa.
METHODS: We used a retrospective birth cohort from national cross-sectional
datasets in 25 African countries from 2000-10. We used all available datasets
from multiple indicator cluster surveys, demographic and health surveys, malaria 
indicator surveys, and AIDS indicator surveys that were publically available as
of 2011. We tried to limit confounding bias through exact matching on potential
confounding factors associated with both exposure to malaria prevention (ITNs or 
IPTp with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine) in pregnancy and birth outcomes, including
local malaria transmission, neonatal tetanus vaccination, maternal age and
education, and household wealth. We used a logistic regression model to test for 
associations between malaria prevention in pregnancy and low birthweight, and a
Poisson model for the outcome of neonatal mortality. Both models incorporated the
matched strata as a random effect, while accounting for additional potential
confounding factors with fixed effect covariates.
FINDINGS: We analysed 32 national cross-sectional datasets. Exposure of women in 
their first or second pregnancy to full malaria prevention with IPTp or ITNs was 
significantly associated with decreased risk of neonatal mortality (protective
efficacy [PE] 18%, 95% CI 4-30; incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0·820, 95% CI
0·698-0·962), compared with newborn babies of mothers with no protection, after
exact matching and controlling for potential confounding factors. Compared with
women with no protection, exposure of pregnant women during their first two
pregnancies to full malaria prevention in pregnancy through IPTp or ITNs was
significantly associated with reduced odds of low birthweight (PE 21%, 14-27; IRR
0·792, 0·732-0·857), as measured by a combination of weight and birth size
perceived by the mother, after exact matching and controlling for potential
confounding factors.
INTERPRETATION: Malaria prevention in pregnancy is associated with substantial
reductions in neonatal mortality and low birthweight under routine malaria
control programme conditions. Malaria control programmes should strive to achieve
full protection in pregnant women by both IPTp and ITNs to maximise their
benefits. Despite an attempt to mitigate bias and potential confounding by
matching women on factors thought to be associated with access to malaria
prevention in pregnancy and birth outcomes, some level of confounding bias
possibly remains.

Analysis of the trap gene provides evidence for the role of elevation and vector 
abundance in the genetic diversity of Plasmodium relictum in Hawaii.

Hawaii at Hilo, Hilo, HI 96720, USA.

BACKGROUND: The avian disease system in Hawaii offers an ideal opportunity to
investigate host-pathogen interactions in a natural setting. Previous studies
have recognized only a single mitochondrial lineage of avian malaria (Plasmodium 
relictum) in the Hawaiian Islands, but cloning and sequencing of nuclear genes
suggest a higher degree of genetic diversity.
METHODS: In order to evaluate genetic diversity of P. relictum at the population 
level and further understand host-parasite interactions, a modified single-base
extension (SBE) method was used to explore spatial and temporal distribution
patterns of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the thrombospondin-related 
anonymous protein (trap) gene of P. relictum infections from 121 hatch-year
amakihi (Hemignathus virens) on the east side of Hawaii Island.
RESULTS: Rare alleles and mixed infections were documented at three of eight SNP 
loci; this is the first documentation of genetically diverse infections of P.
relictum at the population level in Hawaii. Logistic regression revealed that the
likelihood of infection with a rare allele increased at low-elevation, but
decreased as mosquito capture rates increased. The inverse relationship between
vector capture rates and probability of infection with a rare allele is
unexpected given current theories of epidemiology developed in human malarias.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that pathogen diversity in Hawaii 
may be driven by a complex interaction of factors including transmission rates,
host immune pressures, and parasite-parasite competition.

BACKGROUND: Few comprehensive data exist on disease incidence for specific
etiologies of acute respiratory illness (ARI) in older children and adults in
Africa.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: From March 1, 2007, to February 28, 2010, among a
surveillance population of 21,420 persons >5 years old in rural western Kenya, we
collected blood for culture and malaria smears, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal 
swabs for quantitative real-time PCR for ten viruses and three atypical bacteria,
and urine for pneumococcal antigen testing on outpatients and inpatients meeting 
a ARI case definition (cough or difficulty breathing or chest pain and
temperature >38.0 °C or oxygen saturation <90% or hospitalization). We also
collected swabs from asymptomatic controls, from which we calculated
pathogen-attributable fractions, adjusting for age, season, and HIV-status, in
logistic regression. We calculated incidence by pathogen, adjusting for
health-seeking for ARI and pathogen-attributable fractions. Among 3,406 ARI
patients >5 years old (adjusted annual incidence 12.0 per 100 person-years),
influenza A virus was the most common virus (22% overall; 11% inpatients, 27%
outpatients) and Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common bacteria (16%
overall; 23% inpatients, 14% outpatients), yielding annual incidences of 2.6 and 
1.7 episodes per 100 person-years, respectively. Influenza A virus, influenza B
virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus were more
prevalent in swabs among cases (22%, 6%, 8% and 5%, respectively) than controls. 
Adenovirus, parainfluenza viruses, rhinovirus/enterovirus, parechovirus, and
Mycoplasma pneumoniae were not more prevalent among cases than controls.
Pneumococcus and non-typhi Salmonella were more prevalent among HIV-infected
adults, but prevalence of viruses was similar among HIV-infected and HIV-negative
individuals. ARI incidence was highest during peak malaria season.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Vaccination against influenza and pneumococcus (by
potential herd immunity from childhood vaccination or of HIV-infected adults)
might prevent much of the substantial ARI incidence among persons >5 years old in
similar rural African settings.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of participatory healthcare-provider orientation
in enhancing patient knowledge, appropriate prescribing and dispensing of
artemether-lumefantrine, during drug treatment of uncomplicated malaria.
METHODS: A cluster quasi-experimental study. The authors developed strategies to 
address challenges encountered by healthcare providers during clinical management
of malaria. The primary outcome was patient knowledge on prescribed malaria drug 
treatment. Secondary outcomes were appropriate prescribing and provision of
adequate drug dispensing information. The authors used generalised estimating
equation logistic regression to investigate correlates of appropriate use of
artemether-lumefantrine.
RESULTS: The proportion of patients or caretakers of paediatric patients
sufficiently knowledgeable about malaria treatment increased from 16/85 (18.8%)
at baseline to 33/96 (34.4%) at evaluation, OR 2.26 (95% CI 1.13 to 4.49),
p=0.020, in the intervention, and fell slightly from 49/134 (36.6%) to 35/114
(30.7%), OR 0.77, (95% CI 0.45 to 1.31), p=0.331 in the control district. This
was enhanced by the existence of drug-dispensing standard operating procedures
(adjusted OR 1.85, 95% CI 0.98 to 3.50; p=0.057). The proportion of appropriate
prescriptions increased from 61/87 (70.1%) to 94/112 (83.9%) in the intervention 
district, OR 2.23 (95% CI 1.13 to 4.40), p=0.020 and reduced from 91/115 (79.1%) 
to 75/112 (67.0%) in the control district, OR 0.53, (95% CI 0.29 to 0.97),
p=0.040. The frequency of adequately dispensed prescriptions increased in the
intervention district (34(32.4%) to 53(45.3%), OR 1.73 (95% CI 1.00 to 2.99),
p=0.050) but decreased in the control location (94 (69.6%) to 71 (52.6%), OR 0.48
(95% CI 0.29 to 0.80), p=0.004).
CONCLUSIONS: Participatory healthcare-provider orientation enhanced patient
knowledge, healthcare provider prescribing and dispensing of
artemether-lumefantrine, bolstered by adequate medication counselling and use of 
drug-dispensing standard operating procedures.

BACKGROUND: Few comprehensive data exist on the etiology of severe acute
respiratory illness (SARI) among African children.
METHODS: From March 1, 2007 to February 28, 2010, we collected blood for culture 
and nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs for real-time quantitative polymerase 
chain reaction for 10 viruses and 3 atypical bacteria among children aged <5
years with SARI, defined as World Health Organization-classified severe or very
severe pneumonia or oxygen saturation <90%, who visited a clinic in rural western
Kenya. We collected swabs from controls without febrile or respiratory symptoms. 
We calculated odds ratios for infection among cases, adjusting for age and season
in logistic regression. We calculated SARI incidence, adjusting for healthcare
seeking for SARI in the community.
RESULTS: Two thousand nine hundred seventy-three SARI cases were identified (54% 
inpatient, 46% outpatient), yielding an adjusted incidence of 56 cases per 100
person-years. A pathogen was detected in 3.3% of noncontaminated blood cultures; 
non-typhi Salmonella (1.9%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (0.7%) predominated. A
pathogen was detected in 84% of nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal specimens, the most 
common being rhino/enterovirus (50%), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, 22%),
adenovirus (16%) and influenza viruses (8%). Only RSV and influenza viruses were 
found more commonly among cases than controls (odds ratio 2.9, 95% confidence
interval: 1.3-6.7 and odds ratio 4.8, 95% confidence interval: 1.1-21,
respectively). Incidence of RSV, influenza viruses and S. pneumoniae were 7.1,
5.8 and 0.04 cases per 100 person-years, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Among Kenyan children with SARI, RSV and influenza virus are the
most likely viral causes and pneumococcus the most likely bacterial cause.
Contemporaneous controls are important for interpreting upper respiratory tract
specimens.

As a leading cause of childhood mortality worldwide, selection pressure by
Plasmodium falciparum continues to shape the human genome. Severe disturbances
within the microcirculation result from the adhesion of infected erythrocytes to 
host receptors on monocytes, platelets, and endothelium. In this prospective
study, we compared expression of all major host cytoadhesion receptors among
Ugandan children presenting with uncomplicated malaria (n = 1078) versus children
with severe malaria (n = 855), including cerebral malaria (n = 174), severe
anaemia (n = 522), and lactic acidosis (n = 154). We report a significant
survival advantage attributed to blood group O and increased monocyte expression 
of CD36 and ICAM1 (CD54). The high case fatality rate syndromes of cerebral
malaria and lactic acidosis were associated with high platelet CD36 expression
and thrombocytopenia, and severe malaria anaemia was characterized by low ICAM1
expression. In a logistic regression model of disease severity, odds ratios for
the mitigating effects of blood group O, CD36, and ICAM1 phenotypes were greater 
than that of sickle haemoglobin. Host genetic adaptations to Plasmodium
falciparum suggest new potential malaria treatment strategies.

BACKGROUND: It is unclear how long it takes for health interventions to
transition from research and development (R&D) to being used against diseases
prevalent in resource-poor countries. We undertook an analysis of the time
required to begin implementation of four vaccines and three malaria
interventions. We evaluated five milestones for each intervention, and assessed
if the milestones were associated with beginning implementation.
METHODS: The authors screened World Health Organization (WHO) databases to
determine the number of years between first regulatory approval of interventions,
and countries beginning implementation. Descriptive analyses of temporal patterns
and statistical analyses using logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard
models were used to evaluate associations between five milestones and the
beginning of implementation for each intervention. The milestones were: (A)
presence of a coordinating group focused on the intervention; (B) availability of
an intervention tailored to developing country health systems; (C) international 
financing commitment, and; (D) initial and (E) comprehensive WHO recommendations.
Countries were categorized by World Bank income criteria.
RESULTS: Five years after regulatory approval, no low-income countries (LICs) had
begun implementing any of the vaccines, increasing to an average of only 4% of
LICs after 10 years. Each malaria intervention was used by an average of 7% of
LICs after five years and 37% after 10 years. Four of the interventions had
similar implementation rates to hepatitis B vaccine (HepB), while one was slower 
and one was faster than HepB. A financing commitment and initial WHO
recommendation appeared to be temporally associated with the beginning of
implementation. The initial recommendation from WHO was the only milestone
associated in all statistical analyses with countries beginning implementation
(relative rate = 1.97, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Although possible that four milestones were not associated with
countries beginning implementation, we propose an alternative interpretation;
that the milestones were not realized early enough in each intervention's
development to shorten the time to beginning implementation. We discuss a
framework built upon existing literature for consideration during the development
of future interventions. Identifying critical milestones and their timing
relative to R&D, promises to help new interventions realize their intended public
health impact more rapidly.

BACKGROUND: Diarrhea is a leading cause of childhood morbidity and mortality in
sub-Saharan Africa. Data on risk factors for mortality are limited. We conducted 
hospital-based surveillance to characterize the etiology of diarrhea and identify
risk factors for death among children hospitalized with diarrhea in rural western
Kenya.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We enrolled all children <5 years old, hospitalized with
diarrhea (≥3 loose stools in 24 hours) at two district hospitals in Nyanza
Province, western Kenya. Clinical and demographic information was collected.
Stool specimens were tested for bacterial and viral pathogens. Bivariate and
multivariable logistic regression analyses were carried out to identify risk
factors for death. From May 23, 2005 to May 22, 2007, 1,146 children <5 years old
were enrolled; 107 (9%) children died during hospitalization. Nontyphoidal
Salmonella were identified in 10% (118), Campylobacter in 5% (57), and Shigella
in 4% (42) of 1,137 stool samples; rotavirus was detected in 19% (196) of 1,021
stool samples. Among stools from children who died, nontyphoidal Salmonella were 
detected in 22%, Shigella in 11%, rotavirus in 9%, Campylobacter in 5%, and S.
Typhi in <1%. In multivariable analysis, infants who died were more likely to
have nontyphoidal Salmonella (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 6·8; 95% CI 3·1-14·9), 
and children <5 years to have Shigella (aOR = 5·5; 95% CI 2·2-14·0) identified
than children who survived. Children who died were less likely to be infected
with rotavirus (OR = 0·4; 95% CI 0·2-0·8). Further risk factors for death
included being malnourished (aOR = 4·2; 95% CI 2·1-8·7); having oral thrush on
physical exam (aOR = 2·3; 95% CI 1·4-3·8); having previously sought care at a
hospital for the illness (aOR = 2·2; 95% CI 1·2-3·8); and being dehydrated as
diagnosed at discharge/death (aOR = 2·5; 95% CI 1·5-4·1). A clinical diagnosis of
malaria, and malaria parasites seen on blood smear, were not associated with
increased risk of death. This study only captured in-hospital childhood deaths,
and likely missed a substantial number of additional deaths that occurred at
home.
CONCLUSION: Nontyphoidal Salmonella and Shigella are associated with mortality
among rural Kenyan children with diarrhea who access a hospital. Improved
prevention and treatment of diarrheal disease is necessary. Enhanced surveillance
and simplified laboratory diagnostics in Africa may assist clinicians in
appropriately treating potentially fatal diarrheal illness.

INTRODUCTION: Malaria during pregnancy remains a serious public health problem.
The aim of this study was to establish the prevalence and possible risk factors
for malaria in pregnant women attending antenatal care at Augusto Ngangula
Specialized General Hospital in Luanda, Angola.
METHODS: Pregnant women (679 total) who attended antenatal care from April to
September 2008 were included in the study after signing informed consent. For
each participant, the social-demographic profile and malaria and obstetric
histories were investigated via a questionnaire. Diagnosis was made by optic
microscopy, and hemoglobin concentration measured. The associations between age, 
parity, gestational age, residence, schooling, malaria during gravity, anemia and
treatment with incidence of Plasmodium falciparum infection were analyzed through
logistic regression.
RESULTS: During the period of study, 74 (10.9%) out of 679 women were infected by
P. falciparum. The average concentration of hemoglobin was 11.1 ± 0.07 g/dL, and 
there were significant associations between the history of malaria during
pregnancy, P. falciparum infection (p<0.01) and anemia at the time of observation
(p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Previous history of malaria during pregnancy represents a risk
factor for current infection and anemia was an important complication associated 
with malaria, even in women who were treated with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine
during pregnancy.

BACKGROUND: Severe falciparum malaria with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
coinfection is common in settings with a high prevalence of both diseases, but
there is little information on whether HIV affects the clinical presentation and 
outcome of severe malaria.
METHODS: HIV status was assessed prospectively in hospitalized parasitemic adults
and children with severe malaria in Beira, Mozambique, as part of a clinical
trial comparing parenteral artesunate versus quinine (ISRCTN50258054). Clinical
signs, comorbidity, complications, and disease outcome were compared according to
HIV status.
RESULTS: HIV-1 seroprevalence was 11% (74/655) in children under 15 years and 72%
(49/68) in adults with severe malaria. Children with HIV coinfection presented
with more severe acidosis, anemia, and respiratory distress, and higher
peripheral blood parasitemia and plasma Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich
protein-2 (PfHRP2). During hospitalization, deterioration in coma score,
convulsions, respiratory distress, and pneumonia were more common in
HIV-coinfected children, and mortality was 26% (19/74) versus 9% (53/581) in
uninfected children (P < .001). In an age- and antimalarial treatment-adjusted
logistic regression model, significant, independent predictors for death were
renal impairment, acidosis, parasitemia, and plasma PfHRP2 concentration.
CONCLUSIONS: Severe malaria in HIV-coinfected patients presents with higher
parasite burden, more complications, and comorbidity, and carries a higher case
fatality rate. Early identification of HIV coinfection is important for the
clinical management of severe malaria.

BACKGROUND: The debate over physicians' geographical distribution has attracted
the attention of the economic and public health literature over the last forty
years. Nonetheless, it is still to date unclear what influences physicians'
location, and whether foreign physicians contribute to fill the geographical gaps
left by national doctors in any given country. The present research sets out to
investigate the current distribution of national and international physicians in 
Portugal, with the objective to understand its determinants and provide an
evidence base for policy-makers to identify policies to influence it.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study of physicians currently registered in Portugal
was conducted to describe the population and explore the association of physician
residence patterns with relevant personal and municipality characteristics. Data 
from the Portuguese Medical Council on physicians' residence and characteristics 
were analysed, as well as data from the National Institute of Statistics on
municipalities' population, living standards and health care network. Descriptive
statistics, chi-square tests, negative binomial and logistic regression modelling
were applied to determine: (a) municipality characteristics predicting Portuguese
and International physicians' geographical distribution, and; (b) doctors'
characteristics that could increase the odds of residing outside the country's
metropolitan areas.
RESULTS: There were 39,473 physicians in Portugal in 2008, 51.1% of whom male,
and 40.2% between 41 and 55 years of age. They were predominantly Portuguese
(90.5%), with Spanish, Brazilian and African nationalities also represented.
Population, Population's Purchasing Power, Nurses per capita and Municipality
Development Index (MDI) were the municipality characteristics displaying the
strongest association with national physicians' location. For foreign physicians,
the MDI was not statistically significant, while municipalities' foreign
population applying for residence appeared to be an additional positive factor in
their location decisions. In general, being foreigner and male resulted to be the
physician characteristics increasing the odds of residing outside the
metropolitan areas. However, among the internationals, older doctors were more
likely to reside outside metropolitan areas. Being Spanish or Brazilian (but not 
of African origin) was found to increase the odds of being based outside the
Lisbon and Oporto metropolitan areas.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed the relevance of studying one country's
physician population to understand the factors driving national and international
doctors' location decisions. A more nuanced understanding of national and foreign
doctors' location appears to be needed to design more effective policies to
reduce the imbalance of medical services across geographical areas.

BACKGROUND: Folate and iron deficiency during pregnancy are risk factors for
anaemia, preterm delivery, and low birth weight, and may contribute to poor
neonatal health and increased maternal mortality. The World Health Organization
recommends supplementation of folic acid (FA) and iron for all pregnant women at 
risk of malnutrition to prevent anaemia. We assessed the use of prenatal folic
acid and iron supplementation among women in a geographical area with a high
prevalence of anaemia, in relation to socio-demographic, morbidity and health
services utilization factors.
METHODS: We analysed a cohort of 21,889 women who delivered at Kilimanjaro
Christian Medical Centre (KCMC), Moshi, Tanzania, between 1999 and 2008. Logistic
regression models were used to describe patterns of reported intake of prenatal
FA and iron supplements.
RESULTS: Prenatal intake of FA and iron supplements was reported by 17.2% and
22.3% of pregnant women, respectively. Sixteen percent of women reported intake
of both FA and iron. Factors positively associated with FA supplementation were
advanced maternal age (OR = 1.17, 1.02-1.34), unknown HIV status (OR = 1.54,
1.42-1.67), a diagnosis of anaemia during pregnancy (OR = 12.03, 9.66-14.98) and 
indicators of lower socioeconomic status. Women were less likely to take these
supplements if they reported having had a malaria episode before (OR = 0.57,
0.53-0.62) or during pregnancy (OR = 0.45, 0.41-0.51), reported having contracted
other infectious diseases (OR = 0.45, 0.42-0.49), were multiparous (OR = 0.73,
0.66-0.80), had preeclampsia/eclampsia (OR = 0.48, 0.38-0.61), or other diseases 
(OR = 0.55, 0.44-0.69) during pregnancy. Similar patterns of association emerged 
when iron supplementation alone and supplementation with both iron and FA were
evaluated.
CONCLUSIONS: FA and iron supplementation are low among pregnant women in Northern
Tanzania, in particular among women with co-morbidities before or during
pregnancy. Attempts should be made to increase supplementation both in general
and among women with pregnancy complications.

BACKGROUND: Over the years, reports implicate improper anti-malarial use as a
major contributor of morbidity and mortality amongst millions of residents in
malaria endemic areas, Kenya included. However, there are limited reports on
improper use of Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy (ACT) which is a first-line
drug in the treatment of malaria in Kenya. Knowing this is important for ensured 
sustainable cure rates and also protection against the emergence of resistant
malarial parasites. We therefore investigated ACT adherence level, factors
associated with non-adherence and accessibility in households (n = 297) in rural 
location of Southeast Alego location in Siaya County in western Kenya.
METHODS: ACT Adherence level was assessed with reference to the duration of
treatment and number of tablets taken. Using systematic random sampling
technique, a questionnaire was administered to a particular household member who 
had the most recent malaria episode (<2 weeks) and used ACT for cure.
Parents/caretakers provided information for children aged <13 years. Key
Informant Interviews (KIIs) were also conducted with healthcare providers and
private dispensing chemist operators.
RESULTS: Adherence to ACT prescription remained low at 42.1% and 57.9% among
individuals above 13 and less than 13 years, respectively. Stratification by
demographic and socio-economic characteristics in relation to ACT adherence
revealed that age (P = 0.011), education level (P < 0.01), ability to read (P <
0.01) and household (HH) monthly income (P = 0.002) significantly affected the
level of ACT adherence. Consistently, logistic regression model demonstrated that
low age (OR, 0.571, 95% CI, 0.360-0.905; P = 0.017), higher education level (OR, 
0.074; 95% CI 0.017-0.322; P < 0.01), ability to read (OR, 0.285, 95% CI,
0.167-0.486; P < 0.01) and higher income (Ksh. > 9000; OR, 0.340; 95% CI,
0.167-0.694; P = 0.003) were associated with ACT adherence. In addition, about
52.9% of the respondents reported that ACT was not always available at the source
and that drug availability (P = 0.020) and distance to drug source (P < 0.01)
significantly affected accessibility.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that more than half of those who get ACT
prescription do not take recommended dose and that accessibility is of concern.
The findings of this study suggest a potential need to improve accessibility and 
also initiate programmatic interventions to encourage patient-centred care.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the tolerability of mefloquine intermittent preventive 
treatment (MQ IPTp) for malaria in HIV-infected pregnant women compared with
HIV-negative women.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort study comparing samples of HIV-negative and
HIV-infected pregnant women from 2 clinical trials conducted in Benin.
METHODS: One hundred and three HIV-infected women from the ongoing PACOME trial
were compared with 421 HIV-negative women from a former trial, both trials aiming
to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of MQ IPTp, administered at the dose of
15 mg/kg. Descriptive analysis compared the proportion of women reporting at
least 1 adverse reaction, according to HIV status. Multilevel logistic regression
identified factors associated with the probability of reporting an adverse
reaction for each MQ intake.
RESULTS: Dizziness and vomiting were the most frequent adverse reactions. Adverse
reactions were less frequent in HIV-infected women (65% versus 78%, P = 0.009).
In multilevel analysis, HIV infection [odds ratio (OR) = 0.23, 95% confidence
interval (CI) = 0.08 to 0.61] decreased the risk for adverse reactions, whereas
detectable viral load (OR = 2.46, 95% CI = 1.07 to 5.66), first intake (versus
further intakes, OR = 5.26, 95% CI = 3.70 to 7.14), older age (OR = 1.62, 95% CI 
= 1.13 to 2.32), and higher education level (OR = 1.71, 95% CI = 1.12 to 2.61)
increased the risk. Moderate and severe adverse reactions were more frequent when
antiretrovirals were started concomitantly with a MQ intake.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides reassuring data on the use of MQ IPTp in
HIV-infected pregnant women. However frequent, adverse reactions remained
moderate and did not impair adherence to MQ IPTp. In this high-risk group, MQ
might be an acceptable alternative in case sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine loses its
efficacy for intermittent preventive treatment.

    Indian J Pediatr. 2013 Sep;80(9):796.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence, etiology, short term outcome and
predictors of mortality in hospitalized children aged 1 mo to 13 y with Acute
Kidney Injury (AKI).
METHODS: This prospective observational study was conducted in the pediatric
wards and the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of a tertiary hospital in
southern India, to study the clinico-etiological profile of AKI (defined
according to the Acute Kidney Injury Network criteria). From June 2010 through
March 2011, 2376 children were included in the study.
RESULTS: The incidence of AKI was 5.2 % in the pediatric wards and 25.1 % in the 
PICU. AKI occurred in association with infections (55.4 %), acute
glomerulonephritis (16.9 %), cardiac disease (4.8 %), envenomations (4.2 %) and
hemolytic uremic syndrome (3.6 %). Pneumonia constituted 26.1 % of the
infections. Tropical febrile illnesses (dengue, scrub typhus, enteric fever,
cholera, tuberculosis, malaria and leptospirosis) constituted 15.6 % of children 
with AKI. Dialysis was required in 14.5 % of patients; mortality was 17.5 %. A
significant proportion of children (17.5 % of survivors) had partial renal
recovery at discharge. On multivariate logistic regression, dysnatremia and
meningoencephalitis were independent predictors of mortality in AKI.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of AKI is high in the patient population, including
the non-critically ill children. AKI continues to be associated with adverse
outcomes. Presence of dysnatremia and meningoencephalitis are poor predictors of 
outcome in AKI.

This paper reports on a study, which assessed coverage with malaria control
interventions in rural Burkina Faso, namely insecticide-treated mosquito nets
(ITN) ownership, intermittent preventive treatment (IPTp) for pregnant women and 
artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) for under-five children. The study
also addressed the distributional impact of such interventions, with specific
reference to equity. The study used data from a representative household survey
conducted on 1106 households in the Nouna Health District in 2010. Findings
indicated that 59% of all households owned at least one ITN, 66% of all pregnant 
women received IPT at least once and 34% of under-five children reporting a
malaria case were treated with ACT. Multivariate logistic regression revealed
that higher socio-economic status, ownership of at least one radio and living in 
a village within a Health and Demographic Surveillance System were significantly 
positively associated with ITN, IPTp and ACT coverage. ITN coverage was higher
among households in villages, which had previously hosted an ITN trial and/or the
most favourable arm of a trial. Comparing current findings with previous
estimates suggests that the country has made substantial progress towards scaling
up malaria control interventions but that current coverage rates are still far
from achieving the universal coverage targets set by the Roll Back Malaria
Partnership. In addition, current coverage patterns reveal the existence of
multiple inequities across groups, suggesting that current policies are
inadequate to achieve equitable scaling up. Future planning of malaria control
interventions ought to take into consideration current inadequacies and lead to
programmes better designed to overcome them.

BACKGROUND: In November 2010, Sierra Leone distributed over three million
long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs) with the objective of providing
protection from malaria to individuals in all households in the country.
METHODS: We conducted a nationally representative survey six months after the
mass distribution campaign to evaluate its impact on household
insecticide-treated net (ITN) ownership and use. We examined factors associated
with household ITN possession and use with logistic regression models.
RESULTS: The survey included 4,620 households with equal representation in each
of the 14 districts. Six months after the campaign, 87.6% of households own at
least one ITN, which represents an increase of 137% over the most recent estimate
of 37% in 2008. Thirty-six percent of households possess at least one ITN per two
household members; rural households were more likely than urban households to
have ≥ 1:2 ITN to household members, but there was no difference by
socio-economic status or household head education. Among individuals in
households possessing ≥ 1 ITN, 76.5% slept under an ITN the night preceding the
survey. Individuals in households where the household head had heard malaria
messaging, had correct knowledge of malaria transmission, and where at least one 
ITN was hanging, were more likely to have slept under an ITN.
CONCLUSIONS: The mass distribution campaign was effective at achieving high
coverage levels across the population, notably so among rural households where
the malaria burden is higher. These important gains in equitable access to
malaria prevention will need to be maintained to produce long-term reductions in 
the malaria burden.

explore the influencing factors associated with the co-infection.
METHODS: A total of 309 people with HIV positive in Fuyang City of Anhui Province
were recruited and their fecal and blood samples were collected for examinations 
of Cryptosporidium spp. infection and the levels of hemoglobin, cytokines and
CD4+/CD8+ T-lymphocytes. Meanwhile, the questionnaire survey was conducted.
RESULTS: Among 302 people involved in fecal examinations, the infection rate of
Cryptosporidium spp. was 8.28%, and the difference between infection rates of the
male (13.49%) and the female (2.92%) was statistically significant (P < 0.05).
The multivariate logistic regression model showed that 4 factors were
significantly associated with the coinfection of HIV and Cryptosporidium spp,
including male (OR = 6.700, 95% CI: 2.030, 22.114), younger than 42 years old (OR
= 4.148, 95% CI: 1.348, 12.761), level of IL-2 below 77 pg/ml (OR = 0.226, 95%CI:
0.076, 0.674) and personal hygiene habits (OR = 0.324, 95% CI: 0.105, 0.994).
CONCLUSION: The co-infection rate of Cryptosporidium spp. and HIV is high, the
key targets of control are the people who are male, younger than 42 years old,
with high level of IL2 and poor personal hygiene habits.

Medicine, Boston, MA, USA. kevin.welch@tufts.edu

BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: The distribution of insecticide-treated bednets (ITNs), 
as an alternative to untreated bednets or no bednet at all, not only directly
prevents the mosquito from biting an individual, but kills the mosquito as well. 
This reduces the mosquito infestation at the household and community levels.
However, barriers may exist limiting the effectiveness of malaria prevention by
these tactics. Objectives of the study were to assess current disparities in
access to ITNs, what factors may be associated with disparities in access and the
progress of antimalaria interventions.
METHODS: This study examined disparities in access to intervention resources
between rural and urban locations by assessing the percentage of households in
each area that has at least one ITN. Demographic Health Survey (DHS) 2005 data
from 16,823 survey respondents from Cambodia were explored, examining the ratio
of households with at least one ITN according to various socioeconomic
determinants. Statistical analysis was done using Chi-square and logistic
regression with SPSS.
RESULTS: Problematic distance from ITN distributors, rural location, and poverty 
were all associated with greater unlikelihood of possession of least one
household ITN.
CONCLUSION: In order to effectively combat high malaria prevalence, interventions
need to be refocused on increasing accessibility to ITNs. The limitations of this
study require further investigation into alternative socioeconomic determinants.

BACKGROUND: Information about the distribution of causes of and time trends for
child mortality should be periodically updated. We report the latest estimates of
causes of child mortality in 2010 with time trends since 2000.
METHODS: Updated total numbers of deaths in children aged 0-27 days and 1-59
months were applied to the corresponding country-specific distribution of deaths 
by cause. We did the following to derive the number of deaths in children aged
1-59 months: we used vital registration data for countries with an adequate vital
registration system; we applied a multinomial logistic regression model to vital 
registration data for low-mortality countries without adequate vital
registration; we used a similar multinomial logistic regression with verbal
autopsy data for high-mortality countries; for India and China, we developed
national models. We aggregated country results to generate regional and global
estimates.
FINDINGS: Of 7·6 million deaths in children younger than 5 years in 2010, 64·0%
(4·879 million) were attributable to infectious causes and 40·3% (3·072 million) 
occurred in neonates. Preterm birth complications (14·1%; 1·078 million,
uncertainty range [UR] 0·916-1·325), intrapartum-related complications (9·4%;
0·717 million, 0·610-0·876), and sepsis or meningitis (5·2%; 0·393 million,
0·252-0·552) were the leading causes of neonatal death. In older children,
pneumonia (14·1%; 1·071 million, 0·977-1·176), diarrhoea (9·9%; 0·751 million,
0·538-1·031), and malaria (7·4%; 0·564 million, 0·432-0·709) claimed the most
lives. Despite tremendous efforts to identify relevant data, the causes of only
2·7% (0·205 million) of deaths in children younger than 5 years were medically
certified in 2010. Between 2000 and 2010, the global burden of deaths in children
younger than 5 years decreased by 2 million, of which pneumonia, measles, and
diarrhoea contributed the most to the overall reduction (0·451 million
[0·339-0·547], 0·363 million [0·283-0·419], and 0·359 million [0·215-0·476],
respectively). However, only tetanus, measles, AIDS, and malaria (in Africa)
decreased at an annual rate sufficient to attain the Millennium Development Goal 
4.
INTERPRETATION: Child survival strategies should direct resources toward the
leading causes of child mortality, with attention focusing on infectious and
neonatal causes. More rapid decreases from 2010-15 will need accelerated
reduction for the most common causes of death, notably pneumonia and preterm
birth complications. Continued efforts to gather high-quality data and enhance
estimation methods are essential for the improvement of future estimates.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to establish factors explaining perinatal
death rates in the city of Lubumbashi.
METHODS: We have carried out a case controlled study in the maternity ward of
Jason Sendwe hospital. Perinatal death cases have been compared to those of
surviving newborn children among parturient women in the course of 2008.
Sociodemographic characteristics, maternal morbidity, children's typical
features, have been studied as independent variables. Their effect on perinatal
mortality has been assessed using an adjusted odds ratio value at a 5% confidence
interval and a logistic regression model.
RESULTS: In total, we considered 2279 births (mother and child pairs) for our
study. Among these were 415 perinatal mortality cases and 1864 control cases.
After adjustment for several parameters, household chores (AOR=1.8; 95%
IC=1.2-2.9), multiple pregnancies (AOR=1.9; 95% IC=1.2-2.9), malaria (AOR=1.4;
95% IC=1.1-1.8), primiparity (AOR=1.7; 95% IC=1.3-2.4), stillbirth (AOR=5.2; 95% 
IC=2.5-11.0) and prematurity (AOR=2.9; 95% IC=1.5-5.5) in previous pregnancies,
onset of antepartum ferver (AOR=3.0; 95% IC=1.2-7.3) and antepartum hemorrhage
(AOR=6.8; 95% IC=3.1-15.0), lack of fetal motions near delivering time, dystocias
(AOR=2.0; 95% IC=1.3-3.0), low birthweight (AOR=15.7; 95% IC=11.2-22.0), very low
birthweight (AOR=49.0; 95% IC=28.6-85.1) and foetal macrosomia (AOR=3.5; 95%
IC=1.8-7.0) were the main factors explaining perinatal mortality.
CONCLUSION: Perinatal mortality in Lubumbashi remains associated with several
avoidable factors. Basic and emergency obstetrical-neonatal care (B-EMONC) should
be improved. Significant efforts should be made in this direction. Perinatal
audits should be established for a good heath care quality follow-up. Obstetrical
care should be offered as a continuum in order to facilitate communication
between the different caregivers.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate risk factors, including reported net use, for
Plasmodium infection and anaemia among school children and to explore variations 
in effects across different malaria ecologies occurring in Kenya.
METHODS: This study analysed data for 49 975 school children in 480 schools
surveyed during a national school malaria survey, 2008-2010. Mixed effects
logistic regression was used to investigate factors associated with Plasmodium
infection and anaemia within different malaria transmission zones.
RESULTS: Insecticide-treated net (ITN) use was associated with reduction in the
odds of Plasmodium infection in coastal and western highlands epidemic zones and 
among boys in the lakeside high transmission zone. Other risk factors for
Plasmodium infection and for anaemia also varied by zone. Plasmodium infection
was negatively associated with increasing socio-economic status in all
transmission settings, except in the semi-arid north-east zone. Plasmodium
infection was a risk factor for anaemia in lakeside high transmission, western
highlands epidemic and central low-risk zones, whereas ITN use was only
associated with lower levels of anaemia in coastal and central zones and among
boys in the lakeside high transmission zone.
CONCLUSIONS: The risk factors for Plasmodium infection and anaemia, including the
protective associations with ITN use, vary according to malaria transmission
settings in Kenya, and future efforts to control malaria and anaemia should take 
into account such heterogeneities among school children.

BACKGROUND: In Côte d'Ivoire, an estimated 767,000 disability-adjusted life years
are due to malaria, placing the country at position number 14 with regard to the 
global burden of malaria. Risk maps are important to guide control interventions,
and hence, the aim of this study was to predict the geographical distribution of 
malaria infection risk in children aged <16 years in Côte d'Ivoire at high
spatial resolution.
METHODS: Using different data sources, a systematic review was carried out to
compile and geo-reference survey data on Plasmodium spp. infection prevalence in 
Côte d'Ivoire, focusing on children aged <16 years. The period from 1988 to 2007 
was covered. A suite of Bayesian geo-statistical logistic regression models was
fitted to analyse malaria risk. Non-spatial models with and without exchangeable 
random effect parameters were compared to stationary and non-stationary spatial
models. Non-stationarity was modelled assuming that the underlying spatial
process is a mixture of separate stationary processes in each ecological zone.
The best fitting model based on the deviance information criterion was used to
predict Plasmodium spp. infection risk for entire Côte d'Ivoire, including
uncertainty.
RESULTS: Overall, 235 data points at 170 unique survey locations with malaria
prevalence data for individuals aged <16 years were extracted. Most data points
(n = 182, 77.4%) were collected between 2000 and 2007. A Bayesian non-stationary 
regression model showed the best fit with annualized rainfall and maximum land
surface temperature identified as significant environmental covariates. This
model was used to predict malaria infection risk at non-sampled locations.
High-risk areas were mainly found in the north-central and western area, while
relatively low-risk areas were located in the north at the country border, in the
north-east, in the south-east around Abidjan, and in the central-west between two
high prevalence areas.
CONCLUSION: The malaria risk map at high spatial resolution gives an important
overview of the geographical distribution of the disease in Côte d'Ivoire. It is 
a useful tool for the national malaria control programme and can be utilized for 
spatial targeting of control interventions and rational resource allocation.

Severe malarial anemia (SMA) is a leading cause of pediatric morbidity and
mortality in holoendemic Plasmodium falciparum transmission areas. Although
dysregulation in cytokine production is an important etiology of SMA, the role of
IFN-α in SMA has not been reported. As such, we investigated the relationship
between IFN-α promoter polymorphisms [i.e., IFNA2 (A-173T) and IFNA8 (T-884A)],
SMA, and functional changes in IFN-α production in children (n = 663; <36 months)
residing in a holoendemic P. falciparum transmission region of Kenya. Children
with SMA had lower circulating IFN-α than malaria-infected children without
severe anemia (P = 0.025). Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed
that heterozygosity at -884 (TA) was associated with an increased risk of SMA [OR
2.80 (95 % CI 1.22-6.43); P = 0.015] and reduced IFN-α relative to wild type (TT;
P = 0.038). Additional analyses demonstrated that carriage of the -173T/-884A
(TA) haplotype was associated with increased susceptibility to SMA [OR 3.98 (95 %
CI 1.17-13.52); P = 0.026] and lower IFN-α (P = 0.031). Follow-up of these
children for 36 months revealed that carriers of TA haplotype had greater
all-cause mortality than non-carriers (P < 0.001). Generation of reporter
constructs showed that the IFNA8 wild-type -884TT exhibited higher levels of
luciferase expression than the variant alleles (P < 0.001). Analyses of
malaria-associated inflammatory mediators demonstrated that carriers of TA
haplotype had altered production of IL-1β, MIG, and IL-13 compared to
non-carriers (P < 0.050). Thus, variation at IFNA2 -173 and IFNA8 -884 conditions
reduced IFN-α production, and increased susceptibility to SMA and mortality.

BACKGROUND: Malaria is a leading cause of mortality, particularly in sub-Saharan 
African children. Prompt and efficacious treatment is important as patients may
progress within a few hours to severe and possibly fatal disease.
Chlorproguanil-dapsone-artesunate (CDA) was a promising artemisinin-based
combination therapy (ACT), but its development was prematurely stopped because of
safety concerns secondary to its associated risk of haemolytic anaemia in
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)-deficient individuals. The objective of 
the study was to assess whether CDA treatment and G6PD deficiency are risk
factors for a post-treatment haemoglobin drop in African children<5 years of age 
with uncomplicated malaria.
METHODS: This case-control study was performed in the context of a larger
multicentre randomized clinical trial comparing safety and efficacy of four
different ACT in children with uncomplicated malaria. Children, who after
treatment experienced a haemoglobin drop≥2 g/dl (cases) within the first four
days (days 0, 1, 2, and 3), were compared with those without an Hb drop
(controls). Cases and controls were matched for study site, sex, age and baseline
haemoglobin measurements. Data were analysed using a conditional logistic
regression model.
RESULTS: G6PD deficiency prevalence, homo- or hemizygous, was 8.5% (10/117) in
cases and 6.8% (16/234) in controls (p=0.56). The risk of a Hb drop≥2 g/dl was
not associated with either G6PD deficiency (adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 0.81;
p=0.76) or CDA treatment (AOR: 1.28; p=0.37) alone. However, patients having both
risk factors tended to have higher odds (AOR: 11.13; p=0.25) of experiencing a Hb
drop≥2 g/dl within the first four days after treatment, however this finding was 
not statistically significant, mainly because G6PD deficient patients treated
with CDA were very few. In non-G6PD deficient individuals, the proportion of
cases was similar between treatment groups while in G6PD-deficient individuals,
haemolytic anaemia occurred more frequently in children treated with CDA (56%)
than in those treated with other ACT (29%), though the difference was not
significant (p=0.49).
CONCLUSION: The use of CDA for treating uncomplicated malaria may increase the
risk of haemolytic anaemia in G6PD-deficient children.

BACKGROUND: Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) has been promoted as a
means to reduce malaria transmission due to their ability to kill both asexual
blood stages of malaria parasites, which sustain infections over long periods and
the immature derived sexual stages responsible for infecting mosquitoes and
onward transmission. Early studies reported a temporal association between ACT
introduction and reduced malaria transmission in a number of ecological settings.
However, these reports have come from areas with low to moderate malaria
transmission, been confounded by the presence of other interventions or
environmental changes that may have reduced malaria transmission, and have not
included a comparison group without ACT. This report presents results from the
first large-scale observational study to assess the impact of case management
with ACT on population-level measures of malaria endemicity in an area with
intense transmission where the benefits of effective infection clearance might be
compromised by frequent and repeated re-infection.
METHODS: A pre-post observational study with a non-randomized comparison group
was conducted at two sites in Tanzania. Both sites used
sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) monotherapy as a first-line anti-malarial from
mid-2001 through 2002. In 2003, the ACT, artesunate (AS) co-administered with SP 
(AS + SP), was introduced in all fixed health facilities in the intervention
site, including both public and registered non-governmental facilities.
Population-level prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum asexual parasitaemia and
gametocytaemia were assessed using light microscopy from samples collected during
representative household surveys in 2001, 2002, 2004, 2005 and 2006.
FINDINGS: Among 37,309 observations included in the analysis, annual asexual
parasitaemia prevalence in persons of all ages ranged from 11% to 28% and
gametocytaemia prevalence ranged from <1% to 2% between the two sites and across 
the five survey years. A multivariable logistic regression model was fitted to
adjust for age, socioeconomic status, bed net use and rainfall. In the presence
of consistently high coverage and efficacy of SP monotherapy and AS + SP in the
comparison and intervention areas, the introduction of ACT in the intervention
site was associated with a modest reduction in the adjusted asexual parasitaemia 
prevalence of 5 percentage-points or 23% (p < 0.0001) relative to the comparison 
site. Gametocytaemia prevalence did not differ significantly (p = 0.30).
INTERPRETATION: The introduction of ACT at fixed health facilities only modestly 
reduced asexual parasitaemia prevalence. ACT is effective for treatment of
uncomplicated malaria and should have substantial public health impact on
morbidity and mortality, but is unlikely to reduce malaria transmission
substantially in much of sub-Saharan Africa where individuals are rapidly
re-infected.

BACKGROUND AND METHODOLOGY: Due to geographic overlap of malaria and visceral
leishmaniasis (VL), co-infections may exist but have been poorly investigated. To
describe prevalence, features and risk factors for VL-malaria co-infections, a
case-control analysis was conducted on data collected at Amudat Hospital, Uganda 
(2000-2006) by Médecins sans Frontières. Cases were identified as patients with
laboratory-confirmed VL and malaria at hospital admission or during
hospitalization; controls were VL patients with negative malaria smears. A
logistic regression analysis was performed to study the association between
patients' characteristics and the occurrence of the co-infection.
RESULTS: Of 2414 patients with confirmed VL, 450 (19%) were positively diagnosed 
with concomitant malaria. Most co-infected patients were males, residing in Kenya
(69%). While young age was identified by multivariate analysis as a risk factor
for concurrent VL and malaria, particularly the age groups 0-4 (odds ratio (OR): 
2.44; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.52-3.92) and 5-9 years (OR: 2.23, 95% CI:
1.45-3-45), mild (OR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.32-0.88) and moderate (OR: 0.45; 95% CI:
0.27-0.77) anemia negatively correlated with the co-morbidity. VL patients
harboring skin infections were nearly three times less likely to have the
co-infection (OR: 0.35; 95% CI: 0.17-0.72), as highlighted by the multivariate
model. Anorexia was slightly more frequent among co-infected patients (OR: 1.71; 
95% CI: 0.96-3.03). The in-hospital case-fatality rate did not significantly
differ between cases and controls, being 2.7% and 3.1% respectively (OR: 0.87;
95% CI: 0.46-1.63).
CONCLUSIONS: Concurrent malaria represents a common condition among young VL
patients living in the Pokot region of Kenya and Uganda. Although these
co-morbidities did not result in a poorer prognosis, possibly due to early
detection of malaria, a positive trend towards more severe symptoms was
identified, indicating that routine screening of VL patients living in malaria
endemic-areas and close monitoring of co-infected patients should be implemented.

BACKGROUND: In Benin, Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS) and long-lasting
insecticidal nets (LLINs) are the cornerstones of malaria prevention. In the
context of high resistance of Anopheles gambiae to pyrethroids, The National
Malaria Control Program (NMCP) has undertaken a full coverage of IRS in a
no-flood zone in the Oueme region, coupled with the distribution of LLINs in a
flood zone. We assessed the impact of this campaign on phenotypic resistance, kdr
(knock-down resistance) and ace-1(R) (insensitive acetylcholinesterase)
mutations.
METHODS: Insecticides used for malaria vector control interventions were
bendiocarb WP (0.4 g/m²) and deltamethrin (55 mg/m²), respectively for IRS and
LLINs. Susceptibility status of An. gambiae was assessed using World Health
Organization bioassay tests to DDT, permethrin, deltamethrin and bendiocarb in
the Oueme region before intervention (2007) and after interventions in 2008 and
2010. An. gambiae specimens were screened for identification of species,
molecular M and S forms and for the detection of the West African kdr (L1014F) as
well as ace-1(R) mutations using PCR techniques.
RESULTS: The univariate logistic regression performed showed that kdr frequency
has increased significantly during the three years in the intervention area and
in the control area. Several factors (LLINs, IRS, mosquito coils, aerosols, use
of pesticides for crop protection) could explain the selection of individual
resistant An. gambiae. The Kdr resistance gene could not be the only mechanism of
resistance observed in the Oueme region. The high susceptibility to bendiocarb is
in agreement with a previous study conducted in Benin. However, the occurrence of
ace-1(R) heterozygous individuals even on sites far from IRS areas, suggests
other factors may contribute to the selection of resistance other than those
exerted by the vector control program.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study have confirmed that An.gambiae have
maintained and developed the resistance to pyrethroids, but are still susceptible
to bendiocarb. Our data clearly shows that selection of resistant individuals was
caused by other insecticides than those used by the IRS and LLINs.

BACKGROUND: Characterizing the breeding site of Anopheles sinensis is of major
importance for the transition from malaria control to elimination in China.
However, little information is available especially regarding the characteristics
and influencing factors of breeding sites of An. sinensis in Yongcheng City, a
representative region of unstable malaria transmission in the Huang-Huai River
region of central China. The aims of this study were to determine the breeding
site characteristics of An. sinensis and related environmental and
physicochemical parameters, to find out which breeding site characteristics could
best explain the presence of An. sinensis larvae, and to determine whether the
breeding habit of An. sinensis has changed or not.
METHODS: Random repeated cross sectional study was undertaken in six villages of 
the Yongcheng city characterized by different levels of the historical incidence 
of P. vivax malaria. The potential breeding sites of An. sinensis larvae in each 
village were examined twice per month both in the household courtyards and the
village surroundings. The larval sampling was done by the standard dipping
method. Some important breeding site characterizations were recorded and
characterized. The anopheline mosquito larvae and emerged adults were identified 
to the species level morphologically and to sub-species by the ribosomal DNA PCR 
technique. Chi-square analysis and logistic regression analysis were applied to
determine the importance of factors for explaining the presence or absence of An.
sinensis larvae.
RESULTS: According to the ribosomal DNA PCR assay, all sampled anopheline
mosquito larvae and emerged adults belonged to An. sinensis. Only 3 containers
that were sampled from the household courtyards were found to contain An.
sinensis larvae. There were no differences in the species composition of mosquito
larvae among containers that contained water in the household courtyards (P >
0.05). An. sinensis larvae were shown to be present in a total of 60 breeding
sites in the village surroundings, this included 8 (13.3%) river fringes, 26
(43.3%) ponds, 23 (38.3%) puddles, and 3 (5.0%) irrigation/drainage ditches.
Logistic regression analysis revealed that the breeding site type, water depth,
chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonia nitrogen, and sulphate were found to be the
key factors determining the presence of An. sinensis larvae. Approximately 94.9% 
of An. sinensis larvae inhabited relatively large and medium-sized water bodies, 
with depths between 0.5 m and 1.0 m (73.3%), COD lower than 2 mg/L (75%), ammonia
nitrogen lower than 0.4 mg/L (86.7%), and sulphate lower than 150 mg/L (58.3%),
respectively.
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that the majority of An. sinensis larval
breeding sites were relatively large and medium-sized water bodies with depths
between 0.5 m and 1.0 m, and containing low levels of COD, ammonia nitrogen, and 
sulphate, respectively. For effective An. sinensis larval control, the type of
breeding site, water depth, COD, ammonia nitrogen, and sulphate should be given
higher priority over other factors in areas where it is the primary vector.

BACKGROUND: Data from the largest randomized, controlled trial for the treatment 
of children hospitalized with severe malaria were used to identify such
predictors of a poor outcome from severe malaria.
METHODS: African children (<15 years) with severe malaria participated in a
randomized comparison of parenteral artesunate and parenteral quinine in 9
African countries. Detailed clinical assessment was performed on admission.
Parasite densities were assessed in a reference laboratory. Predictors of death
were examined using a multivariate logistic regression model.
RESULTS: Twenty indicators of disease severity were assessed, out of which 5
(base deficit, impaired consciousness, convulsions, elevated blood urea, and
underlying chronic illness) were associated independently with death. Tachypnea, 
respiratory distress, deep breathing, shock, prostration, low pH,
hyperparasitemia, severe anemia, and jaundice were statistically significant
indicators of death in the univariate analysis but not in the multivariate model.
Age, glucose levels, axillary temperature, parasite density, heart rate, blood
pressure, and blackwater fever were not related to death in univariate models.
CONCLUSIONS: Acidosis, cerebral involvement, renal impairment, and chronic
illness are key independent predictors for a poor outcome in African children
with severe malaria. Mortality is markedly increased in cerebral malaria combined
with acidosis. Clinical Trial Registration. ISRCTN50258054.

With more vaccines becoming available worldwide, vaccine research is on the rise 
in developing countries. To gain a better understanding of safety reporting from 
vaccine clinical research in developing countries, we conducted a systematic
review in Medline and Embase (1989-2011) of published randomized clinical trials 
(RCTs) reporting safety outcomes with ≥50% developing country participation
(PROSPERO systematic review registration number: CRD42012002025). Developing
country vaccine RCTs were analyzed with respect to the number of participants,
age groups studied, inclusion of safety information, number of reported adverse
events following immunization (AEFI), type and duration of safety follow-up, use 
of standardized AEFI case definitions, grading of AEFI severity, and the
reporting of levels of diagnostic certainty for AEFI. The systematic search
yielded a total number of 50 randomized vaccine clinical trials investigating 12 
different vaccines, most commonly rotavirus and malaria vaccines. In these
trials, 94,459 AEFI were reported from 446,908 participants receiving 735,920
vaccine doses. All 50 RCTs mentioned safety outcomes with 70% using definitions
for at least one AEFI. The most commonly defined AEFI was fever (27), followed by
local (16) and systemic reactions (14). Logistic regression analysis revealed a
positive correlation between the implementation of a fever case definition and
the reporting rate for fever as an AEFI (p=0.027). Overall, 16 different
definitions for fever and 7 different definitions for erythema were applied.
Predefined AEFI case definitions by the Brighton Collaboration were used in only 
two out of 50 RCTs. The search was limited to RCTs published in English or German
and may be missing studies published locally. The reported systematic review
suggests room for improvement with respect to the harmonization of safety
reporting from developing country vaccine clinical trials and the implementation 
of standardized case definitions.

OBJECTIVE: To study the risk factors of schistosomiasis related to household
economic condition and individual behavior in marshland and lake regions, so as
to provide evidences for schistosomiasis control.
METHODS: Six villages were sampled with the stratified cluster sampling method, 2
339 villagers from 1 247 households were surveyed by a questionnaire and
meanwhile their sera were assayed for schistosomiasis by IHA. The Logistic
regression was used to analyze the relationship between the results of
serological examinations and risk factors.
RESULTS: The Logistic regression model fitted well (R2 = 0.598 4) and it
indicated that there existed a regressive relationship between the antibody
positive rate and the endemic situation of village, family economic status, age, 
education level and infection history of schistosomiasis.
CONCLUSION: Suitable measures should be made in according to the local economic
situation, endemic type and population to control the transmission of
schistosomiasis effectively.

and Prevention, WHO Collaborating Centre for Malaria, Schistosomiasis and
Filariasis, Shanghai 200025, China.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the socioeconomic determinants of chronic schistosomiasis
japonica at household level.
METHODS: The socioeconomic status of case and control families in lake and marsh 
schistosomiasis endemic areas were investigated by questionnaire, socioeconomic
factors were analyzed by the principle components analysis, and the wealth index 
were calculated to evaluate the economic status at household level. Then the
relation between schistosome infection and some influencing factors were analyzed
by two-level Logistic regression model.
RESULTS: A total of 2 716 households in 91 villages were investigated, among
which 1 050 were case families and 1 666 were control families. The values of the
first eigenvector of stone/brick house, house with > or = 2 floors, black/white
TV, colour TV, washing machine, refrigerator, side occupation were -0.42, 0.46,
-0.45, 0.46, 0.32, 0.24 and 0.16, respectively, which suggested that the first
eigenvector was the comprehensive index reflecting family wealth. The results of 
Logistic regression model showed that there were 4 household factors
significantly relating to chronic schistosomiasis, namely, the distance from
residence to schistosome-infested water, source of washing water, economic
status, and wet land area per capita, among which the factor that the distance
from residence to schistosome - infested water < 100 m with the highest (OR =
12.590, P = 0).
CONCLUSION: In the lake and marsh endemic areas, health education and other
intervention to the poor family living along river or lake without safe water
supply should be strengthened to control schistosomiasis.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship among the angiopoietin-Tie-2 system,
retinopathy, and mortality in children with cerebral malaria.
DESIGN: A case-control study of retinopathy-positive vs. retinopathy-negative
children with clinically defined cerebral malaria.
SETTING: Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre, Malawi.
SUBJECTS: One hundred fifty-five children presenting with severe malaria and
meeting a strict definition of clinical cerebral malaria (Blantyre Coma Score ≤
2, Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia, no other identifiable cause for coma) were 
included in the study.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Clinical and laboratory parameters were recorded
at admission and funduscopic examinations were performed. Admission levels of
angiopoietin-1, angiopoietin-2, and a soluble version of their cognate receptor
were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We show that angiopoietin-1
levels are decreased and angiopoietin-2 and soluble Tie-2 levels are increased in
children with cerebral malaria who had retinopathy compared with those who did
not. Angiopoietin-2 and soluble Tie-2 were independent predictors of retinopathy 
(adjusted odds ratio [95% CI], angiopoietin-2, 4.3 [1.3-14.6], p = .019; soluble 
Tie-2, 9.7 [2.1-45.8], p = .004). Angiopoietin-2 and soluble Tie-2 were
positively correlated with the number of hemorrhages, the severity or retinal
whitening, and the extent of capillary whitening observed on funduscopic
examination (p < .05 after adjustment for multiple comparisons). Angiopoietin-2
and soluble Tie-2 levels were elevated in children with cerebral malaria who
subsequently died and angiopoetin-2 was an independent predictor of death
(adjusted odds ratio: 3.9 [1.2-12.7], p = .024). When combined with clinical
parameters, angiopoetin-2 improved prediction of mortality using logistic
regression models and classification trees.
CONCLUSIONS: These results provide insights into mechanisms of endothelial
activation in cerebral malaria and indicate that the angiopoietin-Tie-2 axis is
associated with retinopathy and mortality in pediatric cerebral malaria.

BACKGROUND: Intestinal parasite infections (IPIs) are among the most significant 
causes of illness and disease of socially and economically disadvantaged
populations in developing countries, including rural areas of the People's
Republic of China. With the spread of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
among rural Chinese populations, there is ample scope for co-infections and there
have been increasing fears about their effects. However, hardly any relevant
epidemiological studies have been carried out in the country. The aim of the
present survey was to assess the IPI infection status among a representative
sample of HIV-positive Chinese in rural Anhui province, and compare the findings 
with those from a cohort of non-infected individuals.
METHODS: A case control study was carried out in a rural village of Fuyang, Anhui
province, China. Stool samples of all participants were examined for the presence
of intestinal parasites. Blood examination was performed for the HIV infection
detection and anemia test. A questionnaire was administered to all study
participants.
RESULTS: A total of 302 HIV positive and 303 HIV negative individuals provided
one stool sample for examination. The overall IPI prevalence of intestinal
helminth infections among HIV positives was 4.3% (13/302) while it was 5.6%
(17/303) among HIV negatives, a non-significant difference. The prevalence of
protozoa infections among HIV positives was 23.2% while the rate was 25.8% among 
HIV negatives. The species-specific prevalences among HIV positives were as
follows: 3.6% for hookworm, 0.7% for Trichuris trichiura, zero for Ascaris
lumbricoides, 0.3% for Clonorchis sinensis, 1.3% for Giardia intestinalis, 16.2% 
for Blastocystis hominis, 1.7% for Entamoeba spp. and 8.3% for Cryptosporidium
spp.. Cryptosporidium spp. infections were significantly more prevalent among HIV
positives (8.3%) compared to the HIV negative group (3.0%; P < 0.05). Among
people infected with HIV, Cryptosporidium spp. was significantly more prevalent
among males (12.6%) than females (4.4%; P < 0.05). According to multivariate
logistic regression, the factors significantly associated with parasite
infections of the people who were HIV positive included sex (male: OR = 6.70, 95%
CI: 2.030, 22.114), younger age (less than 42 years old: OR = 4.148, 95% CI:
1.348, 12.761), and poor personal hygiene habits (OR = 0.324, 95% CI: 0.105,
0.994).
CONCLUSIONS: HIV positive individuals are more susceptible to co-infections with 
Cryptosporidium spp. than HIV negative people, particularly younger males with
poor personal hygiene habits, indicating a need for targeted hygiene promotion,
IPI surveillance and treatment.

In Uganda malaria causes more morbidity and mortality than any other disease and 
children below 5 years contribute the biggest percentage of malaria related
mortality. Insecticide treated nets (ITNs) are currently one of the most cost
effective option for reducing malaria-related morbidity and mortality, however
the factors affecting their utilization in Uganda are still not well understood. 
This study examined the prevalence and factors associated with ITN utilization
among children of age 0-12 years seeking health care from a Ugandan hospital
using caregiver's reports. A cross sectional design was used to collect data
using a semi-structured questionnaire from 418 participants. Binary logistic
regression was employed to determine predictors of ITN utilization. Results show 
that the prevalence of ITN utilization among children seeking health care was
34.2%. ITN utilization was higher among children of age <5 years [37.0, 95% CI
31.81-42.21] as compared to children aged ≥5 years [22.9, 95% CI 13.77-32.01].
Source of mosquito net (OR = 13.53, 95% CI = 6.47-28.27), formal employment by
head of household (OR = 6.00, 95% CI = 1.95-18.48), sharing a bed with parent (s)
(OR = 2.61, 95% CI = 1.21-5.63) and number of children below 12 years in a
household (OR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.65-0.99), were significant predictors of
utilization. ITN utilization among children was below the set national target.
The predictors identified by this study reveal opportunities that can be taken
advantage of by malaria control programs to achieve the desired rates of
utilization and subsequently malaria prevention in children.

BACKGROUND: In regions of declining malaria transmission, new strategies for
control are needed to reduce transmission and achieve elimination.
Artemisinin-combination therapy (ACT) is active against immature gametocytes and 
can reduce the risk of transmission. We sought to determine whether household
screening and treatment of infected individuals provides protection against
infection for household members.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The study was conducted in two areas in Southern 
Province, Zambia in 2007 and 2008/2009. To determine the impact of proactive case
detection, households were randomly selected either to join a longitudinal
cohort, in which participants were repeatedly screened throughout the year and
those infected treated with artemether-lumefantrine, or a cross-sectional survey,
in which participants were visited only once. Cross-sectional surveys were
conducted throughout the year. The prevalence of RDT positivity was compared
between the longitudinal and cross-sectional households at baseline and during
follow-up using multilevel logistic regression. In the 2007 study area, 174 and
156 participants enrolled in the cross-sectional and longitudinal groups,
respectively. In the 2008/2009 study area, 917 and 234 participants enrolled in
the cross-sectional and longitudinal groups, respectively. In both study areas,
participants and households in the longitudinal and cross-sectional groups were
similar on demographic characteristics and prevalence of RDT positivity at
baseline (2007: OR = 0.97; 95% CI:0.46, 2.03 | 2008/2009: OR = 1.28; 95% CI:0.44,
3.79). After baseline, the prevalence of RDT positivity was significantly lower
in longitudinal compared to cross-sectional households in both study areas (2007:
OR = 0.44; 95% CI:0.20, 0.96 | 2008/2009: OR = 0.16; 95% CI:0.05, 0.55).
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Proactive case detection, consisting of screening
household members with an RDT and treating those positive with ACT, can reduce
transmission and provide indirect protection to household members. A targeted
test and treat strategy could contribute to the elimination of malaria in regions
of low transmission.

The dosage regimen for artemether-lumefantrine which is the standard of care for 
malaria in most of Sub-Saharan countries requires use of treatment guidelines and
instructions to enhance caregivers' performance in the treatment of malaria. As
part of a larger study evaluating its effectiveness in a rural local government
area in southwestern Nigeria, 552 caregivers whose children had fever two weeks
preceeding the survey were recruited. Information was collected with interviewer 
administered questionnaire. A multilevel logistic regression model was fitted
using the gllamm approach in Stata to determine the factors associated with use
of guideline. Age and educational background of caregiver were significantly
associated with guideline use. Caregivers aged 26-30 years were 4 times more
likely to use guideline than those aged >40 years. Caregivers with primary
education were 4 times more likely to use guideline compared with caregivers with
no formal education. Between-village variance was 0.00092 ± 0.3084. Guideline use
reduced with increasing age and lower education.

BACKGROUND: Malaria during pregnancy is a major public health problem in Nigeria 
leading to increase in the risk of maternal mortality, low birth weight and
infant mortality. This paper is aimed at highlighting key predictors of the
ownership of insecticide treated nets (ITNs) and its use among pregnant women in 
Nigeria.
METHODS: A total of 2348 pregnant women were selected by a multi-stage
probability sampling technique. Structured interview schedule was used to elicit 
information on socio-demographic characteristics, ITN ownership, use, knowledge, 
behaviour and practices. Logistic regression was used to detect predictors of two
indicators: ITN ownership, and ITN use in pregnancy among those who owned ITNs.
RESULTS: ITN ownership was low; only 28.8% owned ITNs. Key predictors of ITN
ownership included women who knew that ITNs prevent malaria (OR = 3.85; p <
0001); and registration at antenatal clinics (OR = 1.34; p = 0.003). The use of
ITNs was equally low with only 7.5% of all pregnant women, and 25.7% of all
pregnant women who owned ITNs sleeping under a net. The predictors of ITN use in 
pregnancy among women who owned ITNs (N = 677) identified by logistic regression 
were: urban residence (OR = 1.87; p = 0.001); knowledge that ITNs prevent malaria
(OR = 2.93; p < 0001) and not holding misconceptions about malaria prevention (OR
= 1.56; p = 0.036). Educational level was not significantly related to any of the
two outcome variables. Although registration at ANC is significantly associated
with ownership of a bednet (perhaps through free ITN distribution) this does not 
translate to significant use of ITNs.
CONCLUSIONS: ITN use lagged well behind ITN ownership. This seems to suggest that
the current mass distribution of ITNs at antenatal facilities and community
levels may not necessarily lead to use unless it is accompanied by behaviour
change interventions that address the community level perceptions, misconceptions
and positively position ITN as an effective prevention device to prevent malaria.

Predictors of acute bacterial meningitis (ABM) were assessed in 554 children in
Papua New Guinea 0.2-10 years of age who were hospitalized with culture-proven
meningitis, probable meningitis, or non-meningitic illness investigated by lumbar
puncture. Forty-seven (8.5%) had proven meningitis and 36 (6.5%) had probable
meningitis. Neck stiffness, Kernig's and Brudzinski's signs and, in children < 18
months of age, a bulging fontanel had positive likelihood ratios (LRs) ≥ 4.3 for 
proven/probable ABM. Multiple seizures and deep coma were less predictive (LR =
1.5-2.1). Single seizures and malaria parasitemia had low LRs (≤ 0.5). In
logistic regression including clinical variables, Kernig's sign and deep coma
were positively associated with ABM, and a single seizure was negatively
associated (P ≤ 0.01). In models including microscopy, neck stiffness and deep
coma were positively associated with ABM and parasitemia was negatively
associated with ABM (P ≤ 0.04). In young children, a bulging fontanel added to
the model (P < 0.001). Simple clinical features predict ABM in children in Papua 
New Guinea but malaria microscopy augments diagnostic precision.

To identify factors associated with acute renal failure among patients with
severe falciparum malaria (MARF), we studied 189 severe malaria patients admitted
to the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol
University, in Bangkok, Thailand. Among these, 63 had MARF, and 126 did not.
Baseline clinical demographics and laboratory variables were evaluated with
univariate analysis. Logistic regression was used to ascertain adjusted odds
ratios. By univariate analysis, factors associated with MARF included male
gender, fever duration > 4 days, patients who lived in a non-endemic area prior
to malaria infection, body mass index > 18.5 kg/m(2), oliguria, abdominal pain,
impaired consciousness, jaundice, anemia, liver enlargement, total white blood
cell count > 10x10(9)/1, total bilirubin > 3 mg/dl, aspartate aminotransferase > 
120 U/l, alanine aminotransferase > 120 U/l, albumin < 3 g/dl, fever clearance
time >72 hours, and parasite clearance time > 72 hours. A hemoglobin > 10 g/dl,
patients living in a malaria endemic area, non-oliguria on the day of admission, 
and splenomegaly were negatively associated with MARF. After multivariate
logistic regression, oliguria during the first 24 hours of admission and a
history of living in a nonendemic area prior to malarial infection were factors
associated with MARF. We conclude the most significant factors associated with
MARF were oliguria on the day of admission and living in a non-endemic area prior
to malaria infection.

use? the case of northern Nigeria.

BACKGROUND: Insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) are effective tools for malaria
prevention and can significantly reduce severe disease and mortality due to
malaria, especially among children under five in endemic areas. However, ITN
coverage and use remain low and inequitable among different socio-economic groups
in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in Nigeria. Several strategies have been
proposed to increase coverage and use and reduce inequity in Nigeria, including
free distribution campaigns recently conducted by the Nigerian federal
government. Using data from the first post-campaign survey, the authors
investigated the effect of the mass free distribution campaigns in achieving
equity in household ownership and use of ITNs.
METHODS: A post-campaign survey was undertaken in November 2009 in northern
Nigeria to assess the effect of the campaigns in addressing equity across
different socio-economic groups. The survey included 987 households randomly
selected from 60 clusters in Kano state. Using logistic regression and the Lorenz
concentration curve and index, the authors assessed equity in ITN coverage and
use.
RESULTS: ITN ownership coverage increased from 10% before the campaigns to 70%-a 
more than fivefold increase. The campaigns reduced the ownership coverage gap by 
75%, effectively reaching parity among wealth quintiles (Concentration index
0.02, 95% CI (-0.02 ; 0.05) versus 0.21 95%CI (0.08 ; 0.34) before the
campaigns). ITN use (individuals reporting having slept under an ITN the night
before the survey visit) among individuals from households owning at least one
ITN, was 53.1% with no statistically significant difference between the lowest,
second, third and fourth wealth quintiles and the highest wealth quintile
(lowest: odds ratio (OR) 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.67 ; 1.13);
second: OR 0.85, 95% CI (0.66 ; 1.24); third: OR 1.10 95% CI (0.86 ; 1.4) and
fourth OR 0.91 95% CI (0.72 ; 1.15).
CONCLUSION: The campaign had a significant impact by increasing ITN coverage and 
reducing inequity in ownership and use. Free ITN distribution campaigns should be
sustained to increase equitable coverage. These campaigns should be supplemented 
with other ITN distribution strategies to cover newborns and replace aging nets.

Distance to health services influences insecticide-treated net possession and use
among six to 59 month-old children in Malawi.

BACKGROUND: Health ministries and providers are rapidly scaling up
insecticide-treated nets (ITN) distribution to control malaria, yet possession
and proper use typically remain below targeted levels. In Malawi, health
facilities (HFs) are currently the principal points of ITN distribution, making
it important to understand how access to these ITN sources affects ownership,
possession, and use. The authors evaluated the association between proximity to
HFs and ITN possession or use among Malawian children six to 59 months of age.
METHODS: A household malaria survey undertaken in eight districts of Malawi
during 2007 was used to characterize ITN possession and use. The location of each
respondent's household was geocoded as was those of Ministry of Health (MoH) HFs 
and other health centres. Euclidean distance from each household to the nearest
HF was calculated. Patterns of net possession and use were determined through
descriptive methods. The authors then analysed the significance of distance and
ITN possession/use through standard statistical tests, including logistic
regression.
RESULTS: Median distance to HFs was greater among households that did not possess
ITNs and did not use an ITN the previous evening. Descriptive statistical methods
confirmed a pattern of decreasing ITN possession and use with increasing distance
from HFs. Logistic regression showed the same statistically significant
association of distance to HFs, even when controlling for age and gender of the
child, ratio of nets to children in household, community net possession and use, 
and household material wealth.
CONCLUSIONS: Strategies that exclusively distribute ITNs through HFs are likely
to be less effective in increasing possession and use in communities that are
more distant from those health services. Health providers should look towards
community-based distribution services that take ITNs directly to community
members to more effectively scale up ITN possession and regular use aimed at
protecting children from malaria.

BACKGROUND: Long-lasting insecticide-treated bed nets (LLITN) have demonstrated a
significant effect in reducing malaria-related morbidity and mortality. However, 
barriers on the utilization of LLITN have hampered the desired outcomes. The aim 
of this study was to assess the effect of community empowerment on the burden of 
malaria and anaemia in under-five children in Ethiopia.
METHODS: A cluster randomized trial was done in 22 (11 intervention and 11
control) villages in south-west Ethiopia. The intervention consisted of tailored 
training of household heads about the proper use of LLITN and community network
system. The burden of malaria and anaemia in under-five children was determined
through mass blood investigation at baseline, six and 12 months of the project
period. Cases of malaria and anaemia were treated based on the national protocol.
The burden of malaria and anaemia between the intervention and control villages
was compared using the complex logistic regression model by taking into account
the clustering effect. Eight Focus group discussions were conducted to complement
the quantitative findings.
RESULTS: A total of 2,105 household heads received the intervention and the
prevalence of malaria and anaemia was assessed among 2410, 2037 and 2612
under-five children at baseline, six and 12 months of the project period
respectively. During the high transmission/epidemic season, children in the
intervention arm were less likely to have malaria as compared to children in the 
control arm (OR = 0.42; 95%CI: 0.32, 0.57). Symptomatic malaria also steadily
declined in the intervention villages compared to the control villages in the
follow up periods. Children in the intervention arm were less likely to be
anaemic compared to those in the control arm both at the high (OR = 0.84; 95%CI: 
0.71, 0.99)) and low (OR = 0.73; 95%CI: 0.60, 0.89) transmission seasons.
CONCLUSION: Training of household heads on the utilization of LLITN significantly
reduces the burden of malaria in under-five children. The Ministry of Health of
Ethiopia in collaboration with other partners should design similar strategies in
high-risk areas to control malaria in Ethiopia.

Comment in
    Lancet Infect Dis. 2012 May;12(5):359-60.

BACKGROUND: The effects of malaria and its treatment in the first trimester of
pregnancy remain an area of concern. We aimed to assess the outcome of
malaria-exposed and malaria-unexposed first-trimester pregnancies of women from
the Thai-Burmese border and compare outcomes after chloroquine-based,
quinine-based, or artemisinin-based treatments.
METHODS: We analysed all antenatal records of women in the first trimester of
pregnancy attending Shoklo Malaria Research Unit antenatal clinics from May 12,
1986, to Oct 31, 2010. Women without malaria in pregnancy were compared with
those who had a single episode of malaria in the first trimester. The association
between malaria and miscarriage was estimated using multivariable logistic
regression.
FINDINGS: Of 48,426 pregnant women, 17,613 (36%) met the inclusion criteria:
16,668 (95%) had no malaria during the pregnancy and 945 (5%) had a single
episode in the first trimester. The odds of miscarriage increased in women with
asymptomatic malaria (adjusted odds ratio 2·70, 95% CI 2·04-3·59) and symptomatic
malaria (3·99, 3·10-5·13), and were similar for Plasmodium falciparum and
Plasmodium vivax. Other risk factors for miscarriage included smoking, maternal
age, previous miscarriage, and non-malaria febrile illness. In women with
malaria, additional risk factors for miscarriage included severe or
hyperparasitaemic malaria (adjusted odds ratio 3·63, 95% CI 1·15-11·46) and
parasitaemia (1·49, 1·25-1·78 for each ten-fold increase in parasitaemia). Higher
gestational age at the time of infection was protective (adjusted odds ratio
0·86, 95% CI 0·81-0·91). The risk of miscarriage was similar for women treated
with chloroquine (92 [26%] of 354), quinine (95 [27%) of 355), or artesunate (20 
[31%] of 64; p=0·71). Adverse effects related to antimalarial treatment were not 
observed.
INTERPRETATION: A single episode of falciparum or vivax malaria in the first
trimester of pregnancy can cause miscarriage. No additional toxic effects
associated with artesunate treatment occurred in early pregnancy. Prospective
studies should now be done to assess the safety and efficacy of artemisinin
combination treatments in early pregnancy.

Prescription practices and availability of artemisinin monotherapy in India:
where do we stand?

BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization has urged all member states to deploy
artemisinin-based combination therapy and progressively withdraw oral artemisinin
monotherapies from the market due to their high recrudescence rates and to reduce
the risk of drug resistance. Prescription practices by physicians and the
availability of oral artemisinin monotherapies with pharmacists directly affect
the pattern of their use. Thus, treatment practices for malaria, with special
reference to artemisinin monotherapy prescription, in selected states of India
were evaluated.
METHODS: Structured, tested questionnaires were used to conduct convenience
surveys of physicians and pharmacists in eleven purposively selected districts
across six states in 2008. In addition, exit interviews of patients with a
diagnosis of uncomplicated malaria or a prescription for an anti-malarial drug
were also performed. Logistic regression was used to determine patient clinical
care, and institutional factors associated with artemisinin monotherapy
prescription.
RESULTS: Five hundred and eleven physicians from 196 health facilities, 530
pharmacists, and 1,832 patients were interviewed. Artemisinin monotherapy was
available in 72.6% of pharmacies and was prescribed by physicians for
uncomplicated malaria in all study states. Exit interviews among patients
confirmed the high rate of use of artemisinin monotherapy with 14.8% receiving
such a prescription. Case management, i.e. method of diagnosis and overall
treatment, varied by state and public or private sector. Treatment in the private
sector (OR 8.0, 95%CI: 3.8, 17) was the strongest predictor of artemisinin
monotherapy prescription when accounting for other factors. Use of the
combination therapy recommended by the national drug policy, artesunate +
sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine, was minimal (4.9%), with the exception of one state.
CONCLUSIONS: Artemisinin monotherapy use was widespread across India in 2008. The
accessible sale of oral artemisinin monotherapy in retail market and an
inadequate supply of recommended drugs in the public sector health facilities
promoted its prescription. This study resulted in notifications to all state drug
controllers in India to withdraw the oral artemisinin formulations from the
market. In 2010, artesunate + sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine became the universal
first-line treatment for confirmed Plasmodium falciparum malaria and was deployed
at full scale.

In Senegal, the free distribution of sulfadoxine pyrimethamine during antenatal
care is recommended to remove the disparity in the context of intermittent
preventive treatment against malaria. The objective of this study was thus to
identify factors influencing access to treatment in a situation of abolition of
user fees. It was a cross-sectional and analytical study. It covered a sample of 
1906 women aged 15-49 years randomly selected during the national survey on
malaria in Senegal. Data were collected during a personal interview. The economic
well-being was measured from the characteristics of housing and durable goods.
The multivariate analysis was performed using logistic regression. The average
age was 27.94 ± 5.34, 64.27% resided in rural area and 71.8% had received no
schooling. Among the surveyed women, 23% were in the poorest quintile, while
16.3% were in the richest. Intermittent preventive treatment was performed in
49.3%. IPt were made more in urban areas (OR 1.45 95% [1.17 to 1.72]). It
increased with the level of education with an OR of 1.5 and 1.68 in primary and
secondary. The completion of the IPt increased with economic welfare. The OR
ranged from 1.44 to 2.95 in the second quintile to the richest. Free medication
does not necessarily benefit poor people. Other accompanying measures must be
developed to facilitate the distribution of drugs particularly at community level
with the involvement of people.

Tanzania implemented artemether-lumefantrine (AL) as the first-line treatment for
uncomplicated malaria in November of 2006 because of resistance to
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. AL remains highly efficacious, but widespread use may 
soon facilitate emergence of artemisinin tolerance/resistance, which initially
may be detected at the molecular level as temporal changes in the frequency of
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the Pfmdr-1 gene associated with AL
resistance. In Tanzania, 830 Plasmodium falciparum-positive samples collected
between 2003 and 2010 were examined for SNPs of Pfmdr-1 at codons 86, 184, and
1246. Both the N86 and 184F increased from 2006 to 2010 (logistic regression;
N86: odds ratio [95% confidence interval] = 1.35 [1.07-1.71], P = 0.01; 184F:
odds ratio = 1.42 [1.07-1.88], P = 0.02), and no change was found for D1246 (odds
ratio = 1.01 [0.80-1.28], P = 0.9). The observed changes may be because of
introduction of AL, and if so, this finding gives cause for concern and argues
for continued surveillance of these molecular markers.

Adherence to a six-dose regimen of artemether-lumefantrine among uncomplicated
Plasmodium falciparum patients in the Tigray Region, Ethiopia.

Lemma H(1), Löfgren C, San Sebastian M.

Author information:

BACKGROUND: In 2004, Ethiopia switched its first-line treatment of uncomplicated 
Plasmodium falciparum malaria from sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine to a fixed
artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT), artemether-lumefantrine (AL).
Patient adherence to AL regimen is a major determining factor to achieve the
desired therapeutic outcome. The aim of this study was to measure patient
adherence levels to the six-dose AL regimen for the treatment of uncomplicated P.
falciparum malaria and to identify its determinant factors in rural areas of the 
Tigray region, Ethiopia
METHODS: The study was conducted under routine health service delivery at health 
posts level. Patients/caregivers were not informed about their home visit and
were traced on the day after they finished the AL regimen. By combining the
response to a structured questionnaire and the tablet count from the blister,
adherence level was classified into three categories: definitely non-adherent,
probably non-adherent and probably adherent. Reasons for being definitely
non-adherent were also assessed. For the purpose of examine risk factors,
definitely non-adherent and probably non-adherent was merged into a non-adherent 
group. Variables found significantly associated (p < 0.05) with the adherence
level on the univariate analysis were fitted into a multivariate logistic
regression model.
RESULTS: Out of the total initially enrolled 180 patients, 86.1% completed the
follow-up. Out of these, 38.7% were classified as probably adherent, 34.8% as
probably non-adherent, and 26.5% were definitely non-adherent. The most common
reasons that definitely non-adherents gave for not taking the full dose were "too
many tablets" (37.3%) and to "felt better before finished the treatment course"
(25.5%). The adherence of the patients was associated with the ownership of a
radio (adjusted odd ratio, AOR: 3.8; 95% CI: 1.66-8.75), the belief that malaria 
can be treated traditionally (AOR: 0.09; 95% CI: 0.01-0.78) and a delay of more
than one day in seeking treatment after the onset of fever (AOR: 5.39; 95% CI:
1.83-15.88).
CONCLUSION: The very low adherence to AL found in this study raises serious
concerns for the malaria control in the region. The implementation of a
monitoring adherence system is essential to ensure long-term treatment efficacy.

BACKGROUND: Acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS) are critical illnesses associated with significant morbidity and
mortality.
AIMS: This was designed to assess various etiologies of ALI/ARDS, to determine
the correlation between the diagnostic criteria and need of mechanical
ventilation, and to correlate biochemical factors with the outcome of patients.
SETTINGS AND DESIGN: An observational, prospective study was conducted in a
medical intensive care unit (MICU) of a tertiary care hospital, for a period of 1
year.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study encompassed 58 consecutive cases of ALI/ARDS
admitted to a MICU as per AECC guidelines. Patients excluded were with cardiac
failure, chronic kidney diseases with fluid overload, and age below 12 years.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The data were analysed applying χ2 -test, multivariate
logistic regression analysis of significance, using computer-based program SPSS.
RESULTS: There were more males (74%) than females, and presentation was more
common in the younger age group, with a total mortality of 57%. Factors
attributable for ALI/ARDS were malaria in 16 patients (27.6%), leptospirosis in
12 (20.7%), malaria with dengue in 3 (5.2%), undiagnosed fever in 16 (27.6%),
pneumonia in 8 (13.8%), urinary tract infection in 2 (3.4%), and pancreatitis in 
1 (1.7%) patient. Out of 41 patients with PaO 2 /FiO 2 <200, 40 patients required
invasive ventilation, and out of 17 patients with PaO 2 /FiO 2 >200, 11 patients 
though initially managed on noninvasive ventilation (NIV) subsequently required
invasive ventilation, and remaining six were successfully managed on NIV. Out of 
41 patients requiring mechanical ventilation, 36 had LIS >2.5, whereas only 3 out
of 17 patients with LIS <2.5 required mechanical ventilation.
CONCLUSION: Malaria, leptospirosis, and undiagnosed fever were the main
etiologies followed by pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and pancreatitis.
Both the PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio and lung injury score (LIS) at the time of admission 
were significant predictors of the outcome and of necessity of mechanical
ventilation. PaO 2 /FiO 2 was a better predictor of duration of stay at the
intensive care unit than the LIS. Sepsis, acidosis, hypotension, and multiorgan
failure were individual predictors of mortality in patients with ALI/ARDS while
age, sex, anemia, thrombocytopenia, renal failure, hepatic failure, and X-ray
picture were not predictors of the outcome.

BACKGROUND: Increasing international travel and migration is producing changes in
trends in infectious diseases, especially in children from many European cities. 
The objective of this study was to describe the epidemiology and determine the
trends of imported malaria in patients under 20 years old in the city of
Barcelona, Spain, during an 18-year period.
METHODS: The study included malaria cases that were laboratory confirmed and
reported to the malaria register at the Public Health Agency of Barcelona from
1990 to 2008, residing in Barcelona and less than 20 years old. Patients were
classified as natives (born in Spain) or immigrants. Differences in the
distribution of demographic, clinical characteristics, and incidence per 100,000 
person-year evolution were analysed. Natives and immigrants were compared by
logistic regression by calculating the odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence
interval (CI) and Chi-square for a linear trend (p<0.05).
RESULTS: Of the total 174 cases, 143 (82.1%) were immigrants, 100 (57.5%) were
female, 121 (69.5%) Plasmodium falciparum, and 108 (62.1%) were visiting friends 
and relatives (VFR) as the reason for travel. Among the immigrants, 99 (67.8%)
were from Equatorial Guinea. Immigrant cases more frequently travelled to Africa 
than natives (p=0.02). The factors associated with imported malaria among
immigrant residents was travelling for VFR (OR: 6.2 CI 1.9-20.2) and age 15-19
(OR: 3.7 CI 1-13.3). The incidence increased from 1990 to 1999 (p<0.001) and
decreased from 2000 to 2008 (p=0.01), although the global linear trend was not
statistically significant (p=0.41). The fatality rate was 0.5%.
CONCLUSIONS: The majority of cases of malaria in population less than 20 years in
Barcelona were immigrants, travelling to Africa for VFR and Plasmodium falciparum
was most frequently detected. The trend analysis of the entire study period did
not show a statistically significant decline. It is recommended to be aware of
malaria, especially among children of immigrants who travel to their parent's
home country for VFR. Better access to pre travel advice should be provided.

This analysis presents a comprehensive description of malaria burden and risk
factors in Peruvian Amazon villages where malaria transmission is hypoendemic.
More than 9000 subjects were studied in contrasting village settings within the
Department of Loreto, Peru, where most malaria occurs in the country. Plasmodium 
vivax is responsible for more than 75% of malaria cases; severe disease from any 
form of malaria is uncommon and death rare. The association between lifetime
malaria episodes and individual and household covariates was studied using
polychotomous logistic regression analysis, assessing effects on odds of some vs.
no lifetime malaria episodes. Malaria morbidity during lifetime was strongly
associated with age, logging, farming, travel history, and living with a logger
or agriculturist. Select groups of adults, particularly loggers and
agriculturists acquire multiple malaria infections in transmission settings
outside of the main domicile, and may be mobile human reservoirs by which malaria
parasites move within and between micro-regions within malaria endemic settings. 
For example, such individuals might well be reservoirs of transmission by
introducing or reintroducing malaria into their home villages and their own
households, depending on vector ecology and the local village setting. Therefore,
socio-demographic studies can identify people with the epidemiological
characteristic of transmission risk, and these individuals would be prime targets
against which to deploy transmission blocking strategies along with insecticide
treated bednets and chemoprophylaxis.

Enhanced understanding of infectious diseases by fusing multiple datasets: a case
study on malaria in the Western Brazilian Amazon region.

Valle D(1), Clark JS, Zhao K.

States of America. drv4@duke.edu

BACKGROUND: A common challenge to the study of several infectious diseases
consists in combining limited cross-sectional survey data, collected with a more 
sensitive detection method, with a more extensive (but biased) syndromic sentinel
surveillance data, collected with a less sensitive method. Our article describes 
a novel modeling framework that overcomes this challenge, resulting in enhanced
understanding of malaria in the Western Brazilian Amazon.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A cohort of 486 individuals was monitored using
four cross-sectional surveys, where all participants were sampled regardless of
symptoms (aggressive-active case detection), resulting in 1,383 microscopy and
1,400 polymerase chain reaction tests. Data on the same individuals were also
obtained from the local surveillance facility (i.e., passive and active case
detection), totaling 1,694 microscopy tests. Our model accommodates these
multiple pathogen and case detection methods. This model is shown to outperform
logistic regression in terms of interpretability of its parameters, ability to
recover the true parameter values, and predictive performance. We reveal that the
main infection determinant was the extent of forest, particularly during the
rainy season and in close proximity to water bodies, and participation on forest 
activities. We find that time residing in Acrelandia (as a proxy for past malaria
exposure) decreases infection risk but surprisingly increases the likelihood of
reporting symptoms once infected, possibly because non-naïve settlers are only
susceptible to more virulent Plasmodium strains. We suggest that the search for
asymptomatic carriers should focus on those at greater risk of being infected but
lower risk of reporting symptoms once infected.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The modeling framework presented here combines
cross-sectional survey data and syndromic sentinel surveillance data to shed
light on several aspects of malaria that are critical for public health policy.
This framework can be adapted to enhance inference on infectious diseases
whenever asymptomatic carriers are important and multiple datasets are available.

BACKGROUND: Malaria remains one of the largest public health problems facing the 
developing world. Insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) are an effective intervention
against malaria. ITN delivery through routine health services, such as antenatal 
care (ANC) and childhood vaccination (EPI), is a promising channel of delivery to
reach individuals with the highest risk (pregnant women and children under five
years old). Decisions on whether to deliver ITNs through both channels depends
upon the reach of each of these systems, whether these are independent and the
effectiveness and cost effectiveness of each. Predictors of women attending ANC
and EPI separately have been studied, but the predictors of those who attend
neither service have not been identified.
METHODS: Data from Chad, Mali and Niger demographic and health surveys (DHS) were
analyzed to determine risk factors for attending neither service. A conceptual
framework for preventative health care-seeking behaviour was created to
illustrate the hierarchical relationships between the potential risk factors. The
independence of attending both ANC and EPI was investigated. A multivariate model
of predictors for non-attendance was developed using logistic regression.
RESULTS: ANC and EPI attendance were found to be strongly associated in all three
countries. However, 47% of mothers in Chad, 12% in Mali and 36% in Niger did not 
attend either ANC or EPI. Region, mother's education and partner's education were
predictors of non-attendance in all three countries. Wealth index, ethnicity, and
occupation were associated with non-attendance in Mali and Niger. Other
predictors included religion, healthcare autonomy, household size and number of
children under five.
CONCLUSIONS: Attendance of ANC and EPI are not independent and therefore the
majority of pregnant women in these countries will have the opportunity to
receive ITNs through both services. Although attendance at ANC and EPI are not
independent, delivery through both systems may still add incrementally to
delivery through one alone. Therefore, there is potential to increase the
proportion of women and children receiving ITNs by delivering through both of
these channels. However, modelling is required to determine the level of
attendance and incremental potential at which it's cost effective to deliver
through both services.

BACKGROUND: Although malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) have been extensively 
evaluated since their introduction in the early 1990's, sensitivity and
specificity vary widely limiting successful integration into clinical practice.
This paper reviews specific issues surrounding RDT use in field settings and
presents results of research investigating how to interpret "faint test bands" on
ParaCheck Pf® in areas of low transmission in order to reduce malaria
misdiagnosis.
METHODS: A multi-phase cross-sectional study was conducted at a remote hospital
in the northern Tanzanian highlands. Capillary blood samples were taken from
consenting participants (n = 319) for blood smear and ParaCheck Pf® testing.
Primary outcome variables were sensitivity, specificity and proportion
misdiagnosed by ParaCheck Pf® and local microscopy. ParaCheck Pf® "faint bands"
were classified as both true positives or true negatives during evaluation to
determine appropriate clinical interpretation. Multivariate logistic regression
adjusted for age and gender was conducted to determine odds of misdiagnosis for
local microscopy and ParaCheck Pf®.
RESULTS: Overall, 23.71% of all ParaCheck Pf® tests resulted in a "faint band"
and 94.20% corresponded with true negatives. When ParaCheck Pf® "faint bands"
were classified as positive, specificity was 75.5% (95% CI = 70.3%-80.6%) as
compared to 98.9% (95% CI = 97.0%-99.8%) when classified as negative. The odds of
misdiagnosis by local microscopy for those > 5 years as compared to those ≤ 5
years are 0.370 (95% CI = 0.1733-0.7915, p = 0.010). In contrast, even when
ParaCheck Pf® faint bands are considered positive, the odds of misdiagnosis by
ParaCheck Pf® for those > 5 years as compared to those ≤ 5 years are 0.837 (95%
CI = 0.459-1.547, p = 0.5383).
CONCLUSIONS: We provide compelling evidence that in areas of low transmission,
"faint bands" should be considered a negative test when used to inform clinical
decision-making. Correct interpretation of RDT test bands in a clinical setting
plays a central role in successful malaria surveillance, appropriate patient
management and most importantly reducing misdiagnosis.

BACKGROUND: Access to artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) remains limited
in high malaria-burden countries, and there are concerns that the poorest people 
are particularly disadvantaged. This paper presents new evidence on household
treatment-seeking behaviour in six African countries. These data provide a
baseline for monitoring interventions to increase ACT coverage, such as the
Affordable Medicines Facility for malaria (AMFm).
METHODS: Nationally representative household surveys were conducted in Benin, the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Madagascar, Nigeria, Uganda and Zambia
between 2008 and 2010. Caregivers responded to questions about management of
recent fevers in children under five. Treatment indicators were tabulated across 
countries, and differences in case management provided by the public versus
private sector were examined using chi-square tests. Logistic regression was used
to test for association between socioeconomic status and 1) malaria blood
testing, and 2) ACT treatment.
RESULTS: Fever treatment with an ACT is low in Benin (10%), the DRC (5%),
Madagascar (3%) and Nigeria (5%), but higher in Uganda (21%) and Zambia (21%).
The wealthiest children are significantly more likely to receive ACT compared to 
the poorest children in Benin (OR = 2.68, 95% CI = 1.12-6.42); the DRC (OR =
2.18, 95% CI = 1.12-4.24); Madagascar (OR = 5.37, 95% CI = 1.58-18.24); and
Nigeria (OR = 6.59, 95% CI = 2.73-15.89). Most caregivers seek treatment outside 
of the home, and private sector outlets are commonly the sole external source of 
treatment (except in Zambia). However, children treated in the public sector are 
significantly more likely to receive ACT treatment than those treated in the
private sector (except in Madagascar). Nonetheless, levels of testing and ACT
treatment in the public sector are low. Few caregivers name the national
first-line drug as most effective for treating malaria in Madagascar (2%), the
DRC (2%), Nigeria (4%) and Benin (10%). Awareness is higher in Zambia (49%) and
Uganda (33%).
CONCLUSIONS: Levels of effective fever treatment are low and inequitable in many 
contexts. The private sector is frequently accessed however case management
practices are relatively poor in comparison with the public sector. Supporting
interventions to inform caregiver demand for ACT and to improve provider
behaviour in both the public and private sectors are needed to achieve maximum
gains in the context of improved access to effective treatment.

Insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) are one of the most important and cost-effective 
tools for malaria control. Maximizing individual and community benefit from ITNs 
requires high population-based coverage. Several mechanisms are used to
distribute ITNs, including health facility-based targeted distribution to
high-risk groups; community-based mass distribution; social marketing with or
without private sector subsidies; and integrating ITN delivery with other public 
health interventions. The objective of this analysis is to describe bednet
coverage in a district in western Kenya where the primary mechanism for
distribution is to pregnant women and infants who attend antenatal and
immunization clinics. We use data from a population-based census to examine the
extent of, and factors correlated with, ownership of bednets. We use both
multivariable logistic regression and spatial techniques to explore the
relationship between household bednet ownership and sociodemographic and
geographic variables. We show that only 21% of households own any bednets, far
lower than the national average, and that ownership is not significantly higher
amongst pregnant women attending antenatal clinic. We also show that coverage is 
spatially heterogeneous with less than 2% of the population residing in zones
with adequate coverage to experience indirect effects of ITN protection.

BACKGROUND: In Uganda, malaria and lymphatic filariasis (causative agent
Wuchereria bancrofti) are transmitted by the same vector species of Anopheles
mosquitoes, and thus are likely to share common environmental risk factors and
overlap in geographical space. In a comprehensive nationwide survey in 2000-2003 
the geographical distribution of W. bancrofti was assessed by screening
school-aged children for circulating filarial antigens (CFA). Concurrently, blood
smears were examined for malaria parasites. In this study, the resultant
malariological data are analysed for the first time and the CFA data re-analysed 
in order to identify risk factors, produce age-stratified prevalence maps for
each infection, and to define the geographical patterns of Plasmodium sp. and W. 
bancrofti co-endemicity.
METHODS: Logistic regression models were fitted separately for Plasmodium sp. and
W. bancrofti within a Bayesian framework. Models contained covariates
representing individual-level demographic effects, school-level environmental
effects and location-based random effects. Several models were fitted assuming
different random effects to allow for spatial structuring and to capture
potential non-linearity in the malaria- and filariasis-environment relation.
Model-based risk predictions at unobserved locations were obtained via Bayesian
predictive distributions for the best fitting models. Maps of predicted
hyper-endemic malaria and filariasis were furthermore overlaid in order to define
areas of co-endemicity.
RESULTS: Plasmodium sp. parasitaemia was found to be highly endemic in most of
Uganda, with an overall population adjusted parasitaemia risk of 47.2% in the
highest risk age-sex group (boys 5-9 years). High W. bancrofti prevalence was
predicted for a much more confined area in northern Uganda, with an overall
population adjusted infection risk of 7.2% in the highest risk age-group (14-19
year olds). Observed overall prevalence of individual co-infection was 1.1%, and 
the two infections overlap geographically with an estimated number of 212,975
children aged 5 - 9 years living in hyper-co-endemic transmission areas.
CONCLUSIONS: The empirical map of malaria parasitaemia risk for Uganda presented 
in this paper is the first based on coherent, national survey data, and can serve
as a baseline to guide and evaluate the continuous implementation of control
activities. Furthermore, geographical areas of overlap with hyper-endemic W.
bancrofti transmission have been identified to help provide a better informed
platform for integrated control.

Severe malarial anemia (SMA) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in
children residing in regions where Plasmodium falciparum transmission is
holoendemic. Although largely unexplored in children with SMA, interleukin-18
(IL-18) is important for regulating innate and acquired immunity in inflammatory 
and infectious diseases. As such, we selected two functional single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) in the IL-18 promoter (-137G→C [rs187238] and -607C→A
[rs1946518]) whose haplotypes encompass significant genetic variation due to the 
presence of strong linkage disequilibrium among these variants. The relationship 
between the genotypes/haplotypes, SMA (hemoglobin [Hb], <5.0 g/dl], and
longitudinal clinical outcomes were then investigated in Kenyan children (n =
719). Multivariate logistic regression analyses controlling for age, gender,
sickle cell trait, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, HIV-1,
and bacteremia revealed that carriage of the -607AA genotype was associated with 
protection against SMA (odds ratio [OR] = 0.440 [95% confidence interval {CI} =
0.21 to 0.90], P = 0.031) in children with acute infection. In contrast, carriers
of the -137G/-607C (GC) haplotype had increased susceptibility to SMA (OR = 2.050
[95% CI = 1.04 to 4.05], P = 0.039). Measurement of IL-18 gene expression in
peripheral blood leukocytes demonstrated that elevated IL-18 transcripts were
associated with reduced hemoglobin concentrations (ρ = -0.293, P = 0.010) and
that carriers of the "susceptible" GC haplotype had elevated IL-18 transcripts (P
= 0.026). Longitudinal investigation of clinical outcomes over a 3-year follow-up
period revealed that carriers of the rare CC haplotype (∼1% frequency) had 5.76
times higher mortality than noncarriers (P = 0.001). Results presented here
demonstrate that IL-18 promoter haplotypes that condition elevated IL-18 gene
products during acute infection are associated with increased risk of SMA.
Furthermore, carriage of the rare CC haplotype significantly increases the risk
of childhood mortality.

in Tanzania.

Untreated tropical parasitic co-infections appear to speed the progression of
HIV-1 disease. However, to date, there have been few studies conducted in
resource limited settings to ascertain the interaction of parasitic co-infection 
where HIV/AIDS management largely depends on CD4+ T lymphocyte cells counts and
WHO clinical staging. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of parasites, 
their association with CD4+ T lymphocyte cells changes and clinical manifestation
of HIV-infection in patients attending HIV/AIDS management clinics in Tanzania.
Adult HIV-infected patients registering for the first time at HIV/AIDS management
clinics were recruited; with physical examination and laboratory tests performed 
at baseline and after 6 months. Patients were assigned a clinical stage and
scr.eened for helminths and Plasmodium sp. co-infection, CD4+ T lymphocyte cells,
haemoglobin and HIV-1 p24 antigen. Of the 421 HIV-1 infected patients studied,
198 (47.0%) were co-infected with one or more parasites. Of those studied,
93/421(22.1%) had helminth only co-infection, and 50/421 (12.9%) had Plasmodium
sp only co-infection. Mixed Plasmodium sp and helminth co-inf6ction was diagnosed
in 55/421 (13.0%) patients. Helminths frequently diagnosed included: hookworm
65/421(15.4%), Schistosomiasis 49/421(11.6%), Strongyloides stercoralis
57/421(13.5%), and Ascaris lumbricoides 54/421(12.8%). No statistical association
was found between CD4+ T lymphocyte cells < 200/ 1, or WHO clinical stage III/ IV
with parasite co-infections (AOR 1.2, 95%CI 0.8-1.8). Anaemia was common in
parasite co-infected patients (32.8% vs. 18.8%). Parasite co-infection was
associated with risk of anaemia (AOR 2.1, 95%CI 1.3-3.2). In multivariable
logistic regression analysis, baseline CD4+ T lymphocyte cells <200/V1 was
significantly associated with CD4+ T lymphocyte cells <20041 (AOR 2.4, 95%CI
1.3-4.7) at six months. HIV-1 P24 antigen mean concentration was higher in
parasite co- infected patients (ranges 47.6 to 56.9) as compared to patients
without parasite co-infection (5.5). We have looked at one set of parasites and
found high prevalence of malaria and helminth co-infection in HIV-infected
individuals. Given the available reports on health impacts of helminth
co-infection in HIV/AIDS patients and the anecdotal reports of helminths health
effects in HIV-uninfected persons, helminths and other prevalent parasites should
not be ignored in HIV/AIDS programs. Based on local helminth epidemiology and
HIV-infected cohort specific helminths co-infection prevalence data, mass

BACKGROUND: Following the development of resistance to anti-malarial
mono-therapies, malaria endemic countries in Africa now use artemisinin-based
combination therapy (ACT) as recommended first-line treatment for uncomplicated
malaria. Patients' adherence to ACT is an important factor to ensure treatment
efficacy, as well as to reduce the likelihood of parasite resistance to these
drugs. This study reports adherence to a specific ACT, artemether-lumefantrine
(AL), under conditions of routine clinical practice in Kenya.
METHOD: The study was undertaken in Garissa and Bunyala districts among
outpatients of five government health facilities. Patients treated with AL were
visited at home four days after having been prescribed the drug. Respondents
(patients ≥ 15 years and caregivers of patients < 15 years) were interviewed
using a standardized questionnaire, AL blister packs were physically inspected
and the adherence status of patients was then recorded. Multivariate logistic
regression modelling was used to determine predictors of adherence.
RESULTS: Of the 918 patients included in the study, 588 (64.1%) were 'probably
adherent', 291 (31.7%) were 'definitely non-adherent' and 39 (4.2%) were
'probably non-adherent'. Six factors were found to be significant predictors of
adherence: patient knowledge of the ACT dosing regimen (odds ratio (OR) = 1.76;
95% CI = 1.32-2.35), patient age (OR = 1.65; 95% CI = 1.02-1.85), respondent age 
(OR = 1.37; 95% CI = 1.10-2.48), whether a respondent had seen AL before (OR =
1.46; 95% CI = 1.08-1.98), whether a patient had reported dislikes to AL (OR =
0.62 95% CI = 0.47-0.82) and whether a respondent had waited more than 24 hours
to seek treatment (OR = 0.73; 95% CI = 0.54-0.99).
CONCLUSION: Overall, adherence to AL was found to be low in both Garissa and
Bunyala districts, with patient knowledge of the AL dosing regimen found to be
the strongest predictor of adherence. Interventions aimed at increasing community
awareness of the AL dosing regimen, use of child friendly formulations and
improving health workers' prescribing practices are likely to ensure higher
adherence to AL and eventual treatment success.

BACKGROUND: The Africa Malaria Report shows that many countries are quite far
from reaching the universal coverage targets of 80% coverage by 2010 and maintain
it at this level. This paper examines ITN use and the factors associated with its
adoption among the youths in Nigeria. This information will help in the design of
effective methods of providing and distributing the nets in order to enhance its 
adoption and maximize the public health benefits of ITNs.
METHODS: This cross-sectional survey was carried out in 2006 among university
leavers serving compulsory national service (youth corpers) using total sampling 
technique. The study was conducted using a self-administered questionnaire.
RESULTS: A total of 656 youth corp members were interviewed. Only 23.8% of these 
youths ever use ITN while 4.3% currently use ITN before reporting in camp. A
significant proportion of the youths acquired information on ITN from Mass Media 
(p = 0.0001). Other statistically significant factors that encourage the use of
ITN include inexpensive market price of ITN (p = 0.0001), frequency of Malaria
infestation (p = 0.019) and perceived malaria preventive action of ITN ( p =
0.000).Following logistic regression analysis, perceived effective malaria
preventive action of ITN [OR = 29.3, C.I = 17.17-50.0] and high frequency of
Malaria infestation [OR = 1.55, C.I = 0.97-2.47] were predictors of ITN use.
CONCLUSION: The study shows that the use of ITN for the prevention of Malaria is 
low among these Nigerian youths. The major factors determining the adoption of
ITN among the youths were perceived effective Malaria prevention action of ITN
and high frequency of Malaria attack. These factors should be considered in the
design of sustainable and effective locally relevant strategies for scale-up
adoption of ITNs among a youthful African population.

Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, USA. kmace@cdc.gov

BACKGROUND: In 2007, Malawi replaced the first-line medication for uncomplicated 
malaria, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine-a single-dose regimen-with
artemether-lumefantrine (AL)-a 6-dose, 3-day regimen. Because of concerns about
the complex dosing schedule, we assessed patient adherence to AL 2 years after
routine implementation.
METHODS: Adults and children with uncomplicated malaria were recruited at 3
health centers. We conducted both pill counts and in-home interviews on
medication consumption 72 hours after patients received AL. Complete adherence
was defined as correctly taking all 6 AL doses, as assessed by pill count and
dose recall. We used logistic regression to identify factors associated with
complete adherence.
RESULTS: Of 386 patients, 65% were completely adherent. Patients were
significantly more likely to be completely adherent if they received their first 
dose of AL as directly observed therapy at the health center (odds ratio [OR],
2.4; P < .01), received instructions using the medication package as a visual aid
(OR, 2.5; P = .02), and preferred AL over other antimalarials (OR, 2.7; P <
.001). In contrast, children <5 years of age were significantly less likely to be
adherent (OR, 0.5; P = .05).
CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to AL treatment for uncomplicated malaria was moderate,
and children, who are the most likely to die of malaria, were less adherent than 
adults. Efforts to improve adherence should be focused on this vulnerable group. 
Interventions including the introduction of child-friendly antimalarial
formulations, direct observation of the first dose, use of the AL package as a
visual aid for instructions, and enhancing patient preference for AL could
potentially increase AL adherence and overall effectiveness.

Predictors of mosquito net use in Ghana.

Baume CA(1), Koh AC.

Author information: 
(1)carolbaume@gmail.com

BACKGROUND: During the past decade the malaria control community has been
successful in dramatically increasing the number of households that own mosquito 
nets. However, as many as half of nets already in households go unused. This
study examines the factors associated with use of nets owned in Ghana.
METHODS: The data come from an August 2008 survey in Ghana of households with a
pregnant woman or a guardian of a child under five, conducted during the rainy
season. 1796 households were included in this analysis, which generated a sample 
of 1,852 mosquito nets. Using each net owned as the unit of analysis,
multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the relationship of net used
last night with 23 potentially explanatory variables having to do with
characteristics of the household, of the respondent, and of the net. Odds Ratios,
p-values, and confidence intervals were calculated for each variable to develop
an explanatory model.
RESULTS: The final multivariate model consisted of 10 variables statistically
associated with whether or not the net was used the prior night: rural location, 
lower SES, not using coils for mosquito control, fewer nets in the household,
newer nets and those in better condition, light blue colour, higher level of
education of the guardian of the child under five, knowing that mosquitoes
transmit malaria, and paying for the net instead of obtaining it free of charge.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that net use would increase in
Ghana if coloured nets were made available in mass distributions as well as in
the commercial market; if programmes emphasize that malaria is caused only by
night-biting mosquitoes, and that nets protect against mosquitoes better than
coils and need to be used even if coils are burning; if donated nets are replaced
more frequently so that households have nets that are in good condition; and if
there were support for the commercial market so that those who can afford to
purchase a net and want to choose their own nets can do so.

To compare the quality of antenatal care (ANC) between Community-based Health
Planning and Services (CHPS) and non-CHPS areas in the Birim North District of
Ghana. A cross-sectional study was conducted in May, 2010. We collected data from
600 women (300 from CHPS areas and 300 from non-CHPS areas) recruited from six
CHPS and six non-CHPS areas, using a structured questionnaire. Participants were 
aged 15-49 years, had at least one child within 18 months old, and resided in the
district for at least 2 years before data collection. Outcomes included: (1)
index of ANC utilization (dichotomized as full and partial), (2) receipt of
anti-malarial drugs, (3) testing for HIV infection, and (4) index of knowledge
about pregnancy danger signs (expressed in tertiles). Descriptive statistics and 
multivariate logistic regression methods were employed in the analysis.
Multivariate analysis revealed that participants in the CHPS areas were 2.7 times
(95% CI: 1.66-4.35) more likely to have full utilization score, 4.5 times (95%
CI: 2.37-8.51) more likely to receive HIV testing, and 3.7 times (95% CI:
1.72-7.94) more likely to receive anti-malarial prophylaxis during the ANC
period. However, scoring high on the index of knowledge was not significantly
associated with the CHPS exposure (OR: 1.2; 95% CI: 0.69-2.00). The CHPS
intervention might be useful to improve the quality of ANC. Therefore, increasing
the CHPS intervention coverage in non-CHPS areas might serve as a basis for
improving the quality of ANC in the Birim North and other rural districts of
Ghana.

BACKGROUND: Several sub-Saharan African countries have rapidly scaled up the
number of households that own insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITNs). Although 
the efficacy of ITNs in trials has been shown, evidence on their impact under
routine conditions is limited to a few countries and the extent to which the
scale-up of ITNs has improved population health remains uncertain.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used matched logistic regression to assess the
individual-level association between household ITN ownership or use in children
under 5 years of age and the prevalence of parasitemia among children using six
malaria indicator surveys (MIS) and one demographic and health survey. We used
Cox proportional hazards models to assess the relationship between ITN household 
ownership and child mortality using 29 demographic and health surveys. The pooled
relative reduction in parasitemia prevalence from random effects meta-analysis
associated with household ownership of at least one ITN was 20% (95% confidence
interval [CI] 3%-35%; I² = 73.5%, p<0.01 for I² value). Sleeping under an ITN was
associated with a pooled relative reduction in parasitemia prevalence in children
of 24% (95% CI 1%-42%; I² = 79.5%, p<0.001 for I² value). Ownership of at least
one ITN was associated with a pooled relative reduction in mortality between 1
month and 5 years of age of 23% (95% CI 13-31%; I² = 25.6%, p>0.05 for I² value).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings across a number of sub-Saharan African countries were
highly consistent with results from previous clinical trials. These findings
suggest that the recent scale-up in ITN coverage has likely been accompanied by
significant reductions in child mortality and that additional health gains could 
be achieved with further increases in ITN coverage in populations at risk of
malaria. Please see later in the article for the Editors' Summary.

Risk factor surveillance is a complementary tool of morbidity and mortality
surveillance that improves the likelihood that public health interventions are
implemented in a timely fashion. The aim of this study was to identify population
predictors of malaria outbreaks in endemic municipalities of Colombia with the
goal of developing an early warning system for malaria outbreaks. We conducted a 
multiple-group, exploratory, ecological study at the municipal level. Each of the
290 municipalities with endemic malaria that we studied was classified according 
to the presence or absence of outbreaks. The measurement of variables was based
on historic registries and logistic regression was performed to analyse the data.
Altitude above sea level [odds ratio (OR) 3.65, 95% confidence interval (CI)
1.34-9.98], variability in rainfall (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.40-2.44) and the
proportion of inhabitants over 45 years of age (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.08-0.38) were
factors associated with malaria outbreaks in Colombian municipalities. The
results suggest that environmental and demographic factors could have a
significant ability to predict malaria outbreaks on the municipal level in
Colombia. To advance the development of an early warning system, it will be
necessary to adjust and standardise the collection of required data and to
evaluate the accuracy of the forecast models.

BACKGROUND: Recent estimates of the role of malnutrition on childhood mortality
have led to a call for action by decision makers in the fight against child
malnutrition. Further evaluation is needed to assess the burden of malnutrition
in terms of morbidity and mortality, as well as to assess the impact of various
interventions. The objective of this study is to determine the effect of
malnutrition on mortality in a pediatric service of a rural hospital in Rwanda.
METHODS: A prospective cohort study included children aged 6-59 months coming
from the catchment area of the hospital and admitted to the pediatric ward
between January 2008 and June 2009. Anthropometric, clinical and biological data 
were gathered at the time of admission. The effect of malnutrition at the time of
admission on mortality during hospitalization was analyzed by using logistic
regression.
RESULTS: At the time of admission, the prevalences of wasting, underweight and
stunting among children was 14.2%, 37.5% and 57.3% respectively. Fifty-six
children died during hospitalization. The period mortality rate was 6.9%. After
adjustment for age, sex, malaria thick smear and breathing with chest
retractions, death was associated with underweight and stunting with adjusted
odds rations of 4.6 (IC95% 2.5-8.4) and 4.0 (IC95% 2.0-8.2) respectively.
CONCLUSION: The study confirmed the influence of malnutrition on child mortality 
in pediatrics wards. These results can be of great help for improving the
awareness of the community decision-makers in the fight to prevent malnutrition.

Differential association of KIR gene loci to risk of malaria in ethnic groups of 
Assam, Northeast India.

Receptors encoded within the Natural Killer Cell (NKC) complex and Killer
Immunoglobulin like (KIRs) genomic regions have been suggested to influence
malaria pathogenesis and infection susceptibility. We have examined KIR locus in 
relation to risk of infection and disease in Tea tribes (TT) of Austro Asiatic
affinity and Tibeto-Burman (TB) populations from malaria endemic regions of
Assam. Consistent with differences in their genetic background, KIR gene loci
frequencies differed in studied groups. Surprisingly, KIR3DS1 frequency in TT was
low (17%) and comparable to that reported from African populations. KIR3DL1
frequency was positively associated with malaria severity (Pearson phi, R(2) =
0.297 p = 0.006) and logistic regression modelling predicted KIR3DL1 as a risk
factor in complicated malaria [Odds Ratio (95% C.I)] = [6.39 (1.34-30.60)]. An
interaction between ethnicity and KIR3DL1 was also seen where higher proportion
of KIR3DL1 positive and complicated malaria patients belonged to Tea tribes (p = 
0.009). Notably, four activating genes protected from frequent malaria (p = 0.02)
while six activating genes enhanced the risk of complicated malaria (p = 0.05).
Combination of KIR2DS4, KIR2DS4del, KIR2DS5 negatively influenced disease outcome
in Tea tribes (p = 0.048) but not in Tibeto-Burman. In conclusion our data
indicates KIR gene loci differentially influenced malaria outcome in Tea tribes
and Tibeto-Burman and that four activating genes appeared to provide optimal
activation that protected from frequent episodes of malaria. Our data also
indicated KIR3DS1 to be an ancestral genotype, maintained at low frequency
possibly by malaria in the Austro Asiatic tribes.

Ownership and use of insecticide-treated nets in Oromia and Amhara regional
states of Ethiopia two years after a nationwide campaign.

(1)Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Addis
Ababa University, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the ownership and use of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs)
by the local community 2 years after a free distribution campaign in Ethiopia.
METHODS: This is a population-based survey using a two-stage cluster sample
design in 115 randomly selected clusters in Oromia and Amhara regional states of 
Ethiopia, performed in June 2009. Data on the possession and use of ITNs were
collected using structured and pre-tested questionnaires through house-to-house
visits. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to
examine the effect of participant's malaria knowledge, location and ITN
characteristics on the use of ITNs.
RESULTS: A total of 2874 households participated in the study, and 90.6% of the
study population was knowledgeable about ITNs. About 49.1% of households reported
at least one ITN; 28.4% owned two or more. ITN coverage was significantly lower
in Oromia (34.9%) than in Amhara (76.8%, P<0.001). The average number of ITNs per
ITN-owning household was 1.8. In all surveyed households, only 21.8% of all
family members, 29.4% of all children under the age of 5 years and 23.2% of all
pregnant women had slept under an ITN the night preceding the survey. Among
ITN-owning households, 63.0% of all children under the age of 5 years and 52.1%
of pregnant women had slept under an ITN the night before the survey. Using
multivariate analysis, factors significantly associated with ITN use were number 
of ITNs in the household, number of ITNs hung over the bed in the household,
women's knowledge of ITNs and women's lack of problem in using ITNs, whereas
region, area of residence and ITN status were not.
CONCLUSIONS: Household ITN ownership and use remain below the current Roll Back
Malaria targets of universal coverage. A replacement strategy is urgently needed 
to scale-up coverage and use of ITNs.

Survivorship of Anopheles darlingi (Diptera: Culicidae) in relation with malaria 
incidence in the Brazilian Amazon.

We performed a longitudinal study of adult survival of Anopheles darlingi, the
most important vector in the Amazon, in a malarigenous frontier zone of Brazil.
Survival rates were determined from both parous rates and multiparous
dissections. Anopheles darlingi human biting rates, daily survival rates and
expectation of life where higher in the dry season, as compared to the rainy
season, and were correlated with malaria incidence. The biting density of
mosquitoes that had survived long enough for completing at least one sporogonic
cycle was related with the number of malaria cases by linear regression. Survival
rates were the limiting factor explaining longitudinal variations in Plasmodium
vivax malaria incidence and the association between adult mosquito survival and
malaria was statistically significant by logistic regression (P<0.05). Survival
rates were better correlated with malaria incidence than adult mosquito biting
density. Mathematical modeling showed that P. falciparum and P. malariae were
more vulnerable to changes in mosquito survival rates because of longer
sporogonic cycle duration, as compared to P. vivax, which could account for the
low prevalence of the former parasites observed in the study area. Population
modeling also showed that the observed decreases in human biting rates in the wet
season could be entirely explained by decreases in survival rates, suggesting
that decreased breeding did not occur in the wet season, at the sites where adult
mosquitoes were collected. For the first time in the literature, multivariate
methods detected a statistically significant inverse relation (P<0.05) between
the number of rainy days per month and daily survival rates, suggesting that
rainfall may cause adult mortality.

BACKGROUND: Substantial reductions in malaria have been reported in several
African countries after distribution of insecticide-treated bednets and the use
of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs). Our aim was to assess the
effect of these policies on malaria morbidity, mosquito populations, and
asymptomatic infections in a west African rural population.
METHODS: We did a longitudinal study of inhabitants of Dielmo village, Senegal,
between January, 2007, and December, 2010. We monitored the inhabitants for fever
during this period and we treated malaria attacks with artesunate plus
amodiaquine. In July, 2008, we offered longlasting insecticide
(deltamethrin)-treated nets (LLINs) to all villagers. We did monthly night
collections of mosquitoes during the whole study period, and we assessed
asymptomatic carriage from cross-sectional surveys. Our statistical analyses were
by negative binomial regression, logistic regression, and binomial or Fisher
exact test.
FINDINGS: There were 464 clinical malaria attacks attributable to Plasmodium
falciparum during 17,858 person-months of follow-up. The incidence density of
malaria attacks averaged 5·45 (95% CI 4·90-6·05) per 100 person-months between
January, 2007, and July, 2008, before the distribution of LLINs. Incidence
density decreased to 0·41 (0·29-0·55) between August, 2008, and August, 2010, but
increased back to 4·57 (3·54-5·82) between September and December, 2010--ie,
27-30 months after the distribution of LLINs. The rebound of malaria attacks were
highest in adults and children aged 10 years or older: 45 (63%) of 71 malaria
attacks recorded in 2010 compared with 126 (33%) of 384 in 2007 and 2008
(p<0·0001). 37% of Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes were resistant to deltamethrin in
2010, and the prevalence of the Leu1014Phe kdr resistance mutation increased from
8% in 2007 to 48% in 2010 (p=0·0009).
INTERPRETATION: Increasing pyrethroid resistance of A gambiae and increasing
susceptibility of older children and adults, probably due to decreasing immunity,
caused the rebound and age shift of malaria morbidity. Strategies to address the 
problem of insecticide resistance and to mitigate its effects must be urgently
defined and implemented.

BACKGROUND: Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is common in
populations living in malaria endemic areas. G6PD genotype and phenotype were
determined for malaria patients enrolled in the chlorproguanil-dapsone-artesunate
(CDA) phase III clinical trial programme.
METHODS: Study participants, aged > 1 year, with microscopically confirmed
uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria, and haemoglobin ≥ 70 g/L or
haematocrit ≥ 25%, were recruited into two clinical trials conducted in six
African countries (Burkina Faso, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Tanzania, Mali). G6PD
genotype of the three most common African forms, G6PD*B, G6PD*A (A376G), and
G6PD*A- (G202A, A542T, G680T and T968C), were determined and used for frequency
estimation. G6PD phenotype was assessed qualitatively using the NADPH
fluorescence test. Exploratory analyses investigated the effect of G6PD status on
baseline haemoglobin concentration, temperature, asexual parasitaemia and
anti-malarial efficacy after treatment with CDA 2/2.5/4 mg/kg or
chlorproguanil-dapsone 2/2.5 mg/kg (both given once daily for three days) or
six-dose artemether-lumefantrine.
RESULTS: Of 2264 malaria patients enrolled, 2045 had G6PD genotype available and 
comprised the primary analysis population (1018 males, 1027 females). G6PD
deficiency prevalence was 9.0% (184/2045; 7.2% [N = 147] male hemizygous plus
1.8% [N = 37] female homozygous), 13.3% (273/2045) of patients were heterozygous 
females, 77.7% (1588/2045) were G6PD normal. All deficient G6PD*A- genotypes were
A376G/G202A. G6PD phenotype was available for 64.5% (1319/2045) of patients:
10.2% (134/1319) were G6PD deficient, 9.6% (127/1319) intermediate, and 80.2%
(1058/1319) normal. Phenotype test specificity in detecting hemizygous males was 
70.7% (70/99) and 48.0% (12/25) for homozygous females. Logistic regression found
no significant effect of G6PD genotype on adjusted mean baseline haemoglobin (p =
0.154), adjusted mean baseline temperature (p = 0.9617), or adjusted log mean
baseline parasitaemia (p = 0.365). There was no effect of G6PD genotype (p =
0.490) or phenotype (p = 0.391) on the rate of malaria recrudescence, or
reinfection (p = 0.134 and p = 0.354, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: G6PD deficiency is common in African patients with malaria and until
a reliable and simple G6PD test is available, the use of 8-aminoquinolines will
remain problematic. G6PD status did not impact baseline haemoglobin, parasitaemia
or temperature or the outcomes of anti-malarial therapy.

Pharo, BP60109, 13262 Marseille Cedex 07, France.

BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of anti-vectorial malaria protective measures in
travellers and expatriates is hampered by incorrect compliance. The objective of 
the present study was to identify the determinants of compliance with
anti-vectorial protective measures (AVPMs) in this population that is
particularly at risk because of their lack of immunity.
METHODS: Compliance with wearing long clothing, sleeping under
insecticide-impregnated bed nets (IIBNs) and using insect repellent was estimated
and analysed by questionnaires administered to 2,205 French military travellers
from 20 groups before and after short-term missions (approximately four months)
in six tropical African countries (Senegal, Ivory Coast, Chad, Central African
Republic, Gabon and Djibouti). For each AVPM, the association of "correct
compliance" with individual and collective variables was investigated using
random-effect mixed logistic regression models to take into account the clustered
design of the study.
RESULTS: The correct compliance rates were 48.6%, 50.6% and 18.5% for wearing
long clothing, sleeping under bed nets and using repellents, respectively.
Depending on the AVPM, correct compliance was significantly associated with the
following factors: country, older than 24 years of age, management
responsibilities, the perception of a personal malaria risk greater than that of 
other travellers, the occurrence of life events, early bedtime (i.e., before
midnight), the type of stay (field operation compared to training), the absence
of medical history of malaria, the absence of previous travel in malaria-endemic 
areas and the absence of tobacco consumption.There was no competition between
compliance with the different AVPMs or between compliance with any AVPM and
malaria chemoprophylaxis.
CONCLUSION: Interventions aimed at improving compliance with AVPMs should target 
young people without management responsibilities who are scheduled for
non-operational activities in countries with high risk of clinical malaria. Weak 
associations between compliance and history of clinical malaria or variables that
pertain to threat perception suggest that cognition-based interventions
referencing a "bad experience" with clinical malaria could have only a slight
impact on the improvement of compliance. Further studies should focus on the
cognitive and behavioural predictors of compliance with AVPMs.

associated with susceptibility to severe anaemia in Kenyan children with acute
Plasmodium falciparum malaria.

BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum malaria remains a leading cause of morbidity
and mortality among African children. Innate immunity provides the first line of 
defence against P. falciparum infections, particularly in young children that
lack naturally-acquired malarial immunity, such as the population examined here. 
Consistent with the fact that elevated interleukin (IL)-12 is an important
component of the innate immune response that provides protective immunity against
malaria, we have previously shown that suppression of IL-12 in African children
is associated with the development of severe malarial anaemia (SMA). Since the
role of IL12B variants in conditioning susceptibility to SMA remains largely
unexplored, the association between a single nucleotide polymorphism (1188A→C,
rs3212227), SMA (Hb<6.0 g/dL), circulating IL-12p40/p70 levels, and longitudinal 
clinical outcomes in Kenyan children (n = 756) residing in a holoendemic
falciparum malaria transmission area were investigated.
RESULTS: Multivariate logistic regression analysis in children with acute malaria
(n = 544) demonstrated that carriers of the C allele had increased susceptibility
to SMA (CC: OR, 1.674; 95% CI, 1.006-2.673; P = 0.047, and AC: OR, 1.410; 95% CI,
0.953-2.087; P = 0.086) relative to wild type (AA). Although children with SMA
had lower IL-12p40/p70 levels than the non-SMA group (P = 0.037), levels did not 
differ significantly according to genotype. Longitudinal analyses in the entire
cohort (n = 756) failed to show any significant relationships between rs3212227
genotypes and either susceptibility to SMA or all-cause mortality throughout the 
three year follow-up.
CONCLUSION: The rs3212227 is a marker of susceptibility to SMA in children with
acute disease, but does not appear to mediate functional changes in IL-12
production or longitudinal outcomes during the acquisition of naturally-acquired 
malarial immunity.

Development of protective immunity against Plasmodium falciparum is partially
mediated through binding of malaria-specific IgG to Fc gamma (γ) receptors.
Variations in human FcγRIIA-H/R-131 and FcγRIIIB-NA1/NA2 affect differential
binding of IgG sub-classes. Since variability in FcγR may play an important role 
in severe malarial anemia (SMA) pathogenesis by mediating phagocytosis of red
blood cells and triggering cytokine production, the relationship between
FcγRIIA-H/R131 and FcγRIIIB-NA1/NA2 haplotypes and susceptibility to SMA
(Hb < 6.0 g/dL) was investigated in Kenyan children (n = 528) with acute malaria 
residing in a holoendemic P. falciparum transmission region. In addition, the
association between carriage of the haplotypes and repeated episodes of SMA and
all-cause mortality were investigated over a 3-year follow-up period. Since
variability in FcγR can alter interferon (IFN)-γ production, a mediator of innate
and adaptive immune responses, functional associations between the haplotypes and
IFN-γ were also explored. During acute malaria, children with SMA had elevated
peripheral IFN-γ levels (P = 0.006). Although multivariate logistic regression
analyses (controlling for covariates) revealed no associations between the FcγR
haplotypes and susceptibility to SMA during acute infection, the
FcγRIIA-131H/FcγRIIIB-NA1 haplotype was associated with decreased peripheral
IFN-γ (P = 0.046). Longitudinal analyses showed that carriage of the
FcγRIIA-131H/FcγRIIIB-NA1 haplotype was associated with reduced risk of SMA (RR
0.65, 95% CI 0.46-0.90; P = 0.012) and all-cause mortality (P = 0.002). In
contrast, carriers of the FcγRIIA-131H/FcγRIIIB-NA2 haplotype had increased
susceptibility to SMA (RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.06-2.04; P = 0.020). Results here
demonstrate that variation in the FcγR gene alters susceptibility to repeated
episodes of SMA and mortality, as well as functional changes in IFN-γ production.

Human malaria in the highlands of Yemen.

<title/> Between June 2008 and March 2009, a cross-sectional study of human
malaria was carried out in four governorates of Yemen, two (Taiz and Hodiedah)
representing the country's highlands and the others (Dhamar and Raymah) the
country's coastal plains/foothills. The main aims were to determine the
prevalences of Plasmodium infection among 455 febrile patients presenting for
care at participating health facilities and to investigate the potential risk
factors for such infection. Malarial infection was detected in 78 (17·1%) of the 
investigated patients and was more likely to be detected among the febrile
patients from the highlands than among those presenting in the coastal
plains/foothills (22·6% v.13·9%; χ(2)=10·102; P=0·018). Binary
logistic-regression models identified low household income [odds ratio
(OR)=13·52; 95% confidence interval (CI)=2·62-69·67; P=0·002], living in a
household with access to a water pump (OR=4·18; CI=1·60-10·96; P=0·004) and
living in a household near a stream (OR=4·43; CI=1·35-14·56; P=0·014) as
significant risk factors for malarial infection in the highlands. Low household
income was the only significant risk factor identified for such infection in the 
coastal plains and foothills (OR = 8·20; CI=1·80-37·45; P=0·007). It is unclear
why febrile patients in the highlands of Yemen are much more likely to be found
to have malarial infection than their counterparts from the coastal plains and
foothills. Although it is possible that malarial transmission is relatively
intense in the highlands, it seems more likely that, compared with those who live
at lower altitudes, those who live in the highlands are less immune to malaria,
and therefore more likely to develop febrile illness following malarial
infection. Whatever the cause of the symptomatic malarial infection commonly
found in the highlands of Yemen, it is a matter of serious concern that should be
addressed in the national strategy to control malaria.

risk human papillomavirus prevalence in rural Nigeria.

BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer, caused by persistent infection with carcinogenic
human papillomavirus (HR-HPV), is particularly prevalent in Sub-Saharan Africa
and is associated with a high mortality rate. Some studies in West Africa,
including our own, have found unusually high HR-HPV across all ages with a slight
peak in older women. This increased prevalence at older ages may complicate
screen-and-treat programs, which are implemented in regions where HPV prevalence 
declines with age and typically target women between 30-49 years. A better
understanding of the determinants of high HR-HPV prevalence at older ages is
needed. The goal of this study is to explore risk factors for HR-HPV prevalence
by age among women in our population-based study in Irun, a rural town in
southwestern Nigeria.
METHODS: 1,420 women were administered a clinic-based questionnaire regarding
sexual and reproductive behavior, marital status (including co-wives), and
malaria exposure. Logistic regression compared questionnaire responses and PCR
positivity for a set of 13 carcinogenic HR-HPV types. Results were stratified by 
age (15-29, 30-45, 46-55, and 56+ years).
RESULTS: Birth control use and age at first pregnancy were associated with HR-HPV
(p-value = 0.03 and 0.05, respectively). Early age at sexual debut and multiple
sex partners were risks for HR-HPV, but did not reach significance (p-value = 0.1
and 0.07, respectively). Neither self-reported malaria nor presence of co-wives
in the household was associated with HR-HPV (p-value = 0.85 and 0.24,
respectively). In age sub-categories, early age at sexual debut was a significant
risk factor for HR-HPV among women 35-45 years (p-value = 0.02). Early age at
first pregnancy remained a significant risk factor for women aged 56+ years
(p-value = 0.04). Greater than 2 sex partners and use of birth control were
associated (though not significantly) with HR-HPV in women aged 30-45 (p-value = 
0.08, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: In this high-risk region with elevated HR-HPV prevalence at older
ages, we confirmed previously described, behavioral determinants of HR-HPV. There
was no association with self-reported malaria or co-wives, which we had
hypothesized might correlate with HR-HPV at older ages.

We examined the association between certain clinical factors and aflatoxin
B(1)-albumin adduct (AF-ALB) levels in HIV-positive people. Plasma samples
collected from 314 (155 HIV-positive and 159 HIV-negative) people were tested for
AF-ALB levels, viral load, CD4+ T-cell count, liver function profile, malaria
parasitaemia, and hepatitis B and C virus infections. HIV-positive participants
were divided into high and low groups based on their median AF-ALB of 0.93 pmol
mg(-1) albumin and multivariable logistic and linear regression methods used to
assess relationships between clinical conditions and AF-ALB levels. Multivariable
logistic regression showed statistically significant increased odds of having
higher HIV viral loads (OR=2.84; 95% CI=1.17-7.78) and higher direct bilirubin
levels (OR=5.47; 95% CI=1.03-22.85) among HIV-positive participants in the high
AF-ALB group. There were also higher levels of total bilirubin and lower levels
of albumin in association with high AF-ALB. Thus, aflatoxin exposure may
contribute to high viral loads and abnormal liver function in HIV-positive people
and so promote disease progression.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk factors associated with poor outcome among
under-five children with severe anemia in sub Saharan Africa.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional.
SETTING: University Teaching Hospital, Nigeria.
PARTICIPANTS: Under-five children presenting with severe anemia (PCV <15%, Hb
<5g/dL).
METHODS: Between January and June 2006, children admitted with severe anemia were
recruited. The biodata, socio-economic status, signs and symptoms were documented
for each child after the initial stabilization. Laboratory investigations using
blood, stool and urine samples were carried out. Data were analyzed using SPSS
version 11.0.
RESULTS: 140 out of the 1,450 patients admitted during the period of study had
severe anemia (prevalence 9.7%). Malaria either alone or in combination was the
most common cause of severe anemia [n=90 (64.3%)]. 117 patients (83.6%)
recovered, while 4(2.8%) left against medical advice and 19 died (case fatality
rate 13.6%). The variables associated with mortality were malnutrition (P=0.02), 
tachycardia (P= 0.03), coma (P<0.001), and absence of blood transfusion
(P=0.001). On logistic regression analysis coma (P=0.002), not receiving blood
transfusion (P=0.002) and female gender (P=0.04) predicted poor outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed high mortality rates among under-five children
with severe anemia. Coma, malnutrition, female gender and absence of blood
transfusion were associated with higher mortality in severe anemia.

Environmental factors associated with larval habitats of anopheline mosquitoes
(Diptera: Culicidae) in irrigation and major drainage areas in the middle course 
of the Rift Valley, central Ethiopia.

Author information:

BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Larval control is an integral part of malaria vector
management in Ethiopia and elsewhere. For effective larval control, a sound
understanding of the factors responsible for spatio-temporal variation in larval 
production is essential. A study was thus conducted to characterize larval
habitats of anopheline mosquitoes in irrigation and major drainage areas between 
Adami Tulu and Meki towns, in the middle course of the Ethiopian Rift Valley.
METHODS: Aquatic habitats were sampled for anopheline larvae and the associated
environmental variables (water temperature, turbidity, water current, water pH
and other variables) were measured, characterized and analyzed.
RESULTS: Microscopic identification of the late instars (III and IV) of
anopheline larvae collected throughout the study period yielded nearly 47.6%
Anopheles pharoensis, 32.1% An. arabiensis, 17.1% An. squamosus and only 3.2% of 
other species (An. coustani and An. cinereus). Larvae of the local malaria
vectors, An. arabiensis and An. pharoensis were most abundantly sampled from sand
pools and natural swamps, respectively. Logistic regression analysis detected
four best predictor variables associated with larval abundance of malaria vector 
species. Thus, relative abundance of An. arabiensis larvae was significantly and 
inversely associated with aquatic vegetation and water current, whereas the
relative abundance of An. pharoensis larvae was significantly and positively
associated with water temperature and the presence of algae in the water bodies.
CONCLUSION: Dry season anopheline larval habitats such as riverine sand pools
that are created and maintained by perennial water bodies and their associated
water development projects need to be considered in vector control operations.

on treatment of malaria in an area with declining malaria burden in north-eastern
Tanzania.

BACKGROUND: Despite some problems related to accuracy and applicability of
malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), they are currently the best option in
areas with limited laboratory services for improving case management through
parasitological diagnosis and reducing over-treatment. This study was conducted
in areas with declining malaria burden to assess; 1) the accuracy of RDTs when
used at different community settings, 2) the impact of using RDTs on
anti-malarial dispensing by community-owned resource persons (CORPs) and 3)
adherence of CORPs to treatment guidelines by providing treatment based on RDT
results.
METHODS: Data were obtained from: 1) a longitudinal study of passive case
detection of fevers using CORPs in six villages in Korogwe; and 2)
cross-sectional surveys (CSS) in six villages of Korogwe and Muheza districts,
north-eastern, Tanzania. Performance of RDTs was compared with microscopy as a
gold standard, and factors affecting their accuracy were explored using a
multivariate logistic regression model.
RESULTS: Overall sensitivity and specificity of RDTs in the longitudinal study
(of 23,793 febrile cases; 18,154 with microscopy and RDTs results) were 88.6% and
88.2%, respectively. In the CSS, the sensitivity was significantly lower (63.4%; 
χ2=367.7, p<0.001), while the specificity was significantly higher (94.3%;
χ2=143.1, p<0.001) when compared to the longitudinal study. As determinants of
sensitivity of RDTs in both studies, parasite density of<200 asexual parasites/μl
was significantly associated with high risk of false negative RDTs (OR≥16.60,
p<0.001), while the risk of false negative test was significantly lower among
cases with fever (axillary temperature ≥37.5 °C) (OR≤0.63, p≤0.027). The risk of 
false positive RDT (as a determinant of specificity) was significantly higher in 
cases with fever compared to afebrile cases (OR≥2.40, p<0.001). Using RDTs
reduced anti-malarials dispensing from 98.9% to 32.1% in cases aged ≥5 years.
CONCLUSION: Although RDTs had low sensitivity and specificity, which varied
widely depending on fever and parasite density, using RDTs reduced over-treatment
with anti-malarials significantly. Thus, with declining malaria prevalence, RDTs 
will potentially identify majority of febrile cases with parasites and lead to
improved management of malaria and non-malaria fevers.

BACKGROUND: Malaria kills millions around the world. Until recently it was
believed to be a disease of rural areas, since the Anopheles mosquito, which
transmits Plasmodium species breeds in rural areas. Urban malaria is emerging as 
a potential, but "avertable" crisis, in Africa. In view of the rapidly growing
number of small and medium-sized towns in Ethiopia there is a pressing need to
improve the understanding of the epidemiology of malaria. Therefore, the aim of
this study was to determine malaria prevalence and associated risk factors in
Jimma town.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out in Jimma town from April 1 to
May 28, 2010. 804 study participants were included from 291 households for
microscopic examination of malaria parasites. Socio-demography data and risk
factors were collected using structured questionnaires. Logistic regression
analysis was done using SPSS 15.0 statistical software.
RESULTS: From a total of 804 study participants in current survey only 42 (5.2%) 
were positive for malaria parasites. Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium falciparum and 
mixed infection accounted 71.4%, 26.2% and 2.4%, respectively. Higher malaria
prevalence rate was observed among under-five children (11%). Those who do not
use insecticide-treated bed nets (ITN) were more likely to be infected with
malaria (OR = 13.6; 95% CI 4.9-37.2, p < 0.001) compared with those who use the
ITN. Living in areas where stagnant water existed (OR = 2.1; 95% CI 1.00-4.2, p =
0.047) and its distance of existence <1 km from the house(OR = 2.1; 95% CI
2.0-15.8, p = 0.001) were more likely to be infected with malaria parasite
compared with those who live away from stagnant at a distance greater than 1 km.
CONCLUSION: Malaria is a major health problem with P. vivax becoming a
predominant species in the town. The prevalence was strongly associated with
proximity of residence to potential mosquito breeding sites. Malaria is affecting
significant proportions of the urban settlers and human activities nevertheless
play an important role in bringing the mosquito breeding sites closer to
residences.

BACKGROUND: Malaria has been a major public health problem in Nigeria and many
other sub-Saharan African countries. Insecticide-treated nets have shown to be
cost-effective in the prevention of malaria, but the number of people that
actually use these nets has remained generally low. Studies that explore the
determinants of use of ITN are desirable.
METHODS: Structured questionnaires based on thematic areas were administered by
trained interviewers to 7,223 care-givers of under-five children selected from
all the six geo-political zones of Nigeria. Bivariate analysis and multinomial
logit model were used to identify possible determinants of use of ITN.
RESULTS: Bivariate analysis showed that under-five children whose care-givers had
some misconceptions about causes and prevention of malaria were significantly
less likely to use ITN even though the household may own a net (p < 0.0001).
Education and correct knowledge about modes of prevention of malaria, knowing
that malaria is dangerous and malaria can kill were also significantly associated
with use of ITN (p < 0.0001). Knowledge of symptoms of malaria did not influence 
use of ITN. Association of non-use of ITN with misconceptions about prevention of
malaria persisted with logistic regression (Odds ratio 0.847; 95% CI 0.747 to
0.960).
CONCLUSIONS: Misconceptions about causes and prevention of malaria by caregivers 
adversely influence the use ITN by under-five children. Appropriate communication
strategies should correct these misconceptions.

BACKGROUND: Malaria vector intervention and control programs require reliable and
accurate information about vector abundance and their seasonal distribution. The 
availability of reliable information on the spatial and temporal productivity of 
larval vector habitats can improve targeting of larval control interventions and 
our understanding of local malaria transmission and epidemics. The main objective
of this study was to evaluate two methods of estimating larval habitat
productivity in the western Kenyan highlands, the aerial sampler and the
emergence trap.
METHODS: The study was conducted during the dry and rainy seasons in 2008, 2009
and 2010. Aerial samplers and emergence traps were set up for sixty days in each 
season in three habitat types: drainage ditches, natural swamps, and abandoned
goldmines. Aerial samplers and emergence traps were set up in eleven places in
each habitat type. The success of each in estimating habitat productivity was
assessed according to method, habitat type, and season. The effect of other
factors including algae cover, grass cover, habitat depth and width, and habitat 
water volume on species productivity was analysed using stepwise logistic
regression
RESULTS: Habitat productivity estimates obtained by the two sampling methods
differed significantly for all species except for An. implexus. For for An.
gambiae s.l. and An. funestus, aerial samplers performed better, 21.5 and 14.6
folds, than emergence trap respectively, while the emergence trap was shown to be
more efficient for culicine species. Seasonality had a significant influence on
the productivity of all species monitored. Dry season was most productive season.
Overall, drainage ditches had significantly higher productivity in all seasons
compared to other habitat types. Algae cover, debris, chlorophyll-a, and habitat 
depth and size had significant influence with respect to species.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the aerial sampler is the better of the
two methods for estimating the productivity of An. gambiae s.l. and An. funestus 
in the western Kenya highlands and possibly other malaria endemic parts of
Africa. This method has proven to be a useful tool for monitoring malaria vector 
populations and for control program design, and provides useful means for
determining the most suitable sites for targeted interventions.

in Zambia.

Roll Back Malaria recently recommended a policy of universal coverage with
insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) so that all age groups can benefit from
protection against malaria. Countries adopting the 'universal access' policy
include Zambia. Policy implementation in many settings involves mass distribution
of free ITNs to achieve a measure of universal coverage. This study examines ITN 
deployment and use in the context of mass distribution efforts towards achieving 
universal coverage in a malaria-endemic district in Zambia. We use multiple
logistic regression to identify predictors of ITN deployment and use by anyone in
the household and by children under five. Among ITN-owning households with a
child under five, 69% used at least one ITN the night before the survey. About
half of those children (54%) in ITN-owning households were covered the previous
night. A strong and consistent predictor of use is household deployment of at
least one ITN. Just over half of all ITNs were observed hanging, and reported use
of nets for purposes other than malaria prevention was only 3%. Net
characteristics, including shape, colour and whether or not the ITN was
purchased, were not associated with net deployment. However, ITNs in poor
condition are more likely to be observed hanging than ITNs in new or good
condition. In the context of free mass distribution of ITNs, behaviour change
communication and activities are necessary to improve use. Results suggest
campaigns and messages that persuade recipients to hang up their ITNs would
contribute towards closing the gap between ownership and use.

The role of protective immunity to Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) malaria in Burkitt 
lymphoma (BL) is unknown. We investigated the association between BL and
antibodies reactive to SE36 antigen, a recombinant protein based on P. falciparum
serine repeat antigen 5 gene, targeted by protective malaria immune responses.
Cases were children (0-14 years) enrolled at the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital,
Accra, Ghana, during 1965-1994 with BL confirmed by histology or cytology (92% of
cases). Controls were apparently healthy children enrolled contemporaneous to the
cases from the nearest neighbor house to the case house and were age,-
sex-frequency-matched to the cases. Anti-SE36 IgG antibodies were measured using 
enzyme-linked absorbent immunoassays (ELISAs). SE36 titers were estimated by
extrapolating ELISA optical density readings to a standard fitting curve.
Anti-SE36 titers were log-transformed for analysis. Odds ratios (ORs) and
two-sided 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated using unconditional
logistic regression. The mean log endpoint dilution titers were 0.63 logs lower
in cases than in controls (8.26 [SD 1.68] vs. 8.89 [SD 1.75], Student's t-test, p
= 0.019). Lower titers were observed in cases than controls aged 0-4 years (p =
0.05) and in those aged 5-14 years (p = 0.06). Low and medium tertiles of
anti-SE36 IgG antibodies were associated with increased OR for BL ([OR 1.67, 95% 
CI 1.21-2.31] and [OR 1.33, 95% CI 0.96-1.86], respectively, p(trend) = 0.002) in
analyses adjusting for age, sex, calendar period and test plate. Our findings
suggest that compared to similarly aged children enrolled from the same
community, children with BL in Ghana have lower antibodies to SE36 antigen.

BACKGROUND: Areas that are endemic for malaria are also highly endemic for
hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Nevertheless, it is unknown whether HBV
infection modifies the clinical presentation of malaria. This study aimed to
address this question.
METHODOLOGY AND FINDINGS: An observational study of 636 individuals was performed
in Rondônia, western Amazon, Brazil between 2006 and 2007. Active and passive
case detections identified Plasmodium infection by field microscopy and nested
Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). HBV infections were identified by serology and
confirmed by real-time PCR. Epidemiological information and plasma cytokine
profiles were studied. The data were analyzed using adjusted multinomial logistic
regression. Plasmodium-infected individuals with active HBV infection were more
likely to be asymptomatic (OR: 120.13, P<0.0001), present with lower levels of
parasitemia and demonstrate a decreased inflammatory cytokine profile.
Nevertheless, co-infected individuals presented higher HBV viremia. Plasmodium
parasitemia inversely correlated with plasma HBV DNA levels (r = -0.6;
P = 0.0003).
CONCLUSION: HBV infection diminishes the intensity of malaria infection in
individuals from this endemic area. This effect seems related to cytokine balance
and control of inflammatory responses. These findings add important insights to
the understanding of the factors affecting the clinical outcomes of malaria in
endemic regions.

Lumpur, Malaysia. halkasemi@yahoo.com

BACKGROUND: Malaria remains a significant health problem in Yemen with Plasmodium
falciparum being the predominant species which is responsible for 90% of the
malaria cases. Despite serious concerns regarding increasing drug resistance,
chloroquine is still used for the prevention and treatment of malaria in Yemen.
This study was carried out to determine the prevalence of choloroquine resistance
(CQR) of P. falciparum isolated from Yemen based on the pfcrt T76 mutation.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out among 511 participants from four
governorates in Yemen. Blood samples were screened using microscopic and
species-specific nested PCR based on the 18S rRNA gene to detect and identify
Plasmodium species. Blood samples positive for P. falciparum were used for
detecting the pfcrt T76 mutation using nested-PCR.
RESULTS: The prevalence of pfcrt T76 mutation was 81.5% (66 of 81 isolates).
Coastal areas/foothills had higher prevalence of pfcrt T76 mutation compared to
highland areas (90.5% vs 71.8%) (p = 0.031). The pfcrt T76 mutation had a
significant association with parasitaemia (p = 0.045). Univariate analysis shows 
a significant association of pfcrt T76 mutation with people aged > 10 years (OR =
9, 95% CI = 2.3 - 36.2, p = 0.001), low household income (OR = 5, 95% CI = 1.3 - 
19.5, p = 0.027), no insecticide spray (OR = 3.7, 95% CI = 1.16 - 11.86, p =
0.025) and not sleeping under insecticide treated nets (ITNs) (OR = 4.8, 95% CI =
1.38 - 16.78, p = 0.01). Logistic regression model confirmed age > 10 years and
low household income as predictors of pfcrt T76 mutation in Yemen P. falciparum
isolates.
CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of pfcrt T76 mutation in Yemen could be a
predictive marker for the prevalence of P. falciparum CQR. This finding shows the
necessity for an in-vivo therapeutic efficacy test for CQ. P. falciparum CQR
should be addressed in the national strategy to control malaria.

BACKGROUND: Malaria is a major public health concern in Bangladesh and it is
highly endemic in the Chittagong Hill Tracts where prevalence was 11.7% in 2007. 
One sub-district, Rajasthali, had a prevalence of 36%. Several interventions were
introduced in early 2007 to control malaria. This study was undertaken to
evaluate the impacts of these intensive early stage interventions on malaria in
Bangladesh. This prevalence study assesses whether or not high malaria prevalence
remains, and if so, which areas and individuals remain at high risk of infection.
METHODS AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A 2-stage cluster sampling technique was used to 
sample 1,400 of 5,322 (26.3%) households in Rajasthali, and screened using a
rapid diagnostic test (Falci-vax). Overall malaria prevalence was 11.5%. The
proportions of Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax and infection with both
species were 93.2%, 1.9% and 5.0%, respectively. Univariate, multivariate
logistic regression, and spatial cluster analyses were performed separately. Sex,
age, number of bed nets, forest cover, altitude and household density were
potential risk factors. A statistically significant malaria cluster was
identified. Significant differences among risk factors were observed between
cluster and non-cluster areas.
CONCLUSION AND SIGNIFICANCE: Malaria has significantly decreased within 2 years
after onset of intervention program. Both aspects of the physical and social
environment, as well as demographic characteristics are associated with spatial
heterogeneity of risk. The ability to identify and locate these areas provides a 
strategy for targeting interventions during initial stages of intervention
programs. However, in high risk clusters of transmission, even extensive coverage
by current programs leaves transmission ongoing at reduced levels. This indicates
the need for continued development of new strategies for identification and
treatment as well as improved understanding of the patterns and determinants of
parasitaemia.

BACKGROUND: Understanding the factors which determine a household's or
individual's risk of malaria infection is important for targeting control
interventions at all intensities of transmission. Malaria ecology in Tanzania
appears to have reduced over recent years. This study investigated potential risk
factors and clustering in face of changing infection dynamics.
METHODS: Household survey data were collected in villages of rural Muheza
district. Children aged between six months and thirteen years were tested for
presence of malaria parasites using microscopy. A multivariable logistic
regression model was constructed to identify significant risk factors for
children. Geographical information systems combined with global positioning data 
and spatial scan statistic analysis were used to identify clusters of malaria.
RESULTS: Using an insecticide-treated mosquito net of any type proved to be
highly protective against malaria (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.59-0.96). Children aged five
to thirteen years were at higher risk of having malaria than those aged under
five years (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.01-2.91). The odds of malaria were less for females
when compared to males (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.39-0.98). Two spatial clusters of
significantly increased malaria risk were identified in two out of five villages.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that recent declines in malaria
transmission and prevalence may shift the age groups at risk of malaria infection
to older children. Risk factor analysis provides support for universal coverage
and targeting of long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs) to all age groups.
Clustering of cases indicates heterogeneity of risk. Improved targeting of LLINs 
or additional supplementary control interventions to high risk clusters may
improve outcomes and efficiency as malaria transmission continues to fall under
intensified control.

BACKGROUND: Acute HIV-1 infection (AHI) may present with symptoms for which
urgent healthcare is sought. However, little is known about healthcare seeking
around the time of HIV-1 seroconversion in sub-Saharan Africa.
METHODS: Review of clinical, counselling, treatment and laboratory records of
previously HIV-1 seronegative at-risk adults, followed at monthly or 3-monthly
visits, who seroconverted and enrolled in an AHI cohort. All HIV-seronegative
plasma samples were tested for p24 antigen (p24) and stored preseroconversion
samples for HIV-1 RNA (RNA). Factors associated with malaria treatment while
acquiring HIV-1 were evaluated in multiple logistic regression.
RESULTS: Sixty men and 12 women (95% of 75 seroconverters) were evaluated,
including 43 (60%) with either p24-positive or RNA-positive or HIV-1 discordant
rapid antibodies prior to seroconversion. Prior to diagnosis, 54 patients (75%)
reported fever and 50 (69%) sought urgent care for symptomatic illness, including
23 (32%) who sought care in a nonresearch setting. Twenty-nine patients (40%)
received presumptive malaria treatment. Only 24% of febrile patients were tested 
for malaria parasites. All documented smear results were negative. Malaria
treatment was strongly associated with fever [adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 46, 95% 
confidence interval (CI): 3-725] and nonresearch setting (aOR: 5, 95% CI: 3-64). 
AHI was suspected in six (12%) patients who presented for urgent care during
research evaluation.
CONCLUSIONS: The majority of adults with AHI seek urgent healthcare. These
individuals are often presumptively treated for malaria. Improved recognition of 
AHI in adults presenting for care may offer opportunities for optimizing HIV
prevention strategies.

BACKGROUND: There has been recent large scale-up of malaria control interventions
in Ethiopia where transmission is unstable. While household ownership of
long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN) has increased greatly, there are concerns
about inadequate net use. This study aimed to investigate factors associated with
net use at two time points, before and after mass distribution of nets.
METHODS: Two cross sectional surveys were carried out in 2006 and 2007 in Amhara,
Oromia and SNNP regions. The latter was a sub-sample of the national Malaria
Indicator Survey (MIS 3R). Each survey wave used multi-stage cluster random
sampling with 25 households per cluster (224 clusters with 5,730 households in
Baseline 2006 and 245 clusters with 5,910 households in MIS 3R 2007). Net
ownership was assessed by visual inspection while net utilization was reported as
use of the net the previous night. This net level analysis was restricted to
households owning at least one net of any type. Logistic regression models of
association between net use and explanatory variables including net type, age,
condition, cost and other household characteristics were undertaken using
generalized linear latent and mixed models (GLLAMM).
RESULTS: A total of 3,784 nets in 2,430 households were included in the baseline 
2006 analysis while the MIS 3R 2007 analysis comprised 5,413 nets in 3,328
households. The proportion of nets used the previous night decreased from 85.1%
to 56.0% between baseline 2006 and MIS 3R 2007, respectively. Factors
independently associated with increased proportion of nets used were: LLIN net
type (at baseline 2006); indoor residual spraying (at MIS 3R 2007); and
increasing wealth index at both surveys. At both baseline 2006 and MIS 3R 2007,
reduced proportion of nets used was independently associated with increasing net 
age, increasing damage of nets, increasing household net density, and increasing 
altitude (>2,000 m).
CONCLUSION: This study identified modifiable factors affecting use of nets that
were consistent across both surveys. While net replacement remains important, the
findings suggest that: more education about use and care of nets; making nets
more resistant to damage; and encouraging net mending are likely to maximize the 
huge investment in scale up of net ownership by ensuring they are used. Without
this step, the widespread benefits of LLIN cannot be realized.

Falciparum malaria is an important cause of acute symptomatic seizures in
children admitted to hospitals in sub-Saharan Africa, and these seizures are
associated with neurological disabilities and epilepsy. However, it is difficult 
to determine the proportion of seizures attributable to malaria in endemic areas 
since a significant proportion of asymptomatic children have malaria
parasitaemia. We studied children aged 0-13 years who had been admitted with a
history of seizures to a rural Kenyan hospital between 2002 and 2008. We examined
the changes in the incidence of seizures with the reduction of malaria. Logistic 
regression was used to model malaria-attributable fractions for seizures (the
proportion of seizures caused by malaria) to determine if the observed decrease
in acute symptomatic seizures was a measure of seizures that are attributable to 
malaria. The overall incidence of acute symptomatic seizures over the period was 
651/100,000/year (95% confidence interval 632-670) and it was 400/100,000/year
(95% confidence interval 385-415) for acute complex symptomatic seizures
(convulsive status epilepticus, repetitive or focal) and 163/100,000/year (95%
confidence interval 154-173) for febrile seizures. From 2002 to 2008, the
incidence of all acute symptomatic seizures decreased by 809/100,000/year (69.2%)
with 93.1% of this decrease in malaria-associated seizures. The decrease in the
incidence of acute complex symptomatic seizures during the period was
111/100,000/year (57.2%) for convulsive status epilepticus, 440/100,000/year
(73.7%) for repetitive seizures and 153/100,000/year (80.5%) for focal seizures. 
The adjusted malaria-attributable fractions for seizures with parasitaemia were
92.9% (95% confidence interval 90.4-95.1%) for all acute symptomatic seizures,
92.9% (95% confidence interval 89.4-95.5%) for convulsive status epilepticus,
93.6% (95% confidence interval 90.9-95.9%) for repetitive seizures and 91.8% (95%
confidence interval 85.6-95.5%) for focal seizures. The adjusted
malaria-attributable fractions for seizures in children above 6 months of age
decreased with age. The observed decrease in all acute symptomatic seizures
(809/100 000/year) was similar to the predicted decline (794/100,000/year)
estimated by malaria-attributable fractions at the beginning of the study. In
endemic areas, falciparum malaria is the most common cause of seizures and the
risk for seizures in malaria decreases with age. The reduction in malaria has
decreased the burden of seizures that are attributable to malaria and this could 
lead to reduced neurological disabilities and epilepsy in the area.

BACKGROUND: It is generally agreed that in high transmission areas, pregnant
women have acquired a partial immunity to malaria and when infected they present 
few or no symptoms. However, longitudinal cohort studies investigating the
clinical presentation of malaria infection in pregnant women in stable endemic
areas are lacking, and the few studies exploring this issue are unconclusive.
METHODS: A prospective cohort of women followed monthly during pregnancy was
conducted in three rural dispensaries in Benin from August 2008 to September
2010. The presence of symptoms suggestive of malaria infection in 982 women
during antenatal visits (ANV), unscheduled visits and delivery were analysed. A
multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the association between
symptoms and a positive thick blood smear (TBS).
RESULTS: During routine ANVs, headache was the only symptom associated with a
higher risk of positive TBS (aOR = 1.9; p < 0.001). On the occasion of
unscheduled visits, fever (aOR = 5.2; p < 0.001), headache (aOR = 2.1; p = 0.004)
and shivering (aOR = 3.1; p < 0.001) were significantly associated with a malaria
infection and almost 90% of infected women presented at least one of these
symptoms. Two thirds of symptomatic malaria infections during unscheduled visits 
occurred in late pregnancy and long after the last intermittent preventive
treatment dose (IPTp).
CONCLUSION: The majority of pregnant women were symptomless during routine visits
when infected with malaria in an endemic stable area. The only suggestive sign of
malaria (fever) was associated with malaria only on the occasion of unscheduled
visits. The prevention of malaria in pregnancy could be improved by reassessing
the design of IPTp, i.e. by determining an optimal number of doses and time of
administration of anti-malarial drugs.

Early diagnosis and prompt treatment is the recommended management for febrile
illness among underfives. However, improper home management may be the cause of
delay in seeking professional health care. This cross-sectional study was
conducted at the outpatient department of Buzuruga Health Centre in Mwanza,
Tanzania and involved 372 children < 5 years of age. Socio-demographic data of
caregivers and children, type and source of treatment, and duration of fever were
recorded. A total of 283 (76.1%) febrile underfives had received different types 
of treatment at home, before presenting at the hospital. The majority received
antipyretics (204; 72.1%), and only a few (31; 10.9%) received antimalarials. The
major sources of drugs were local drug stores (270; 94.7%). Duration of fever > 1
day (OR = 2.69; 95% CI: 1.95-3.70; P < 0.001), low grade fever (OR = 4.37, 95%
CI: 2.60-7.35; P < 0.001) and fever accompanied with other major complaints (OR =
1.14, 95% CI: 1.05 - 1.23; P = 0.002) were significantly associated with prompt
home medication before presenting to the health centre. In logistic regression
analysis, duration of fever, low-grade fever and the presence of other symptoms
remained significant predictors to receive antimalarial and or antipyretic drugs.
In conclusion, home treatments with antipyretics and antimalarials in preschool
children are common in Mwanza. Management of fevers may be improved by educating 
caregivers on community standard case definition of malaria while emphasizing the
importance of early seeking of health facility services.

Effect of HIV infection on the acute antibody response to malaria antigens in
children: an observational study.

Institute, PO Box 230, Kilifi, 80108, Kenya.

BACKGROUND: In sub-Saharan Africa, the distributions of malaria and HIV widely
overlap. Among pregnant and non-pregnant adults, HIV affects susceptibility to
malaria, its clinical course and impairs antibody responses to malaria antigens. 
However, the relationship between the two diseases in childhood, when most deaths
from malaria occur, is less clear. It was previously reported that HIV is
associated with admission to hospital in rural Kenya with severe malaria among
children, except in infancy. HIV-infected children with severe malaria were
older, had higher parasite density and increased mortality, raising a hypothesis 
that HIV interferes with naturally acquired immunity to malaria, hence with
little effect at younger ages (a shorter history of exposure). To test this
hypothesis, levels of anti-merozoite and schizont extract antibodies were
compared between HIV-infected and uninfected children who participated in the
original study.
METHODS: IgG responses to malaria antigens that are potential targets for
immunity to malaria (AMA1, MSP2, MSP3 and schizont extract) were compared between
115 HIV-infected and 115 age-matched, HIV-uninfected children who presented with 
severe malaria. The children were classified as high and low responders for each 
antigen and assigned antibody-response breadth scores according to the number of 
antigens to which they were responsive. A predictive logistic regression model
was used to test if HIV was an effect modifier on the age-related acquisition of 
antibody responses, with age as a continuous variable.
RESULTS: Point estimates of the responses to all antigens were lower amongst
HIV-infected children, but this was only statistically significant for AMA1 (P = 
0.028). HIV-infected children were less likely to be high responders to AMA1 [OR 
0.44 (95%CI, 0.2-0.90) P = 0.024]. HIV was associated with a reduced breadth of
responses to individual merozoite antigens (P = 0.02). HIV strongly modified the 
acquisition of antibodies against schizont extract with increasing age (P <
0.0001), but did not modify the rate of age-related acquisition of responses to
individual merozoite antigens.
CONCLUSIONS: In children with severe malaria, HIV infection is associated with a 
lower magnitude and narrower breadth of IgG responses to merozoite antigens and
stunting of age-related acquisition of the IgG antibody response to schizont
extract.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the performance of the Paracheck™ rapid diagnostic test
(RDT) with microscopy for diagnosing malaria in hospitalised children.
METHODS: Children aged between 2 months and 13 years with fever were enrolled in 
the study over 1 year. A standard clinical history and examination were recorded 
and blood drawn for culture, complete blood count, Paracheck™ RDT and double-read
blood slide.
RESULTS: Of 3639 children enrolled, 2195 (60.3%) were slide positive. The
sensitivity and specificity of Paracheck were 97.5% (95% CI 96.9-98.0) and 65.3% 
(95% CI 63.8-66.9), respectively. There was an inverse relationship between
age-specific prevalence of parasitaemia and Paracheck specificity. In logistic
regression model, false-positive Paracheck results were significantly associated 
with pre-admission use of antimalarial drug (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.16-1.78), absence 
of current fever (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.52-0.79) and non-typhi Salmonella bacteraemia
(OR 3.89. 95% CI 2.27-6.63). In spite of high sensitivity, 56/2195 (2.6%) of true
infections were Paracheck negative and 8/56 (14.3%) were in patients with >50,000
parasites/μl.
CONCLUSIONS: Paracheck had poor specificity in diagnosing malaria in severely ill
children; this was likely to be due to HRP2 persistence following recent parasite
clearance. The combination of positive Paracheck and negative blood slide results
identified a group of children at high risk of non-typhi Salmonella infection.
While Paracheck was highly sensitive, some high-density infections were missed.
For children with severe febrile illness, at least two reliable negative
parasitological test results should be available to justify withholding
antimalarial treatment; the optimal choice of these has yet to be identified.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that in areas of seasonal malaria
transmission, intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in children (IPTc),
targeting the transmission season, reduces the incidence of clinical malaria.
However, these studies were conducted in communities with low coverage with
insecticide-treated nets (ITNs). Whether IPTc provides additional protection to
children sleeping under an ITN has not been established.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: To assess whether IPTc provides additional protection to
children sleeping under an ITN, we conducted a randomised, double-blind,
placebo-controlled trial of IPTc with sulphadoxine pyrimethamine (SP) plus
amodiaquine (AQ) in three localities in Kati, Mali. After screening, eligible
children aged 3-59 mo were given a long-lasting insecticide-treated net (LLIN)
and randomised to receive three rounds of active drugs or placebos. Treatments
were administered under observation at monthly intervals during the high malaria 
transmission season in August, September, and October 2008. Adverse events were
monitored immediately after the administration of each course of IPTc and
throughout the follow-up period. The primary endpoint was clinical episodes of
malaria recorded through passive surveillance by study clinicians available at
all times during the follow-up. Cross-sectional surveys were conducted in 150
randomly selected children weekly and in all children at the end of the malaria
transmission season to assess usage of ITNs and the impact of IPTc on the
prevalence of malaria, anaemia, and malnutrition. Cox regression was used to
compare incidence rates between intervention and control arms. The effects of
IPTc on the prevalence of malaria infection and anaemia were estimated using
logistic regression. 3,065 children were screened and 3,017 (1,508 in the control
and 1,509 in the intervention arm) were enrolled in the study. 1,485 children
(98.5%) in the control arm and 1,481 (98.1%) in the intervention arm completed
follow-up. During the intervention period, the proportion of children reported to
have slept under an ITN was 99.7% in the control and 99.3% in intervention arm (p
= 0.45). A total of 672 episodes of clinical malaria defined as fever or a
history of fever and the presence of at least 5,000 asexual forms of Plasmodium
falciparum per microlitre (incidence rate of 1.90; 95% confidence interval [CI]
1.76-2.05 episodes per person year) were observed in the control arm versus 126
(incidence rate of 0.34; 95% CI 0.29-0.41 episodes per person year) in the
intervention arm, indicating a protective effect (PE) of 82% (95% CI 78%-85%)
(p<0.001) on the primary endpoint. There were 15 episodes of severe malaria in
children in the control arm compared to two in children in the intervention group
giving a PE of 87% (95% CI 42%-99%) (p = 0.001). IPTc reduced the prevalence of
malaria infection by 85% (95% CI 73%-92%) (p<0.001) during the intervention
period and by 46% (95% CI 31%-68%) (p<0.001) at the end of the intervention
period. The prevalence of moderate anaemia (haemoglobin [Hb] <8 g/dl) was reduced
by 47% (95% CI 15%-67%) (p<0.007) at the end of intervention period. The
frequencies of adverse events were similar between the two arms. There was no
drug-related serious adverse event.
CONCLUSIONS: IPTc given during the malaria transmission season provided
substantial protection against clinical episodes of malaria, malaria infection,
and anaemia in children using an LLIN. SP+AQ was safe and well tolerated. These
findings indicate that IPTc could make a valuable contribution to malaria control
in areas of seasonal malaria transmission alongside other interventions.

On the validity of self-reports and indirect reports to ascertain malaria
prevalence in settings of hypoendemicity.

University, Montréal, QC, Canada.

Self-reports are commonly used to ascertain malaria prevalence in epidemiological
studies conducted in settings where laboratory diagnosis is impractical. Most
studies, however, do not use self-report per se, but indirect report, where one
respondent provides responses for all household members. Studies also vary in
terms of the time frame used for this ascertainment. The aim of our research was 
to determine the validity of self-report and indirect report in ascertaining
malaria prevalence over six, eighteen and thirty-month time periods. Reports of
malaria episodes collected through interviewer-administered questionnaires (193
self-reports, 614 indirect reports) were compared to microscopy-confirmed cases
(principally Plasmodium vivax) registered at a government-run health post in the 
Peruvian Amazon. Test parameters were estimated using a Bayesian latent class
approach for imperfect gold standards. Logistic regression analyses were
performed to explore determinants associated with accurate responses. Malaria
self-report for the thirty-month period prevalence had the highest sensitivity
(91.0%). Specificity was maximized when malaria prevalence was measured over the 
last six months for both self-report (91.6%) and indirect report (96.7%).
Accuracy was highest for the six-month period prevalence in both self-report
(91.3%) and indirect report (96.4%). Respondents who were female, had more
education, or who provided a report on behalf of a child ≤ 12 years of age, were 
generally more accurate. Both self-report and indirect report provides accurate
estimates of malaria prevalence, especially over shorter periods of time. The
choice between self-report and indirect report should ultimately depend on the
research question and the target study population.

BACKGROUND: Maternal human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) RNA load, CD4 cell count,
breast-feeding, antiretroviral use, and malaria are well-established factors
associated with mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV; the role of maternal 
tuberculosis (TB), however, has not been well established.
METHODS: The study population was 783 HIV-infected Indian mother-infant pair
participants in randomized and ancillary HIV-infected cohorts of the Six Week
Extended-Dose Nevirapine (SWEN) Study, a study comparing extended nevirapine
versus single-dose nevirapine, to reduce MTCT of HIV among breast-fed infants.
Using multivariable logistic regression, we assessed the impact of maternal TB
occurring during pregnancy and through 12 months after delivery on risk of MTCT.
RESULTS: Of 783 mothers, 3 had prevalent TB and 30 had incident TB at 12 months
after delivery. Of 33 mothers with TB, 10 (30%) transmitted HIV to their infants 
in comparison with 87 of 750 mothers without TB (12%; odds ratio [OR], 3.31; 95% 
confidence interval [CI], 1.53-7.29; P = .02). In multivariable analysis,
maternal TB was associated with 2.51-fold (95% CI, 1.05-6.02; P = .04) increased 
odds of HIV transmission adjusting for maternal factors (viral load, CD4 cell
count, and antiretroviral therapy) and infant factors (breast-feeding duration,
infant nevirapine administration, gestational age, and birth weight) associated
with MTCT of HIV.
CONCLUSIONS: Maternal TB is associated with increased MTCT of HIV. Prevention of 
TB among HIV-infected mothers should be a high priority for communities with
significant HIV/TB burden.

Anaemia during pregnancy is associated with negative maternal and neonatal
outcomes. However, there is limited data regarding prevalence and effects of
anaemia during pregnancy in northern Tanzania. The objective of this study was to
determine the prevalence and possible risk factors for anaemia and its effect on 
perinatal outcomes among pregnant women attending antenatal care in Moshi
Municipality in northern Tanzania. A cohort of pregnant women aged 14-43 years
and in their 3rd trimester, was recruited from two primary health care clinics
between June 2002 and March 2004. Interviews, anthropometric measurements and
haematological examinations were conducted on 2654 consenting women. Perinatal
outcomes were recorded during delivery and at 1 week after delivery. Of the 2654 
participants, 47.4% had anaemia (haemoglobin [Hb] <11g/dl), 35.3% had mild
anaemia (Hb= 9-10.9g/dl), 9.9% had moderate anaemia (Hb =7- 8.9g/dl), and 2.1%
had severe anaemia (Hb < 7 g/dl). Anaemia was significantly more prevalent in
HIV-positive (56.4%) than in HIV-negative women (46.7%), (P = 0.01). In logistic 
regression anaemia was independently associated with maternal HIV (OR= 1.5),
malaria (OR= 5.2), clinic of recruitment (OR= 1.5) and low income (OR= 1.9).
Pregnant women with anaemia were more likely to have low birth weight (LBW)
infants. Compared with non-anaemic women, the risk of LBW was 1.6 times and 4.8
times higher for children born to women with moderate and severe anaemia,
respectively. In conclusion, anaemia in pregnancy is a severe public health
problem in northern Tanzania. Control of maternal anaemia may be one important
strategy to prevent LBW in this setting. Measures to prevent malaria and to
control anaemia among all pregnant women irrespective of HIV status, should be
strengthened. Outside of the health sector broader approaches for anaemia
prevention targeting women of lower income, are required.

BACKGROUND: Febrile malaria is the most common clinical manifestation of P.
falciparum infection, and is often the primary endpoint in clinical trials and
epidemiological studies. Subjective and objective fevers are both used to define 
the endpoint, but have not been carefully compared, and the relative incidence of
clinical malaria by active and passive case detection is unknown.
METHODS: We analyzed data from cohorts under active and passive surveillance,
including 19,462 presentations with fever and 5,551 blood tests for asymptomatic 
parasitaemia. A logistic regression model was used to calculate Malaria
Attributable Fractions (MAFs) for various case definitions. Incidences of febrile
malaria by active and passive surveillance were compared in a subset of children 
matched for age and location.
RESULTS: Active surveillance identified three times the incidence of clinical
malaria as passive surveillance in a subset of children matched for age and
location. Objective fever (temperature≥37.5°C) gave consistently higher MAFs than
case definitions based on subjective fever.
CONCLUSION: The endpoints from active and passive surveillance have high
specificity, but the incidence of endpoints is lower on passive surveillance.
Subjective fever had low specificity and should not be used in primary endpoint. 
Passive surveillance will reduce the power of clinical trials but may
cost-effectively deliver acceptable sensitivity in studies of large populations.

Is staying overnight in a farming hut a risk factor for malaria infection in a
setting with insecticide-treated bed nets in rural Laos?

BACKGROUND: Overnight stays in farming huts are known to pose a risk of malaria
infection. However, studies reporting the risk were conducted in the settings of 
poor net coverage. This study sought to assess whether an overnight stay in a
farming hut is associated with an increased risk of malaria infection if
insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) are properly used.
METHODS: A pair of cross-sectional surveys was carried out in the Lamarm district
of Sekong province, Laos, in March (dry season) and August (rainy season) in
2008. Questionnaire-based interviews and blood examinations were conducted with
farmers and their household members from three randomly selected villages in
March (127 households, 891 people) and August (128 households, 919 people).
Logistic regression analysis, adjusted for potential confounding factors, was
used to assess the association between malaria infection status and frequency of 
overnight stays for the two weeks prior to the study in both the seasons.
RESULTS: In March, 13.7% of participants reported staying overnight in a farming 
hut at least once in the previous two weeks. The percentage increased to 74.6% in
August. Not only adults but also young children stayed overnight as often as
adults. The use of an ITN the preceding night was common both in farming huts
(66.3% in March, 95.2% in August), and in main residences (85.8% in March, 92.5% 
in August). Logistic regression analysis showed no statistical association
between malaria infection status and frequency of overnight stays in farming huts
in either study period. However, people sharing one family type net with five
people or more were significantly more likely to have malaria than those sharing 
a net with up to two people in the dry season.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that staying overnight in farming huts was not
associated with an increased risk of malaria infection in the setting where ITNs 
were widely used in farming huts. It suggests that malaria infection during
overnight stays in farming huts might be preventable if ITNs are properly used in
rural Laos.

BACKGROUND: The consequences of temporary predonation deferral are
unsatisfactorily understood. Studies have found that deferral negatively impacts 
future donor return. However, the applicability of these findings across centers 
has not been established.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Using a cohort design, presenting donors with a
temporary deferral in 2006 to 2008 in one of six categories (low hematocrit
[Hct], blood pressure or pulse, feeling unwell, malaria travel, tattoos or
piercing and related exposures, or could not wait or second thoughts) were
passively followed for up to a 3-year period for the time to first return after
deferral expiration at six US blood centers. Time-to-event methods were used to
assess return. We also analyzed which donor characteristics were associated with 
return using multivariable logistic regression.
RESULTS: Of 3.9 million donor presentations, 505,623 resulted in deferral in the 
six categories. Low Hct was the most common deferral, had the shortest median
time to return (time in days when 50% of deferred donors had returned), and had
the largest cumulative proportion of donors returning. Deferrals of shorter
duration had better return. Longer-term deferrals (up to 1 year in length) had
the lowest cumulative return proportion, which did not exceed 50%. Return was
associated with previously identified factors such as repeat donor status, older 
age, and higher educational attainment regardless of the type of deferral. In
addition, return was associated with having been born in the United States and
donation at fixed sites.
CONCLUSION: The category of temporary deferral influences the likelihood of
future return, but the demographic and donation factors associated with return
are largely consistent regardless of the deferral.

Although urban agriculture (UA) in the developing world may enhance nutrition and
local economies, it may also lead to higher densities of mosquito breeding sites 
and, consequently, to increased transmission of malarial parasites. If targeted
interventions against malaria vectors are to be successful in urban areas, the
habitats that support Anopheles breeding need to be identified and detected.
Mosquito breeding sites have recently been characterised, and the factors
associated with productive Anopheles habitats identified, in market gardens of
Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire. Two surveys were conducted in seven vegetable-production 
areas, one towards the end of the rainy season and one during the dry season. A
standardized methodology was used for habitat characterisation and the detection 
of Anopheles larvae and mosquito pupae. Overall, 454 and 559 potential
mosquito-breeding sites were recorded in the rainy-season and dry-season surveys,
respectively. In the rainy season, Anopheles larvae and mosquito pupae were found
in 29.7% and 5.5% of the potential breeding sites, respectively, whereas the
corresponding percentages in the dry season were 24.3% and 8.6%. The potential
breeding sites in an agricultural zone on the periphery of Abidjan were those
least likely to be positive for Anopheles larvae and mosquito pupae whereas
'agricultural trenches' between seedbeds were the sites most likely to be
positive. In a spatially-explicit Bayesian multivariate logistic-regression
model, although one out of every five such wells was also found to harbour
Anopheles larvae, irrigation wells were found to be the least productive
habitats, of those sampled, for pupae. In the study area, simple and
cost-effective strategies of larval control should be targeted at agricultural
trenches, ideally with the active involvement of local stakeholders (i.e. urban
farmers and urban agricultural extension services).

Since the etiologies and clinical outcomes of bacteremia in children with
Plasmodium falciparum infections, particularly in areas of holoendemic malaria
transmission, are largely unexplored, blood cultures and comprehensive clinical, 
laboratory, hematological, and nutritional parameters for malaria-infected
children (aged 1 to 36 months, n = 585 patients) were investigated at a rural
hospital in western Kenya. After the exclusion of contaminant microorganisms, the
prevalence of bacteremia was 11.7% in the cohort (n = 506), with nontyphoidal
Salmonella spp. being the most common isolates (42.4%). Bacteremia was found to
occur in a significantly higher proportion of females than males and was
associated with elevated blood glucose concentrations and lowered malaria
parasite and hemoglobin (Hb) levels compared to those in abacteremic
participants. In addition, the incidences of respiratory distress and severe
malarial anemia (SMA; Hb level of <6.0 g/dl) were nonsignificantly greater in
children with bacteremia. Mortality was 8.5-fold higher in children with
bacteremia. Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that bacteremia
was significantly associated with reduced incidences of high-density parasitemia 
(HDP; ≥ 10,000/μl) and increased incidences of malnutrition (i.e., underweight;
weight-for-age Z score of <-2 using the NCHS system). Since previous studies
showed that bacteremia caused by Gram-negative organisms is associated with
enhanced anemia and mortality, multivariate logistic regression was also
performed separately for randomly age- and gender-matched children with
bacteremia caused by Gram-negative organisms (n = 37) and for children found to
be abacteremic (n = 74). These results revealed that the presence of bacteremia
caused by Gram-negative organisms was significantly associated with reduced HDP, 
enhanced susceptibility to respiratory distress, SMA (Hb level of <6.0 g/dl), and
being underweight (Z score, <-2). Data presented here from a region of
holoendemic P. falciparum transmission demonstrate that although bacteremia is
associated with reduced malaria parasitemia, a number of unfavorable clinical
outcomes, including malnutrition, respiratory distress, anemia, and mortality,
are elevated in children with bacteremia, particularly in cases of Gram-negative 
origin.

From fever to anti-malarial: the treatment-seeking process in rural Senegal.

BACKGROUND: Currently less than 15% of children under five with fever receive
recommended artemisinin-combination therapy (ACT), far short of the Roll Back
Malaria target of 80%. To understand why coverage remains low, it is necessary to
examine the treatment pathway from a child getting fever to receiving appropriate
treatment and to identify critical blockages. This paper presents the application
of such a diagnostic approach to the coverage of prompt and effective treatment
of children with fever in rural Senegal.
METHODS: A two-stage cluster sample household survey was conducted in August 2008
in Tambacounda, Senegal, to investigate treatment behaviour for children under
five with fever in the previous two weeks. The treatment pathway was divided in
to five key steps; the proportion of all febrile children reaching each step was 
calculated. Results were stratified by sector of provider (public, community, and
retail). Logistic regression was used to determine predictors of treatment
seeking.
RESULTS: Overall 61.6% (188) of caretakers sought any advice or treatment and
40.3% (123) sought any treatment promptly within 48 hours. Over 70% of children
taken to any provider with fever did not receive an anti-malarial. The proportion
of febrile children receiving ACT within 48 hours was 6.2% (19) from any source; 
inclusion of correct dose and duration reduced this to 1.3%. The proportion of
febrile children receiving ACT within 48 hours (not including dose & duration)
was 3.0% (9) from a public provider, 3.0% (9) from a community source and 0.3%
(1) from the retail sector. Inclusion of confirmed diagnosis within the public
sector treatment pathway as per national policy increases the proportion of
children receiving appropriate treatment with ACT in this sector from 9.4% (9/96)
to an estimated 20.0% (9/45).
CONCLUSIONS: Process analysis of the treatment pathway for febrile children must 
be stratified by sector of treatment-seeking. In Tambacounda, Senegal,
interventions are needed to increase prompt care-seeking for fever, improve
uptake of rapid diagnostic tests at the public and community levels and increase 
correct treatment of parasite-positive patients with ACT. Limited impact will be 
achieved if interventions to improve prompt and effective treatment target only
one step in the treatment pathway in any sector.

INTRODUCTION: Malaria is endemic in the Brazilian Amazon region, with different
risks for each region. The City of Cantá, State of Roraima, presented one of the 
largest annual parasite indices in Brazil for the entire study period, with a
value always greater than 50. The present study aimed to use an artificial neural
network to predict the incidence of malaria in this city in order to assist
health coordinators in planning and managing resources.
METHODS: Data were collected on the website of the Ministry of Health,
SIVEP--Malaria between 2003 and 2009. An artificial neural network was structured
with three neurons in the input layer, two intermediate layers and an output
layer with one neuron. A sigmoid activation function was used. In training, the
backpropagation method was used, with a learning rate of 0.05 and momentum of
0.01. The stopping criterion was to reach 20,000 cycles or a target of 0.001. The
data from 2003 to 2008 were used for training and validation. The results were
compared with those from a logistic regression model.
RESULTS: The results for all periods provided showed that the artificial neural
network had a smaller mean square error and absolute error compared with the
regression model for the year 2009.
CONCLUSIONS: The artificial neural network proved to be adequate for a malaria
forecasting system in the city studied, determining smaller predictive values
with absolute errors compared to the logistic regression model and the actual
values.

Barriers to insecticide-treated mosquito net possession 2 years after a mass free
distribution campaign in Luangwa District, Zambia.

America.

BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Roll Back Malaria set the goal of 100% of households in
malaria endemic countries in Africa owning an insecticide-treated mosquito net
(ITN) by 2010. Zambia has used mass free distribution campaigns and distribution 
through antenatal care (ANC) clinics to achieve high coverage.
METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We conducted a probability survey of 801
households in 2008 to assess factors associated with households that lacked an
ITN after mass distribution. Community perceptions of barriers to ITN access were
also obtained from in-depth interviews with household heads that reported not
owning an ITN. Nearly 74% of households in Luangwa district reported owning ≥1
ITN. Logistic regression showed households without a child <5 years old during
the ITN distribution campaigns were twice as likely to not have an ITN as those
with a child <5 during distribution (Adjusted odds ratio (AOR)  = 2.43; 95%
confidence interval (CI): 1.67-3.55). Households without a woman who attended an 
ANC in the past 2 years were more likely to be without ITNs compared to
households with a woman who attended an ANC in the past 2 years (AOR  = 1.52; 95%
CI: 1.04-2.21). In-depth interviews with heads of households without an ITN
revealed that old age was a perceived barrier to receiving an ITN during
distribution, and that ITNs wore out before they could be replaced.
CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: Delivery of a large number of ITNs does not
translate directly into 100% household coverage. Due to their design, current ITN
distribution strategies may miss households occupied by the elderly and those
without children or ANC access. ITN distribution strategies targeting the
elderly, those with limited access to distribution points, and others most likely
to be missed are necessary if 100% ITN coverage of households is to be achieved.

Health seeking behaviour and utilization of health facilities for
schistosomiasis-related symptoms in ghana.

BACKGROUND: Schistosomiasis causes long-term illness and significant economic
burden. Morbidity control through integration within existing health care
delivery systems is considered a potentially sustainable and cost-effective
approach, but there is paucity of information about health-seeking behaviour.
METHODS: A questionnaire-based study involving 2,002 subjects was conducted in
three regions of Ghana to investigate health-seeking behaviour and utilization of
health facilities for symptoms related to urinary (blood in urine and painful
urination) and intestinal schistosomiasis (diarrhea, blood in stool, swollen
abdomen and abdominal pain). Fever (for malaria) was included for comparison.
RESULTS: Only 40% of patients with urinary symptoms sought care compared to >70% 
with intestinal symptoms and >90% with fever. Overall, about 20% of
schistosomiasis-related symptoms were reported to a health facility (hospital or 
clinic), compared to about 30% for fever. Allopathic self-medication was commonly
practiced as alternative action. Health-care seeking was relatively lower for
patients with chronic symptoms, but if they took action, they were more likely to
visit a health facility. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis,
perceived severity was the main predictor for seeking health care or visiting a
health facility. Age, socio-economic status, somebody else paying for health
care, and time for hospital visit occasionally showed a significant impact, but
no clear trend. The effect of geographic location was less marked, although
people in the central region, and to a lesser extent the north, were usually less
inclined to seek health care than people in the south. Perceived quality of
health facility did not demonstrate impact.
CONCLUSION: Perceived severity of the disease is the most important determinant
of seeking health care or visiting a health facility in Ghana. Schistosomiasis
control by passive case-finding within the regular health care delivery looks
promising, but the number not visiting a health facility is large and calls for
supplementary control options.

Determinants of delay in malaria treatment-seeking behaviour for under-five
children in south-west Ethiopia: a case control study.

Getahun A(1), Deribe K, Deribew A.

Author information: 
(1)Wollega University, Nakamte, Ethiopia.

BACKGROUND: Prompt diagnosis and timely treatment of malaria within 24 hours
after onset of first symptoms can reduce illness progression to severe stages and
therefore, decrease mortality. The reason why mothers/caretakers delay in malaria
diagnosis and treatment for under-five children is not well studied in Ethiopia. 
The objective of this study was to assess determinants of malaria treatment delay
in under-five children in three districts of south-west Ethiopia.
METHODS: A case control study was conducted from March 15 to April 20, 2010.
Cases were under-five children who had clinical malaria and sought treatment
after 24 hours of developing sign and symptom, and controls were under-five
children who had clinical malaria and sought treatment within 24 hours of
developing sign and symptom of malaria. Data were collected by trained
enumerators using structured questionnaire. Data were entered in to Epi Info
version 6.04 and analyzed using SPSS version 16.0. To identify determinants,
multiple logistic regression was done.
RESULTS: A total of 155 mothers of cases and 155 mothers of controls were
interviewed. Mothers of children who were in a monogamous marriage (OR = 3.41,
95% CI: 1.39, 8.34), who complained about the side effects of anti-malarial drugs
(OR = 4.96, 95% CI: 1.21, 20.36), who had no history of child death (OR = 3.50,
95% CI: 1.82, 6.42) and who complained about the higher cost of transportation to
reach the health institutions (OR = 2.01, 95% CI: 1.17, 3.45) were more likely to
be late for the treatment of malaria in under-five children.
CONCLUSION: Effective malaria control programmes should address reducing delayed 
presentation of children for treatment. Efforts to reduce delay should address
transport cost, decentralization of services and increasing awareness of the
community on early diagnosis and treatment.

Trends in malaria morbidity among health care-seeking children under age five in 
Mopti and Sévaré, Mali between 1998 and 2006.

BACKGROUND: In Mali, malaria is the leading cause of death and the primary cause 
of outpatient visits for children under five. The twin towns of Mopti and Sévaré 
have historically had high under-five mortality. This paper investigates the
changing malaria burden in children under five in these two towns for the years
1998-2006, and the likely contribution of previous interventions aimed at
reducing malaria.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of daily outpatient consultation records from
urban community health centres (CSCOMs) located in Mopti and Sévaré for the years
1998-2006 was conducted. Risk factors for a diagnosis of presumptive malaria,
using logistic regression and trends in presumptive malaria diagnostic rates,
were assessed using multilevel analysis.
RESULTS: Between 1998-2006, presumptive malaria accounted for 33.8% of all
recorded consultation diagnoses (10,123 out of 29,915). The monthly presumptive
malaria diagnostic rate for children under five decreased by 66% (average of 8
diagnoses per month per 1,000 children in 1998 to 2.7 diagnoses per month in
2006). The multi-level analysis related 37% of this decrease to the distribution 
of bed net treatment kits initiated in May of 2001. Children of the Fulani
(Peuhl) ethnicity had significantly lower odds of a presumptive malaria diagnosis
when compared to children of other ethnic groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Presumptive malaria diagnostic rates have decreased between
1998-2006 among health care-seeking children under five in Mopti and Sévaré. A
bed net treatment kit intervention conducted in 2001 is likely to have
contributed to this decline. The results corroborate previous findings that
suggest that the Fulani ethnicity is protective against malaria. The findings are
useful to encourage dialogue around the urban malaria situation in Mali,
particularly in the context of achieving the target of reducing malaria morbidity
in children younger than five by 50% by 2011 as compared to levels in 2000.

Identifying malaria vector breeding habitats with remote sensing data and
terrain-based landscape indices in Zambia.

BACKGROUND: Malaria, caused by the parasite Plasmodium falciparum, is a
significant source of morbidity and mortality in southern Zambia. In the Mapanza 
Chiefdom, where transmission is seasonal, Anopheles arabiensis is the dominant
malaria vector. The ability to predict larval habitats can help focus control
measures.
METHODS: A survey was conducted in March-April 2007, at the end of the rainy
season, to identify and map locations of water pooling and the occurrence
anopheline larval habitats; this was repeated in October 2007 at the end of the
dry season and in March-April 2008 during the next rainy season. Logistic
regression and generalized linear mixed modeling were applied to assess the
predictive value of terrain-based landscape indices along with LandSat imagery to
identify aquatic habitats and, especially, those with anopheline mosquito larvae.
RESULTS: Approximately two hundred aquatic habitat sites were identified with 69 
percent positive for anopheline mosquitoes. Nine species of anopheline mosquitoes
were identified, of which, 19% were An. arabiensis. Terrain-based landscape
indices combined with LandSat predicted sites with water, sites with anopheline
mosquitoes and sites specifically with An. arabiensis. These models were
especially successful at ruling out potential locations, but had limited ability 
in predicting which anopheline species inhabited aquatic sites. Terrain indices
derived from 90 meter Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation
data (DEM) were better at predicting water drainage patterns and characterizing
the landscape than those derived from 30 m Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission
and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) DEM.
CONCLUSIONS: The low number of aquatic habitats available and the ability to
locate the limited number of aquatic habitat locations for surveillance,
especially those containing anopheline larvae, suggest that larval control maybe 
a cost-effective control measure in the fight against malaria in Zambia and other
regions with seasonal transmission. This work shows that, in areas of seasonal
malaria transmission, incorporating terrain-based landscape models to the
planning stages of vector control allows for the exclusion of significant
portions of landscape that would be unsuitable for water to accumulate and for
mosquito larvae occupation. With increasing free availability of satellite
imagery such as SRTM and LandSat, the development of satellite imagery-based
prediction models is becoming more accessible to vector management coordinators.

Aflatoxins are fungal metabolites that contaminate staple food crops in many
developing countries. Up to 40% of women attending a prenatal clinic in Africa
may be anemic. In a cross-sectional study of 755 pregnant women, Aflatoxin
B(1)-lysine adducts (AF-ALB) levels were determined by high-performance liquid
chromatography. Participants were divided into quartiles "low," "moderate,"
"high," and "very high." Anemia was defined as hemoglobin levels < 11 g/dL.
Logistic regression was used to examine the association of anemia with AF-ALB.
The mean AF-ALB level was 10.9 pg/mg (range = 0.44-268.73 pg/mg); 30.3% of
participants were anemic. The odds of being anemic increased 21% (odds ratio
[OR], 1.21, P = 0.01) with each quartile of AF-ALB reaching an 85% increased odds
in the "very high" compared with the "low" category (OR, 1.85; confidence
interval [CI], 1.16-2.95). This association was stronger among women with malaria
and findings were robust when women with evidence of iron deficiency anemia were 
excluded. This study found a strong, consistent association between anemia in
pregnancy and aflatoxins.

Fine specificity of anti-MSP119 antibodies and multiplicity of Plasmodium
falciparum merozoite surface protein 1 types in individuals in Nigeria with
sub-microscopic infection.

BACKGROUND: The absence of antibodies specific for the 19 kDa C-terminal domain
of merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP119) has been associated with high-density
malaria parasitaemia in African populations. The hypothesis that a high
prevalence and/or level of anti-MSP119 antibodies that may inhibit erythrocyte
invasion would be present in apparently healthy individuals who harbour a
sub-microscopic malaria infection was tested in this study.
METHODS: Plasma samples were collected from residents in a region in Nigeria
hyperendemic for malaria, who had no detectable parasitaemia by microscopy. Using
a competition-based enzyme-linked-immunosorbent assay with two
invasion-inhibitory monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 12.10 and 12.8, the levels and
prevalence of specific antibodies were measured. The minimum multiplicity of
infection was determined using PCR. The prevalence of anaemia was also measured.
RESULTS: Plasma samples from 85% of individuals contained antibodies that bound
to MSP119. The inhibition of mAb 12.10 binding was strongly correlated with the
prevalence (Spearman correlation test, p < 0.0001) and mean titre of anti-MSP119 
antibodies (Spearman correlation test, p < 0.001) in the samples. Comparing
samples from individuals with multiple infection (group M) and single infection
(Group S), group M contained a higher (p = 0.04) prevalence of anti-MSP119
antibodies that competed with mAb 12.10. Using a logistic regression model, it
was found that the presence of antibodies competitive with mAb 12.10 was affected
negatively by anaemia (p = 0.0016) and positively by the carriage of multiple
parasite genotypes (p = 0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: In the search for correlates of protection against malaria, which
will be essential to evaluate clinical trials of malaria vaccines based on MSP1, 
this study examines some potential assays and the factors that need to taken into
account during their evaluation, using samples from individuals naturally exposed
to malaria infection.

Background malaria-control programs are increasingly dependent on accurate risk
maps to effectively guide the allocation of interventions and resources. Advances
in model-based geostatistics and geographical information systems (GIS) have
enabled researchers to better understand factors affecting malaria transmission
and thus, more accurately determine the limits of malaria transmission globally
and nationally. Here, we construct Plasmodium falciparum risk maps for Bangladesh
for 2007 at a scale enabling the malaria-control bodies to more accurately define
the needs of the program. A comprehensive malaria-prevalence survey (N = 9,750
individuals; N = 354 communities) was carried out in 2007 across the regions of
Bangladesh known to be endemic for malaria. Data were corrected to a standard age
range of 2 to less than 10 years. Bayesian geostatistical logistic regression
models with environmental covariates were used to predict P. falciparum
prevalence for 2- to 10-year-old children (PfPR(2-10)) across the endemic areas
of Bangladesh. The predictions were combined with gridded population data to
estimate the number of individuals living in different endemicity classes. Across
the endemic areas, the average PfPR(2-10) was 3.8%. Environmental variables
selected for prediction were vegetation cover, minimum temperature, and
elevation. Model validation statistics revealed that the final Bayesian
geostatistical model had good predictive ability. Risk maps generated from the
model showed a heterogeneous distribution of PfPR(2-10) ranging from 0.5% to 50%;
3.1 million people were estimated to be living in areas with a PfPR(2-10) greater
than 1%. Contemporary GIS and model-based geostatistics can be used to
interpolate malaria risk in Bangladesh. Importantly, malaria risk was found to be
highly varied across the endemic regions, necessitating the targeting of
resources to reduce the burden in these areas.

Plasmodium falciparum malaria and intestinal helminth infections are among the
most common infections in the tropics and they share the same spatial
distribution. The objective of this study was to explore the association between 
infections with intestinal helminths and P. falciparum infection as single
helminth infections or co-infections among school children. A cross-sectional
study was conducted among 400 school children in Nyamtongo, Sengerema District in
Tanzania. The study involved examination of single stool and finger prick blood
samples for intestinal helminths and malaria parasites. A Kato-Katz technique was
employed to screen for intestinal helminths and Giemsa stained thin and thick
blood smears were used to screen for malaria parasites. The results of logistic
regression model adjusted for age and sex indicated no association between P.
falciparum and S. mansoni (OR= 0.749, 95%CI 0.418-1.344), P. falciparum and
hookworm (OR= 0.885, 95%CI 0.489-1.605) and P. falciparum and co-infection of S. 
mansoni and hookworm (OR=0.859, 95%CI 0.422-1.745). Using multinomial regression 
model adjusted for age and sex, no association was observed between P. falciparum
with Schistosoma mansoni [Ratio of Relative Risk (RRR) = 0.651, 95% Confidence
Interval (CI) 0.331-1.363] and hookworm (RRR=0712, CI 0.280-1.765). Similarly, no
association was observed between co-infections of S. mansoni + hookworm
(RRR=0.635, CI 0.268-1.504) with P. falciparum infection. Coinfections of S.
mansoni, hookworm and P. falciparum among school children is common in the
Nyamatongo ward, Sengerema District. We recommend prospective longitudinal
studies to elucidate the interactions of malaria and helminths and its health
impact in risk groups.

Comment in
    Lancet Infect Dis. 2010 Oct;10(10):654-5.

BACKGROUND: Artemisinin-combination therapy (ACT) is recommended as first-line
treatment of falciparum malaria throughout the world, and fixed-dose combinations
are preferred by WHO; whether a single gametocytocidal dose of primaquine should 
be added is unknown. We aimed to compare effectiveness of four fixed-dose ACTs
and a loose tablet combination of artesunate and mefloquine, and assess the
addition of a single gametocytocidal dose of primaquine.
METHODS: In an open-label randomised trial in clinics in Rakhine state, Kachin
state, and Shan state in Myanmar (Burma) between Dec 30, 2008, and March 20,
2009, we compared the effectiveness of all four WHO-recommended fixed-dose ACTs
(artesunate-mefloquine, artesunate-amodiaquine, dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine,
artemether-lumefantrine) and loose artesunate-mefloquine in Burmese adults and
children. Eligible patients were those who presented to the clinics with acute
uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria or mixed infection, who were older
than 6 months, and who weighed more than 5 kg. Treatments were randomised in
equal numbers within blocks of 50 and allocation was in sealed envelopes. All
patients were also randomly assigned to receive either a single dose of
primaquine 0·75 mg base/kg or not. Patients were followed up for 63 days.
Treatment groups were compared by analysis of variance and multiple logistic
regression. The primary outcome was the 63 day recrudescence rate. This study is 
registered with clinicaltrials.gov, number NCT00902811.
FINDINGS: 155 patients received artesunate-amodiaquine, 162
artemether-lumefantrine, 169 artesunate-mefloquine, 161 loose
artesunate-mefloquine, and 161 dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. By day 63 of
follow-up, 14 patients (9·4%; 95% CI 5·7-15·3%) on artesunate-amodiaquine had
recrudescent P falciparum infections, a rate significantly higher than for
artemether-lumefantrine (two patients; 1·4%; 0·3-5·3; p=0·0013), fixed-dose
artesunate-mefloquine (0 patients; 0-2·3; p<0·0001), loose artesunate-mefloquine 
(two patients; 1·3%; 0·3-5·3; p=0·0018), and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (two 
patients 1·3%; 0·3-5·2%; p=0·0012). Hazard ratios for re-infection (95% CI) after
artesunate-amodiaquine were 3·2 (1·3-8·0) compared with the two
artesunate-mefloquine groups (p=0·01), 2·6 (1·0-6-0) compared with
artemether-lumefantrine (p=0·04), and 2·3 (0·9-6·0) compared with
dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (p=0·08). Mixed falciparum and vivax infections
were common: 129 (16%) had a mixed infection at presentation and 330 (41%)
patients had one or more episodes of Plasmodium vivax infection during follow-up.
The addition of a single dose of primaquine (0·75 mg/kg) reduced P falciparum
gametocyte carriage substantially: rate ratio 11·9 (95% CI 7·4-20·5). All
regimens were well tolerated. Adverse events were reported by 599 patients, most 
commonly vomiting and dizziness. Other side-effects were less common and were not
related to a specific treatment.
INTERPRETATION: Artesunate-amodiaquine should not be used in Myanmar, because the
other ACTs are substantially more effective. Artesunate-mefloquine provided the
greatest post-treatment suppression of malaria. Adding a single dose of
primaquine would substantially reduce transmission potential. Vivax malaria, not 
recurrent falciparum malaria, is the main complication after treatment of P
falciparum infections in this region.

[Change of protocol in the verbal autopsy method and measure of malaria mortality
in rural areas in Senegal].

In rural Senegal, three populations have been followed up since several decades
and the malaria mortality trend has been observed since the mid-1980s. However,
limits are associated with the verbal autopsy method used to determine causes of 
death, especially deaths due to malaria. A change in protocol occurred in recent 
years in two of these three sites with the involvement of two physicians (instead
of only one) in the diagnosis. The objective is here to measure its potential
impact on diagnosis of malaria deaths. Five hundred and fifteen diagnoses
reported on child deaths occurred from 2000 to 2005 have been analysed. We have
identified, on the basis of a multinomial logistic regression model, factors
affecting the determination of malaria deaths among the characteristics of the
child, the death, the illness and its symptoms, and we also took into account
method factors. Factors related to the method do not play on the malaria
diagnosis. This result insures the continuity of the series on malaria mortality 
statistics since 2000 in the two sites despite changes in the method. However,
the new protocol leads to vanish possibility of having deaths among ill-defined
or unknown causes. In the African context of absence of health statistics, data
obtained through the verbal autopsy method in demographic surveillance system can
provide accurate information in the epidemiological field, even regarding
malaria.

Anti-folate drug resistance in Africa: meta-analysis of reported dihydrofolate
reductase (dhfr) and dihydropteroate synthase (dhps) mutant genotype frequencies 
in African Plasmodium falciparum parasite populations.

BACKGROUND: Mutations in the dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) and dihydropteroate
synthase (dhps) genes of Plasmodium falciparum are associated with resistance to 
anti-folate drugs, most notably sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP). Molecular
studies document the prevalence of these mutations in parasite populations across
the African continent. However, there is no systematic review examining the
collective epidemiological significance of these studies. This meta-analysis
attempts to: 1) summarize genotype frequency data that are critical for molecular
surveillance of anti-folate resistance and 2) identify the specific challenges
facing the development of future molecular databases.
METHODS: This review consists of 220 studies published prior to 2009 that report 
the frequency of select dhfr and dhps mutations in 31 African countries. Maps
were created to summarize the location and prevalence of the highly resistant
dhfr triple mutant (N51I, C59R, S108N) genotype and dhps double mutant (A437G and
K540E) genotype in Africa. A hierarchical mixed effects logistic regression was
used to examine the influence of various factors on reported mutant genotype
frequency. These factors include: year and location of study, age and clinical
status of sampled population, and reporting conventions for mixed genotype data.
RESULTS: A database consisting of dhfr and dhps mutant genotype frequencies from 
all African studies that met selection criteria was created for this analysis.
The map illustrates particularly high prevalence of both the dhfr triple and dhps
double mutant genotypes along the Kenya-Tanzania border and Malawi. The
regression model shows a statistically significant increase in the prevalence of 
both the dhfr triple and dhps double mutant genotypes in Africa.
CONCLUSION: Increasing prevalence of the dhfr triple mutant and dhps double
mutant genotypes in Africa are consistent with the loss of efficacy of SP for
treatment of clinical malaria in most parts of this continent. Continued
assessment of the effectiveness of SP for the treatment of clinical malaria and
intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy is needed. The creation of a
centralized resistance data network, such as the one proposed by the WorldWide
Antimalarial Resistance Network (WWARN), will become a valuable resource for
planning timely actions to combat drug resistant malaria.

BACKGROUND: Whether Plasmodium falciparum, the agent of human malaria responsible
for over a million deaths per year, causes fitness costs in its mosquito vectors 
is a burning question that has not yet been adequately resolved. Understanding
the evolutionary forces responsible for the maintenance of susceptibility and
refractory alleles in natural mosquito populations is critical for understanding 
malaria transmission dynamics.
METHODS: In natural mosquito populations, Plasmodium fitness costs may only be
expressed in combination with other environmental stress factors hence this
hypothesis was tested experimentally. Wild-caught blood-fed Anopheles gambiae
s.s. females of the M and S molecular form from an area endemic for malaria in
Mali, West Africa, were brought to the laboratory and submitted to a 7-day period
of mild hydric stress or kept with water ad-libitum. At the end of this
experiment all females were submitted to intense desiccation until death. The
survival of all females throughout both stress episodes, as well as their body
size and infection status was recorded. The importance of stress, body size and
molecular form on infection prevalence and female survival was investigated using
Logistic Regression and Proportional-Hazard analysis.
RESULTS: Females subjected to mild stress exhibited patterns of survival and
prevalence of infection compatible with increased parasite-induced mortality
compared to non-stressed females. Fitness costs seemed to be linked to ookinetes 
and early oocyst development but not the presence of sporozoites. In addition,
when females were subjected to intense desiccation stress, those carrying oocysts
exhibited drastically reduced survival but those carrying sporozoites were
unaffected. No significant differences in prevalence of infection and
infection-induced mortality were found between the M and S molecular forms of
Anopheles gambiae.
CONCLUSIONS: Because these results suggest that infected mosquitoes may incur
fitness costs under natural-like conditions, they are particularly relevant to
vector control strategies aiming at boosting naturally occurring refractoriness
or spreading natural or foreign genes for refractoriness using genetic drive
systems in vector populations.

BACKGROUND: The diversity and abundance of Anopheles larvae has significant
influence on the resulting adult mosquito population and hence the dynamics of
malaria transmission. Studies were conducted to examine larval habitat dynamics
and ecological factors affecting survivorship of aquatic stages of malaria
vectors in three agro-ecological settings in Mwea, Kenya.
METHODS: Three villages were selected based on rice husbandry and water
management practices. Aquatic habitats in the 3 villages representing planned
rice cultivation (Mbui Njeru), unplanned rice cultivation (Kiamachiri) and
non-irrigated (Murinduko) agro-ecosystems were sampled every 2 weeks to generate 
stage-specific estimates of mosquito larval densities, relative abundance and
diversity. Records of distance to the nearest homestead, vegetation coverage,
surface debris, turbidity, habitat stability, habitat type, rice growth stage,
number of rice tillers and percent Azolla cover were taken for each habitat.
RESULTS: Captures of early, late instars and pupae accounted for 78.2%, 10.9% and
10.8% of the total Anopheles immatures sampled (n = 29,252), respectively. There 
were significant differences in larval abundance between 3 agro-ecosystems. The
village with 'planned' rice cultivation had relatively lower Anopheles larval
densities compared to the villages where 'unplanned' or non-irrigated. Similarly,
species composition and richness was higher in the two villages with either
'unplanned' or limited rice cultivation, an indication of the importance of land 
use patterns on diversity of larval habitat types. Rice fields and associated
canals were the most productive habitat types while water pools and puddles were 
important for short periods during the rainy season. Multiple logistic regression
analysis showed that presence of other invertebrates, percentage Azolla cover,
distance to nearest homestead, depth and water turbidity were the best predictors
for Anopheles mosquito larval abundance.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that agricultural practices have significant
influence on mosquito species diversity and abundance and that certain habitat
characteristics favor production of malaria vectors. These factors should be
considered when implementing larval control strategies which should be targeted
based on habitat productivity and water management.

BACKGROUND: In 2005, the Ministry of Health in Ethiopia launched a major effort
to distribute over 20 million long-lasting insecticidal nets, provide universal
access to artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACTs), and train 30,000
village-based health extension workers.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: A cross-sectional, nationally representative Malaria
Indicator Survey was conducted during the malaria transmission season in 2007.
Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the effect of 
women's malaria knowledge on household ITN ownership and women's ITN use. In
addition, we investigated the effect of mothers' malaria knowledge on their
children under 5 years of age's (U5) ITN use and their access to fever treatment 
on behalf of their child U5. Malaria knowledge was based on a composite index
about the causes, symptoms, danger signs and prevention of malaria. Approximately
67% of women (n=5,949) and mothers of children U5 (n=3,447) reported some
knowledge of malaria. Women's knowledge of malaria was significantly associated
with household ITN ownership (adjusted Odds Ratio [aOR]=2.1; 95% confidence
interval [CI] 1.6-2.7) and with increased ITN use for themselves (aOR=1.8; 95% CI
1.3-2.5). Knowledge of malaria amongst mothers of children U5 was associated with
ITN use for their children U5 (aOR=1.6; 95% CI 1.1-2.4), but not significantly
associated with their children U5 seeking care for a fever. School attendance was
a significant factor in women's ITN use (aOR=2.0; 95% CI 1.1-3.9), their children
U5's ITN use (aOR=4.4; 95% CI 1.6-12.1), and their children U5 having sought
treatment for a fever (aOR=6.5; 95% CI 1.9-22.9).
CONCLUSIONS: Along with mass free distribution of ITNs and universal access to
ACTs, delivery of targeted malaria educational information to women could improve
ITN ownership and use. Efforts to control malaria could be influenced by progress
towards broader goals of improving access to education, especially for women.

Saba, Israel. danny.alon@clalit.org.il

BACKGROUND: Elderly travel to the developing world is increasing. Little
information is available regarding risk behaviors and health during and after
travel in this population.
METHODS: We compared the risk factors and occurrence of travel-related diseases
in two populations of Israelis, travelers aged 60 years and older and travelers
in the age group of 20 to 30 years. Only people traveling for less than a month
were included. Pre-travel, each person received routine counseling regarding
travel-associated health risks, was immunized, and given anti-malarial
prescriptions as needed. Travelers were surveyed by telephone 6 to 12 months
following travel about underlying medical conditions, current medications, and
travel history. Risk and preventive behaviors, compliance with anti-malarial
prophylaxis, and history of illness during and after travel were assessed.
RESULTS: Of patients who visited the clinic from January to June 2008, 191/208
(91%) travelers aged 60 and older and 203/291 (69%) travelers aged 20 to 30 years
were contacted by phone and recruited. Fewer elderly travelers drank open drinks,
compared to young travelers (8% vs 35%, p < 0.01), and fewer purchased street
food compared to young travelers (16.2% vs 37.9%, p < 0.01). More elderly
travelers were fully compliant with their anti-malarial chemoprophylaxis regimen 
(60.7% vs 33.8%, p < 0.01). More elderly travelers took organized tours (61% vs
2%, p < 0.001). Young travelers more often backpacked (50.7% vs 10.4%, p <
0.001). Illness, most commonly diarrhea, was reported by 18.8% of elderly
travelers compared to 34.0% of the young travelers (p = 0.001). In a logistic
regression model only travel to East Asia (OR 4.66) (95%CI 1.93-11.22) and
traveling under basic conditions (OR 1.94) (95% CI 1.42-3.29) remained
significantly associated with illness, irrespective of age.
CONCLUSIONS: Because elderly travelers tend to comply with health-related
recommendations better and use less risky travel modes, their risk for illness
during travel was lower. Traveling to East Asia and travel mode are associated
with illness during travel, irrespective of age.

BACKGROUND: Muleba district in North-western Tanzania has experienced malaria
epidemics in recent years. Community knowledge, attitudes and practices are
important in enhancing disease control interventions. This study investigated
determinants of malaria epidemics in the study area in relation to household
knowledge, attitudes and practice on malaria.
METHODS: A community based cross-sectional survey involving 504 study
participants was conducted between April and June 2007 using a structured
questionnaire focusing on knowledge, attitudes and practices of community members
in epidemic and non-epidemic villages about malaria transmission, signs and
symptoms, treatment, prevention and control. Multivariate logistic regression
analysis was used to assess determinants of malaria epidemics.
RESULTS: A total of 504 respondents (males = 36.9%) were interviewed. Overall,
453 (90.1%) mentioned malaria as the most important disease in the area. Four
hundred and sixty four respondents (92.1%) knew that malaria is transmitted
through mosquito bite. A total of 436 (86.7%), 306 (60.8%) and 162 (32.1%)
mentioned fever, vomiting and loss of appetite as major symptoms/signs of
malaria, respectively. Of those interviewed 328 (65.1%) remembered the recent
outbreak of 2006. Of the 504 respondents interviewed, 296 (58.7%) reported that
their households owned at least one mosquito net. Three hundred and ninety seven 
respondents (78.8%) knew insecticides used to impregnate bed nets. About two
thirds (63.3%) of the respondents had at least a household member who suffered
from malaria during the recent epidemic. During the 2006 outbreak, 278 people
(87.2%) sought treatment from health facilities while 27 (8.5%) obtained drugs
from drug shops and 10 (3.1%) used local herbs. Logistic regression analysis
showed that household location and level of knowledge of cause of malaria were
significant predictors of a household being affected by epidemic.
CONCLUSIONS: Residents of Muleba district have high level of knowledge on
malaria. However, this knowledge has not been fully translated into appropriate
use of available malaria interventions. Our findings suggest that household
location, ineffective usage of insecticide treated nets and knowledge gaps on
malaria transmission, signs and symptoms, prevention and control predisposed
communities in the district to malaria epidemics. It is important that health
education packages are developed to address the identified knowledge gaps.

As an evolutionary response to prevent malaria infection, most Africans do not
express the Duffy Antigen/Receptor for Chemokines (DARC) on their red blood
cells. Results from experimental studies suggest that DARC expression inhibits
prostate-tumor growth. We tested the hypothesis that men of African descent who
lack DARC expression are at increased risk of prostate cancer. A case-control
study involving 81 age-matched pairs was conducted in Jamaica. Participants were 
interviewed to collect data, and they donated blood for determination of DARC
expression. Logistic regression was used to estimate associations with prostate
cancer and aggressive disease. Little or no association was observed between
erythrocyte DARC expression and prostate cancer or between DARC expression and
aggressive disease. These associations changed little when adjusting for other
potential confounders. Our results do not support an effect of erythrocyte DARC
expression on the risk or progression of prostate cancer in men of African
descent.

BACKGROUND: Malaria is endemic in 13 eastern districts where the overall
infection prevalence is 3.97%. In 2006, Bangladesh received US$ 36.9 million from
the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM) to support the
national malaria control programme of Bangladesh.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to i) clarify factors associated with
treatment seeking behaviours of malaria ii) distribution of LLIN, and iii)
re-treatment of ITN in remote area of a CHT district of Bangladesh two years
after implementation of national control programme.
METHODS: All households of Rajasthali sub-district of Rangamati district
(households about 5,322, population about 24,097), all BRAC health workers (n =
15), health facilities and drug vendors' locations were mapped. Distances from
households to health facilities, BRAC health workers and drug vendors were
calculated. Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the associations
between the choice of the treatment and the distance to various treatment
sources, education, occupation and ethnicity. SaTScan was used to detect
clustering of treatment-seeking approaches.
FINDINGS: LLIN distribution and the re-treatment of ITN exceeded target goals.
The most common treatment facility for malaria-associated fever was malaria
control programme led by BRAC and government (66.6%) followed by the drug vendor 
(48.8%).
CONCLUSION: Closeness to health facilities run by the malaria control programme
and drug vendors were significantly associated with the choice of treatment. A
high proportion of people preferred drug vendors without having a proper
diagnosis. Drug vendors are highly patronized and thus there is a need to improve
their services for public health good. Otherwise it may cause incomplete
treatment, misuse of anti-malarial drugs that will contribute to the risk of drug
resistance and jeopardize the present malaria control efforts in Bangladesh.

BACKGROUND: The Ministry of Health in the Republic of Vanuatu has implemented a
malaria elimination programme in Tafea Province, the most southern and eastern
limit of malaria transmission in the South West Pacific. Tafea Province is
comprised of five islands with malaria elimination achieved on one of these
islands (Aneityum) in 1998. The current study aimed to establish the baseline
distribution of malaria on the most malarious of the province's islands, Tanna
Island, to guide the implementation of elimination activities.
METHODS: A parasitological survey was conducted in Tafea Province in 2008. On
Tanna Island there were 4,716 participants from 220 villages, geo-referenced
using a global position system. Spatial autocorrelation in observed prevalence
values was assessed using a semivariogram. Backwards step-wise regression
analysis was conducted to determine the inclusion of environmental and climatic
variables into a prediction model. The Bayesian geostatistical logistic
regression model was used to predict malaria risk, and associated uncertainty
across the island.
RESULTS: Overall, prevalence on Tanna was 1.0% for Plasmodium falciparum
(accounting for 32% of infections) and 2.2% for Plasmodium vivax (accounting for 
68% of infections). Regression analysis showed significant association with
elevation and distance to coastline for P. vivax and P. falciparum, but no
significant association with NDVI or TIR. Colinearity was observed between
elevation and distance to coastline with the later variable included in the final
Bayesian geostatistical model for P. vivax and the former included in the final
model for P. falciparum. Model validation statistics revealed that the final
Bayesian geostatistical model had good predictive ability.
CONCLUSION: Malaria in Tanna Island, Vanuatu, has a focal and predominantly
coastal distribution. As Vanuatu refines its elimination strategy, malaria risk
maps represent an invaluable resource in the strategic planning of all levels of 
malaria interventions for the island.

The importance of drains for the larval development of lymphatic filariasis and
malaria vectors in Dar es Salaam, United Republic of Tanzania.

Boston, Massachusetts, USA. mcastro@hsph.harvard.edu

BACKGROUND: Dar es Salaam has an extensive drain network, mostly with inadequate 
water flow, blocked by waste, causing flooding after rainfall. The presence of
Anopheles and Culex larvae is common, which is likely to impact the transmission 
of lymphatic filariasis and malaria by the resulting adult mosquito populations. 
However, the importance of drains as larval habitats remains unknown.
METHODOLOGY: Data on mosquito larval habitats routinely collected by the Urban
Malaria Control Program (UMCP) and a special drain survey conducted in 2006 were 
used to obtain a typology of habitats. Focusing on drains, logistic regression
was used to evaluate potential factors impacting the presence of mosquito larvae.
Spatial variation in the proportion of habitats that contained larvae was
assessed through the local Moran's I indicator of spatial association.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: More than 70% of larval habitats in Dar es Salaam were
human-made. Aquatic habitats associated with agriculture had the highest
proportion of Anopheles larvae presence and the second highest of Culex larvae
presence. However, the majority of aquatic habitats were drains (42%), and
therefore, 43% (1,364/3,149) of all culicine and 33% (320/976) of all anopheline 
positive habitats were drains. Compared with drains where water was flowing at
normal velocity, the odds of finding Anopheles and Culex larvae were 8.8 and 6.3 
(p<0.001) times larger, respectively, in drains with stagnant water. There was a 
positive association between vegetation and the presence of mosquito larvae
(p<0.001). The proportion of habitats with mosquito larvae was spatially
correlated.
CONCLUSION: Restoring and maintaining drains in Dar es Salaam has the potential
to eliminate more than 40% of all potential mosquito larval habitats that are
currently treated with larvicides by the UMCP. The importance of human-made
larval habitats for both lymphatic filariasis and malaria vectors underscores the
need for a synergy between on-going control efforts of those diseases.

Estimating the distribution of causes of death among children age 1-59 months in 
high-mortality countries with incomplete death certification.

Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA. hjohnson@jhsph.edu

BACKGROUND: Our objective was to develop a methodology to estimate causes of
death among children age 1-59 months in high child mortality countries without
adequate vital registration (VR) systems.
METHODS: We systematically reviewed community-based studies reporting at least
two causes of death among children 1-59 months of age identified from published
and unpublished sources. We included (i) studies conducted after 1979, (ii) for
duration of 12 months or an exact multiple, (iii) with > or =25 deaths in
children <5 years, (iv) each death represented once and (v) <25% of deaths due to
unknown causes. A study-based multinomial logistic regression model was applied
to country-level data to estimate causes of child death.
RESULTS: Of the 216 studies reviewed, 81 were included in the analysis comprising
79 067 under-5 deaths from 25 countries. After adjusting for risk factors and
intervention coverage, the estimated distribution of causes of deaths in children
1-59 months of age in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia was: pneumonia (21
and 31%), diarrhoea (25 and 31%), malaria (26 and 2%), injury (3 and 4%),
meningitis (3 and 4%), measles (3 and 2%) and other causes (20 and 27%),
respectively.
CONCLUSION: From studies reporting as few as two different causes of death,
statistical modelling can be used to estimate the causes of child mortality for
settings with incomplete VR. Pneumonia and diarrhoea remain the leading causes of
death among children 1-59 months of age in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia.

Diseases, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.

BACKGROUND: Hyponatraemia (serum sodium < 135 mmol/L) has long been recognized as
a complication of malaria. However, few studies have been done in non-immune
adult populations. It has not been investigated previously how hyponatraemia is
distributed among the various Plasmodium species, and its association with
malaria severity is unknown.The aim of this retrospective cohort study was to
determine the prevalence of hyponatraemia and its association with malaria
severity in a large cohort of patients with imported malaria caused by various
Plasmodium species.
METHODS: All patients that were diagnosed with malaria in the Harbour Hospital
and Institute for Tropical Diseases in Rotterdam in the period 1999-2009 and who 
had available serum sodium on admission were included. Severe malaria was defined
according to the modified WHO criteria. Prevalence of hyponatraemia and its
association with malaria severity were investigated by univariate comparison, ROC
analysis and multivariate logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 446 patients with malaria (severe falciparum malaria n = 35, 
non-severe falciparum malaria n = 280, non-falciparum malaria n = 131) was
included. Hyponatraemia was present in 207 patients (46%). Prevalence and
severity of hyponatraemia were greatest in severe falciparum malaria (77%, median
serum sodium 129 mmol/L), followed by non-severe falciparum malaria (48%, median 
serum sodium 131 mmol/L), and non-falciparum malaria (34%, median serum sodium
132 mmol/L). Admission serum sodium < 133 mmol/L had a sensitivity of 0.69 and a 
specificity of 0.76 for predicting severe malaria. Multivariate logistic
regression showed that serum sodium < 131 mmol/L was independently associated
with severe falciparum malaria (odds ratio 10.4, 95% confidence interval
3.1-34.9). In patients with hyponatraemia, hypovolaemia did not appear to play a 
significant role in the development of hyponatraemia when prerenal azotaemia and 
haematocrit were considered as surrogate markers for hypovolaemia.
CONCLUSIONS: Hyponatraemia is common in imported malaria and is associated with
severe falciparum malaria. From a clinical point of view, the predictive power of
hyponatraemia for severe malaria is limited. The precise pathophysiological
mechanisms of hyponatraemia in malaria require further study.

BACKGROUND: More than 300,000 children are newly infected with HIV each year,
predominantly through mother-to-child transmission (HIV MTCT). Identification of 
host genetic traits associated with transmission may more clearly explain the
mechanisms of HIV MTCT and further the development of a vaccine to protect
infants from infection. Associations between transmission and a selection of
genes or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)s may give an incomplete picture of
HIV MTCT etiology. Thus, this study employed a genome-wide association approach
to identify novel variants associated with HIV MTCT.
METHODS: We conducted a nested case-control study of HIV MTCT using infants of
HIV(+) mothers, drawn from a cohort study of malaria and HIV in pregnancy in
Blantyre, Malawi. Whole genome scans (650,000 SNPs genotyped using Illumina
genotyping assays) were obtained for each infant. Logistic regression was used to
evaluate the association between each SNP and HIV MTCT.
RESULTS: Genotype results were available for 100 HIV(+) infants (at birth, 6, or 
12 weeks) and 126 HIV(-) infants (at birth, 6, and 12 weeks). We identified 9
SNPs within 6 genes with a P-value < 5 × 10(-5) associated with the risk of
transmission, in either unadjusted or adjusted by maternal HIV viral load
analyses. Carriers of the rs8069770 variant allele were associated with a lower
risk of HIV MTCT (odds ratio = 0.27, 95% confidence interval = 0.14, 0.51), where
rs8069770 is located within HS3ST3A1, a gene involved in heparan sulfate
biosynthesis. Interesting associations for SNPs located within or near genes
involved in pregnancy and development, innate immunological response, or HIV
protein interactions were also observed.
CONCLUSIONS: This study used a genome-wide approach to identify novel variants
associated with the risk of HIV MTCT in order to gain new insights into HIV MTCT 
etiology. Replication of this work using a larger sample size will help us to
differentiate true positive findings.

BACKGROUND: Atopic eczema is an increasing clinical problem in Africa.
OBJECTIVE: To determine allergic characteristics and to identify possible risk
factors for eczema among schoolchildren in an urbanized area in Ghana.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Schoolchildren aged 3-16 years with eczema were recruited. 
For each patient, one to three age- and sex-matched controls were selected. All
children completed a questionnaire and were skin prick tested with a panel of
allergens. Blood was drawn to determine the total and allergen-specific IgE.
Conditional logistic regression models with the matching factors included in the 
model were used to calculate the odds ratios and to adjust for possible
confounders.
RESULTS: A total of 52 children with eczema (27 boys and 25 girls) and 99
controls were included. Levels of total IgE were found to be 9.1 (1.1; 78.4)
times more often elevated in children with eczema. This association was mainly
driven by elevated IgE levels against cockroach antigen. Children with eczema
were found to have 2.0 (0.87; 4.7) times more often positive skin prick tests
(SPT), but this association diminished to 1.2 (0.40; 3.6) after adjustment for
total IgE levels. Frequent washing with soap was identified as a risk factor for 
the development of eczema among these children.
CONCLUSION: Schoolchildren with eczema in Ghana were characterized by elevated
IgE levels especially against cockroach antigen. The association between eczema
and positive SPT was much weaker suggesting immune hyporesponsiveness of the
skin. After adjustment for IgE level, SPT were less suitable to distinguish
children with and without eczema.

Author information: 
(1)Ministry of Health, BP 281, Buea, Cameroon. etakem@mrc.gm.

BACKGROUND: Anaemia is caused by many factors in developing countries including
malaria. We compared anaemia rates in patients with malaria parasitaemia to that 
of patients without malaria parasitaemia.
FINDINGS: A cross-sectional study was carried out from November 2007 to July 2008
in health units in Buea, Cameroon. Adult patients with fever or history of fever 
were included in the study. Information on socio-demographic variables and other 
variables was collected using a questionnaire. Malaria parasitaemia status was
determined by microscopy using Giemsa stained thick blood smears. Haemoglobin
levels were determined by the microhaematocrit technique.The study population
consisted of 250 adult patients with a mean age of 29.31 years (SD = 10.63) and
59.44% were females. 25.60% of the patients had malaria parasitaemia while 14.80%
had anaemia (haemoglobin < 11 g/dl). Logistic regression revealed that those with
malaria parasitaemia had more anaemia compared to those without malaria
parasitaemia(OR = 4.33, 95%CI = 1.21-15.43, p = 0.02) after adjusting for age,
sex, rural residence, socioeconomic status, use of antimalarials, use of
insecticide treated nets(ITN) and white blood cell count.
CONCLUSIONS: In adult patients with fever in this setting, malaria parasitaemia
contributes to anaemia and is of public health impact. Our results also provide a
baseline prevalence for malaria parasitaemia in febrile adults in health units in
this setting.

INTRODUCTION: Malaria remains a major health concern in tropical and subtropical 
countries. A large number of cases of malaria have been reported from the State
of Orissa, India. Severe malaria cases are reported throughout the year, but they
are more common during the high transmission season. The last decade has
witnessed a changing pattern of presentations and complications across the
country. Severe falciparum malaria is an important cause of multiple organ
failure in Indian intensive care unit (ICU) patients.
METHODS: All patients with severe falciparum malaria above the age of 14 years
admitted to the ICU were included in this study. The clinical spectrum of severe 
falciparum malaria in a tertiary care level III ICU was analysed from December
1998 to June 2008. In all, there were 301 patients with severe malaria admitted
to the ICU during that period.
RESULTS: Most patients (66.9 percent) had a history of fever for less than seven 
days. The age distribution of the patients was 38.24 +/- 14.24 years. The
Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score at admission to the ICU was 10.44 +/-
4.26. The median duration of ICU stay was three days (range 0-15 days) and 42
percent of the patients required ventilator support. Approximately 48 percent and
42 percent of patients required blood component transfusion and renal replacement
therapy, respectively. The rate of single organ involvement was relatively low
and multi-organ dysfunction was very common. Jaundice with acute renal failure
(ARF) was the most common presentation (13.28 percent), followed by cerebral
malaria with jaundice and ARF (6.37 percent), and jaundice, ARF and acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (5.31 percent). The overall mortality rate
was 35.4 percent. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to
estimate the association of the complications with mortality. Shock, ARF, seizure
and ARDS were associated with higher mortality.
CONCLUSION: Severe falciparum malaria is a common cause of multi-organ failure in
the ICUs in eastern India. There has been no change in the pattern of
presentations over the last ten years in the east Indian state of Orissa. Apart
from early diagnosis and treatment, good supportive care is the mainstay for
better outcome in these cases.

Severe malarial anaemia (SMA) is a common complication of Plasmodium falciparum
infections, resulting in mortality rates that may exceed 30% in paediatric
populations residing in holoendemic transmission areas. One strategy for reducing
the morbidity and mortality associated with SMA is to identify clinical
predictors that can be readily recognized by caregivers for prompt therapeutic
interventions. To determine clinical predictors of SMA, Kenyan children (3-36
months, n = 671) presenting with acute illness at a rural hospital in Siaya
District were recruited. Demographic, clinical, laboratory and haematological
parameters were measured upon enrolment. As human immunodeficiency virus-1 and
bacteraemia promote reduced haemoglobin (Hb) concentrations, children with these 
infections were excluded from the analyses. Children with P. falciparum
mono-infections (n = 355) were stratified into three groups: uncomplicated
malaria (Hb >or= 110 g/l); non-SMA (60 <or= Hb < 109), and SMA (Hb < 60 g/l). SMA
was characterized by a younger age, monocytosis, thrombocytopenia,
reticulocytosis, reduced erythropoiesis, elevated pigment-containing monocytes
(PCM), respiratory distress, conjunctival and palmar pallor, splenomegaly, signs 
of malnutrition, and protracted fever and emesis. Logistic regression analysis
demonstrated that age, reticulocyte count, presence of PCM and conjunctival and
palmar pallor were significant predictors of SMA. Recognition of these clinical
signs in children residing in resource-poor settings may help to guide the
identification and management of SMA.

BACKGROUND: Plasmodium berghei ANKA infection in C57Bl/6 mice induces cerebral
malaria (CM), which reproduces, to a large extent, the pathological features of
human CM. However, experimental CM incidence is variable (50-100%) and the period
of incidence may present a range as wide as 6-12 days post-infection. The poor
predictability of which and when infected mice will develop CM can make it
difficult to determine the causal relationship of early pathological changes and 
outcome. With the purpose of contributing to solving these problems, algorithms
for CM prediction were built.
METHODS: Seventy-eight P. berghei-infected mice were daily evaluated using the
primary SHIRPA protocol. Mice were classified as CM+ or CM- according to
development of neurological signs on days 6-12 post-infection. Logistic
regression was used to build predictive models for CM based on the results of
SHIRPA tests and parasitaemia.
RESULTS: The overall CM incidence was 54% occurring on days 6-10. Some algorithms
had a very good performance in predicting CM, with the area under the receiver
operator characteristic ((au)ROC) curve > or = 80% and positive predictive values
(PV+) > or = 95, and correctly predicted time of death due to CM between 24 and
72 hours before development of the neurological syndrome ((au)ROC = 77-93%; PV+ =
100% using high cut off values). Inclusion of parasitaemia data slightly improved
algorithm performance.
CONCLUSION: These algorithms work with data from a simple, inexpensive,
reproducible and fast protocol. Most importantly, they can predict CM development
very early, estimate time of death, and might be a valuable tool for research
using CM murine models.

BACKGROUND: The world is facing an increased threat from new and emerging
diseases, and there is concern that climate change will expand areas suitable for
transmission of vector borne diseases. The likelihood of vivax malaria returning 
to the UK was explored using two markedly different modelling approaches. First, 
a simple temperature-dependent, process-based model of malaria growth transmitted
by Anopheles atroparvus, the historical vector of malaria in the UK. Second, a
statistical model using logistic-regression was used to predict historical
malaria incidence between 1917 and 1918 in the UK, based on environmental and
demographic data. Using findings from these models and saltmarsh distributions,
future risk maps for malaria in the UK were produced based on UKCIP02 climate
change scenarios.
RESULTS: The process-based model of climate suitability showed good
correspondence with historical records of malaria cases. An analysis of the
statistical models showed that mean temperature of the warmest month of the year 
was the major factor explaining the distribution of malaria, further supporting
the use of the temperature-driven processed-based model. The risk maps indicate
that large areas of central and southern England could support malaria
transmission today and could increase in extent in the future. Confidence in
these predictions is increased by the concordance between the processed-based and
statistical models.
CONCLUSION: Although the future climate in the UK is favourable for the
transmission of vivax malaria, the future risk of locally transmitted malaria is 
considered low because of low vector biting rates and the low probability of
vectors feeding on a malaria-infected person.

This study was designed to investigate the factors associated with the high rate 
of false-positive test results observed with the 4th-generation Murex HIV Ag/Ab
Combination EIA (enzyme immunoassay) within an adolescent and young-adult cohort 
in northwest Tanzania. (4th-generation assays by definition detect both HIV
antigen and antibody.) The clinical and sociodemographic factors associated with 
false-positive HIV results were analyzed for 6,940 Tanzanian adolescents and
young adults. A subsample of 284 Murex assay-negative and 240 false-positive
serum samples were analyzed for immunological factors, including IgG antibodies
to malaria and schistosoma parasites, heterophile antibodies, and rheumatoid
factor (RF) titers. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds
ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). False-positive HIV test results 
were associated with evidence of other infections. False positivity was strongly 
associated with increasing levels of Schistosoma haematobium worm IgG1, with
adolescents with optical densities in the top quartile being at the highest risk 
(adjusted OR=40.7, 95% CI=8.5 to 194.2 compared with the risk for those in the
bottom quartile). False positivity was also significantly associated with
increasing S. mansoni egg IgG1 titers and RF titers of >or=80 (adjusted OR=8.2,
95% CI=2.8 to 24.3). There was a significant negative association between Murex
assay false positivity and the levels of S. mansoni worm IgG1 and IgG2 and
Plasmodium falciparum IgG1 and IgG4. In Africa, endemic infections may affect the
specificities of immunoassays for HIV infection. Caution should be used when the 
results of 4th-generation HIV test results are interpreted for African adolescent
populations.

The effect of concomitant infection with schistosomes, Plasmodium falciparum and 
soil transmitted helminths (STHs) on anaemia was determined in 609 Zimbabwean
primary school children. P. falciparum, haemoglobin levels and serum ferritin
were determined from venous blood. Kato Katz, formal ether concentration and
urine filtration techniques were used to assess prevalence of Schistosoma
mansoni, STHs and Schistosoma haematobium infections. The prevalence of S.
haematobium, S. mansoni, P. falciparum, hookworm, Trichuris trichiura and Ascaris
lumbricoides were 52.3%, 22.7%, 27.9%, 23.7%, 2.3% and 2.1%, respectively. The
overall prevalence of anaemia and iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) were 48.4%
(277/572) and 38.1% (181/475). Haemoglobin levels among children who had P.
falciparum, S. haematobium and hookworm were lower than negative individuals,
p<0.001, p<0.001 and p=0.030, respectively. The prevalence of anaemia and IDA in 
co-infections was almost double that in single infection. Children with P.
falciparum/STHs/schistosome and schistosomes/P. falciparum co-infections recorded
higher prevalence of anaemia and IDA (80.8% and 57.4%, respectively) than other
combinations, p<0.001. Logistic regression revealed that, age group > or = 14
years, P. falciparum, S. haematobium light and heavy infections, and S. mansoni
moderate and heavy infection, hookworm light infection were predictors of
anaemia. This study suggests that integrated school based de-worming and malaria 
control have the potential to reduce the burden of anaemia.

Duffy binding protein (DBP), a leading malaria vaccine candidate, plays a
critical role in Plasmodium vivax erythrocyte invasion. Sixty-eight of 366
(18.6%) subjects had IgG anti-DBP antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) in a community-based cross-sectional survey in the Brazilian Amazon
Basin. Despite continuous exposure to low-level malaria transmission, the overall
seroprevalence decreased to 9.0% when the population was reexamined 12 months
later. Antibodies from 16 of 50 (36.0%) subjects who were ELISA-positive at the
baseline were able to inhibit erythrocyte binding to at least one of two DBP
variants tested. Most (13 of 16) of these subjects still had inhibitory
antibodies when reevaluated 12 months later. Cumulative exposure to malaria was
the strongest predictor of DBP seropositivity identified by multiple logistic
regression models in this population. The poor antibody recognition of DBP
elicited by natural exposure to P. vivax in Amazonian populations represents a
challenge to be addressed by vaccine development strategies.

BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of malaria chemoprophylaxis is limited by the lack 
of compliance whose determinants are not well known.
METHODS: The compliance with malaria chemoprophylaxis has been estimated and
analysed by validated questionnaires administered before and after the short-term
missions (about four months) in five tropical African countries of 2,093 French
soldiers from 19 military companies involved in a prospective cohort study.
"Correct compliance" was defined as "no missed doses" of daily drug intake during
the entire mission and was analysed using multiple mixed-effect logistic
regression model.
RESULTS: The averaged prevalence rate of correct compliance was 46.2%, ranging
from 9.6%to 76.6% according to the companies. Incorrect compliance was
significantly associated with eveningness (p = 0.028), a medical history of
clinical malaria (p < 0.001) and a perceived mosquito attractiveness inferior or 
superior to the others (p < 0.007). Correct compliance was significantly
associated with the systematic use of protective measures against mosquito bites 
(p < 0.001), the type of military operations (combat vs. training activities, p <
0.001) and other individual factors (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The identification of circumstances and profiles of persons at
higher risk of lack of compliance would pave the way to specifically targeted
strategies aimed to improve compliance with malaria chemoprophylaxis and,
therefore, its effectiveness.

BACKGROUND: World Health Organization treatment guidelines recommend that adults 
with severe malaria be admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU). However, ICU
facilities are limited in the resource-poor settings where most malaria occurs.
Identification of patients at greater risk of complications may facilitate their 
triage and resource allocation.
METHODS: With use of data from a trial conducted in Southeast Asia (n=868), a
logistic regression model was built to identify independent predictors of
mortality among adults with severe malaria. A scoring system based on this model 
was tested in the original dataset and then validated in 2 series from Bangladesh
(n=188) and Vietnam (n=292).
RESULTS: Acidosis (base deficit) and cerebral malaria (measured as Glasgow Coma
Score) were the main independent predictors of outcome. The 5-point Coma Acidosis
Malaria (CAM) score was simply derived from these 2 variables. Mortality
increased steadily with increasing score. A CAM score <2 predicted survival with 
a positive predictive value (PPV) of 95.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 93%-
97.7%). Of the 14 of 331 patients who died with a CAM score <2, 11 (79%) had
renal failure and death occurred late after hospital admission (median, 108 h;
range, 40-360 h). Substitution of plasma bicarbonate as the measure of acidosis
only slightly reduced the prognostic value of the model. Use of respiratory rate 
was inferior, but a score <2 still predicted survival with a PPV of 92.2% (95%
CI, 89.1%-94.7%).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a CAM score <2 at hospital admission may be safely
treated in a general ward, provided that renal function can be monitored.

Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine with amodiaquine (SP-AQ) is a highly efficacious
regimen for intermittent preventive treatment to prevent malaria in children
(IPTc), but the amodiaquine component is not always well tolerated. We determined
the association between amodiaquine dosage by body weight and mild adverse events
(AEs) and investigated whether alternative age-based regimens could improve
dosing accuracy and tolerability, using data from two trials of IPTc in Senegal, 
one in which AQ dose was determined by age and the other in which it was
determined by weight category. Both dosage strategies resulted in some children
receiving AQ doses above the recommended therapeutic range. The odds of vomiting 
increased with increasing amodiaquine dosage. In one study, incidence of fever
also increased with increasing dosage. Anthropometric data from 1,956 children
were used to predict the dosing accuracy of existing and optimal alternative
regimens. Logistic regression models describing the probability of AEs by dosage 
were used to predict the potential reductions in mild AEs for each regimen.
Simple amendments to current AQ dosing schedules based on the child's age could
substantially increase dosing accuracy and thus improve the tolerability of IPTc 
using SP-amodiaquine in situations where weighing the child is impractical.

BACKGROUND: This paper studies the determinants of utilization of health care
services, especially for treatment of febrile illness in the malaria endemic area
of north-east India.
METHODS: An area served by two districts of Upper Assam representing people
living in malaria endemic area was selected for household survey. A sample of
1,989 households, in which at least one member of household suffered from febrile
illness during last three months and received treatment from health service
providers, were selected randomly and interviewed by using the structured
questionnaire. The individual characteristics of patients including social
indicators, area of residence and distance of health service centers has been
used to discriminate or group the patients with respect to their initial and
final choice of service providers.
RESULTS: Of 1,989 surveyed households, initial choice of treatment-seeking for
febrile illness was self-medication (17.8%), traditional healer (Vaidya)(39.2%), 
government (29.3%) and private (13.7%) health services. Multinomial logistic
regression (MLR) analysis exhibits the influence of occupation, area of residence
and ethnicity on choice of health service providers. The traditional system of
medicine was commonly used by the people living in remote areas compared with
towns. As all the febrile cases finally received treatment either from government
or private health service providers, the odds (Multivariate Rate Ratio) was
almost three-times higher in favour of government services for lower households
income people compared to private.
CONCLUSION: The study indicates the popular use of self-medication and
traditional system especially in remote areas, which may be the main cause of
delay in diagnosis of malaria. The malaria training given to the paramedical
staff to assist the health care delivery needs to be intensified and expanded in 
north-east India. The people who are economically poor and living in remote areas
mainly visit the government health service providers for seeking treatment. So,
the improvement of quality health services in government health sector and
provision of health education to people would increase the utilization of
government health services and thereby improve the health quality of the people.

BACKGROUND: Severe and cerebral malaria are associated with endothelial
activation. Angiopoietin-1 (ANG-1) and angiopoietin-2 (ANG-2) are major
regulators of endothelial activation and integrity. The aim of this study was to 
investigate the clinical utility of whole blood angiopoietin (ANG) levels as
biomarkers of disease severity in Plasmodium falciparum malaria.
METHODS: The utility of whole blood ANG levels was examined in Thai patients to
distinguish cerebral (CM; n = 87) and severe (non-cerebral) malaria (SM; n = 36) 
from uncomplicated malaria (UM; n = 70). Comparative statistics are reported
using a non-parametric univariate analysis (Kruskal-Wallis test or Chi-squared
test, as appropriate). Multivariate binary logistic regression was used to
examine differences in whole blood protein levels between groups (UM, SM, CM),
adjusting for differences due to ethnicity, age, parasitaemia and sex. Receiver
operating characteristic curve analysis was used to assess the diagnostic
accuracy of the ANGs in their ability to distinguish between UM, SM and CM.
Cumulative organ injury scores were obtained for patients with severe disease
based on the presence of acute renal failure, jaundice, severe anaemia,
circulatory collapse or coma.
RESULTS: ANG-1 and ANG-2 were readily detectable in whole blood. Compared to UM
there were significant decreases in ANG-1 (p < 0.001) and significant increases
in ANG-2 (p < 0.001) levels and the ratio of ANG-2: ANG-1 (p < 0.001) observed in
patients with SM and CM. This effect was independent of covariates (ethnicity,
age, parasitaemia, sex). Further, there was a significant decrease in ANG-1
levels in patients with SM (non-cerebral) versus CM (p < 0.001). In participants 
with severe disease, ANG-2, but not ANG-1, levels correlated with cumulative
organ injury scores; however, ANG-1 correlated with the presence of renal
dysfunction and coma. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis
demonstrated that the level of ANG-1, the level of ANG-2 or the ratio of ANG-2:
ANG-1 discriminated between individuals with UM and SM (area under the curve,
p-value: ANG-2, 0.763, p < 0.001; ANG-1, 0.884, p < 0.001; Ratio, 0.857, p <
0.001) or UM and CM (area under the curve, p-value: ANG-2, 0.772, p < 0.001;
ANG-1, 0.778, p < 0.001; Ratio, 0.820, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that whole blood ANG-1/2 levels are promising 
clinically informative biomarkers of disease severity in malarial syndromes.

BACKGROUND: In the absence of large scale, organized vector control programmes,
individual protective measures against mosquitoes are essential for reducing the 
transmission of diseases like malaria. Knowledge of the types and effectiveness
of mosquito control methods used by households can aid in the development and
promotion of preventive measures.
METHODS: A matched, population-based case control study was carried out in the
semi-urban region of Nouna, Burkina Faso. Surveys and mosquito captures were
conducted for each participating household. Data were analysed using conditional 
logistic regression and Pearson's product-moment correlations.
RESULTS: In Nouna, Burkina Faso, the main types of reported mosquito control
measures used included sleeping under bed nets (insecticide-treated and
untreated) and burning mosquito coils. Most of the study households kept animals 
within the compound or house at night. Insecticide house sprays, donkeys, rabbits
and pigs were significantly associated with a reduced risk of malaria only in
univariate analyses.
CONCLUSION: Given the conflicting results of the effects of zooprophylaxis from
previous studies, other community-based preventive measures, such as bed nets,
coils and insecticide house-spraying, may be of more benefit.

Blood glucose and prognosis in children with presumed severe malaria: is there a 
threshold for 'hypoglycaemia'?

OBJECTIVES: Hypoglycaemia (glucose <2.2 mmol/l) is a defining feature of severe
malaria, but the significance of other levels of blood glucose has not previously
been studied in children with severe malaria.
METHODS: A prospective study of 437 consecutive children with presumed severe
malaria was conducted in Mali. We defined hypoglycaemia as <2.2 mmol/l, low
glycaemia as 2.2-4.4 mmol/l and hyperglycaemia as >8.3 mmol/l. Associations
between glycaemia and case fatality were analysed for 418 children using logistic
regression models and a receiver operator curve (ROC).
RESULTS: There was a significant difference between blood glucose levels in
children who died (median 4.6 mmol/l) and survivors (median 7.6 mmol/l, P <
0.001). Case fatality declined from 61.5% of the hypoglycaemic children to 46.2% 
of those with low glycaemia, 13.4% of those with normal glycaemia and 7.6% of
those with hyperglycaemia (P < 0.001). Logistic regression showed an adjusted
odds ratio (AOR) of 0.75 (0.64-0.88) for case fatality per 1 mmol/l increase in
baseline blood glucose. Compared to a normal blood glucose, hypoglycaemia and low
glycaemia both significantly increased the odds of death (AOR 11.87, 2.10-67.00; 
and 5.21, 1.86-14.63, respectively), whereas hyperglycaemia reduced the odds of
death (AOR 0.34, 0.13-0.91). The ROC [area under the curve at 0.753 (95% CI
0.684-0.820)] indicated that glycaemia had a moderate predictive value for death 
and identified an optimal threshold at glycaemia <6.1 mmol/l, (sensitivity 64.5% 
and specificity 75.1%).
CONCLUSIONS: If there is a threshold of blood glucose which defines a worse
prognosis, it is at a higher level than the current definition of 2.2 mmol/l.

Factors associated with use and non-use of mosquito nets owned in Oromia and
Amhara regional states, Ethiopia.

Baume CA(1), Reithinger R, Woldehanna S.

Author information: 
(1)AED, 1825 Connecticut Ave NW Washington, DC 20009, USA. cbaume@aed.org

BACKGROUND: Many countries across sub-Saharan Africa are rapidly increasing
insecticide-treated net (ITN) coverage to combat malaria, but systematic data on 
the use of those ITNs and the factors affecting this use are scarce.
METHODS: A household survey was conducted during malaria season in 23 communities
of Amhara and Oromia Regional States, Ethiopia, stratified by degree of
urbanization (rural, peri-urban, or urban), whether or not they received indoor
residual spraying (IRS), and whether or not free nets had been distributed.
Descriptive statistics as well as univariate and multivariate logistic regression
analyses were used to describe household net ownership and identify factors
associated with use or non-use of nets already in the household. A qualitative
component consisting of observations of ITNs in households and several open-ended
questions provided further understanding of the reasons for ITN use and non-use.
RESULTS: Of 857 surveyed households, 91% owned at least one ITN, but only 65% of 
ITNs owned had been used the prior night. The multivariate analysis found that
the factors significantly associated with an ITN being used were regional state
(Amhara) (Odds Ratio [OR] = 0.61; 95% Confidence Interval [C.I.] 0.43 - 0.86]; p 
< 0.01), residing in a house sprayed with IRS (OR = 1.89; 95% C.I. 1.36 - 2.63; p
< 0.001), age of ITN (<12 months) (OR = 0.55; 95% C.I. 0.37 - 0.82; p < 0.01),
shape (conical) (OR = 2.27; 95% C.I. 1.10 - 4.68; p < 0.05), and paying for the
ITN rather than receiving it free (OR = 2.16; 95% C.I. 1.32 - 3.53; p < 0.01).
The most common reasons for ITN non-use identified through the qualitative
component of the study were: there are few mosquitoes around or malaria is not a 
serious problem; the ITN is no longer effective; ITN is in poor condition; the
ITN is being saved. Observations showed many ITNs hanging incorrectly, and some
being used for purposes other than as a bed net.
CONCLUSION: The very high ITN ownership in the study areas suggests that a
strategy targeting free nets to rural and poor households combined with support
for the commercial sector is an effective means of achieving high coverage. The
data suggests that use of ITNs owned could be increased by distribution of
conical ITNs, continued development of the commercial sector, replacement schemes
for worn-out ITNs, assistance with hanging of ITNs, and communication addressing 
misperceptions about ITNs.

Immunity to the asexual blood stage of Plasmodium falciparum is complex and
likely involves several effector mechanisms. Antibodies are thought to play a
critical role in malaria immunity, and a corresponding in vitro correlate of
antibody-mediated immunity has long been sought to facilitate malaria vaccine
development. The growth inhibition assay (GIA) measures the capacity of
antibodies to limit red blood cell (RBC) invasion and/or growth of P. falciparum 
in vitro. In humans, naturally acquired and vaccine-induced P.
falciparum-specific antibodies have growth-inhibitory activity, but it is unclear
if growth-inhibitory activity correlates with protection from clinical disease.
In a longitudinal study in Mali, purified IgGs, obtained from plasmas collected
before the malaria season from 220 individuals aged 2 to 10 and 18 to 25 years,
were assayed for growth-inhibitory activity. Malaria episodes were recorded by
passive surveillance over the subsequent 6-month malaria season. Logistic
regression showed that greater age (odds ratio [OR], 0.78; 95% confidence
interval [95% CI], 0.63 to 0.95; P = 0.02) and growth-inhibitory activity (OR,
0.50; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.85; P = 0.01) were significantly associated with
decreased malaria risk in children. A growth-inhibitory activity level of 40% was
determined to be the optimal cutoff for discriminating malaria-immune and
susceptible individuals in this cohort, with a sensitivity of 97.0%, but a low
specificity of 24.3%, which limited the assay's ability to accurately predict
protective immunity and to serve as an in vitro correlate of antibody-mediated
immunity. These data suggest that antibodies which block merozoite invasion of
RBC and/or inhibit the intra-RBC growth of the parasite contribute to but are not
sufficient for the acquisition of malaria immunity.

BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum malaria accounts for >1 million deaths
annually, mostly among young children in sub-Saharan Africa. Identifying those
individuals who are likely to die is crucial. Several factors have been
independently associated with death. Because malaria is a systemic disease, a
quantitative score combining such risk factors may be superior.
METHODS: We used both forward and backward stepwise logistic regression to select
the best predictors of death, as evaluated for 23,890 African children with
severe P. falciparum malaria. The study was conducted from December 2000 through 
May 2005 in 6 hospital-based research units (in Banjul in the Gambia, Blantyre in
Malawi, Kilifi in Kenya, Kumasi in Ghana, and Lambaréné and Libreville in Gabon) 
in a network established to study severe malaria in African children (ie, the
SMAC Network).
RESULTS: The Lambaréné Organ Dysfunction Score (LODS) combines 3 variables: coma,
prostration, and deep breathing. A LODS >0 (odd ratio, 9.6; 95% confidence
interval, 8.0-11.4) has 85% sensitivity to predict death, and a LODS <3 is highly
(98%) specific for survival.
CONCLUSIONS: The LODS is a simple clinical predictor of fatal malaria in African 
children. This score provides accurate and rapid identification of children
needing either referral or increased attention.

BACKGROUND: In Sub-Sahara Africa, malaria due to Plasmodium falciparum is the
main cause of ill health. Evaluation of malaria interventions, such as drugs and 
vaccines depends on clinical definition of the disease, which is still a
challenge due to lack of distinct malaria specific clinical features. Parasite
threshold is used in definition of clinical malaria in evaluation of
interventions. This however, is likely to be influenced by other factors such as 
transmission intensity as well as individual level of immunity against malaria.
METHODS: This paper describes step function and dose response model with
threshold parameter as a tool for estimation of parasite threshold for onset of
malaria fever in highlands (low transmission) and lowlands (high transmission
intensity) strata. These models were fitted using logistic regression stratified 
by strata and age groups (0-1, 2-3, 4-5, 6-9, and 10-19 years). Dose response
model was further extended to fit all age groups combined in each stratum.
Sub-sampling bootstrap was used to compute confidence intervals. Cross-sectional 
and passive case detection data from Korogwe district, north eastern Tanzania
were used.
RESULTS: Dose response model was better in the estimation of parasite thresholds.
Parasite thresholds (scale = log parasite/microL) were high in lowlands than in
highlands. In the lowlands, children in age group 4-5 years had the highest
parasite threshold (8.73) while individuals aged 10-19 years had the lowest
(6.81). In the highlands, children aged 0-1 years had the highest threshold
(7.12) and those aged 10-19 years had the lowest (4.62). Regression analysis with
all ages combined showed similar pattern of thresholds in both strata, whereby,
in the lowlands the threshold was highest in age group 2-5 years and lowest in
older individuals, while in the highlands was highest in age group 0-1 and
decreased with increased age. The sensitivity of parasite threshold by age group 
ranged from 64%-74% in the lowlands and 67%-97% in the highlands; while
specificity ranged between 67%-90% in the lowlands and 37%-73% in the highlands.
CONCLUSION: Dose response model with threshold parameter can be used to estimate 
parasite threshold associated with malaria fever onset. Parasite threshold were
lower in older individuals and in low malaria transmission area.

Plasmodium falciparum malaria is a leading global cause of infectious disease
burden. In areas in which P. falciparum transmission is holoendemic, such as
western Kenya, severe malarial anemia (SMA) results in high rates of pediatric
morbidity and mortality. Although the pathophysiological basis of SMA is
multifactorial, we recently discovered that suppression of unexplored
hematopoietic growth factors that promote erythroid and myeloid colony
development, such as stem cell growth factor (SCGF) (C-type lectin domain family 
member 11A [CLEC11A]), was associated with enhanced development of SMA and
reduced erythropoietic responses. To extend these investigations, the
relationships between a novel SCGF promoter variant (-539C/T, rs7246355), SMA
(hemoglobin [Hb] < 6.0 g/dl), and reduced erythropoietic responses (reticulocyte 
production index [RPI], <2.0) were investigated with Kenyan children (n = 486)
with falciparum malaria from western Kenya. Circulating SCGF was positively
correlated with hemoglobin levels (r = 0.251; P = 0.022) and the reticulocyte
production index (RPI) (r = 0.268; P = 0.025). Children with SMA also had lower
SCGF levels than those in the non-SMA group (P = 0.005). Multivariate logistic
regression analyses controlling for covariates demonstrated that individuals with
the homologous T allele were protected against SMA (odds ratio, 0.57; 95%
confidence interval [95% CI] 0.34 to 0.94; P = 0.027) relative to CC (wild-type) 
carriers. Carriers of the TT genotype also had higher SCGF levels in circulation 
(P = 0.018) and in peripheral blood mononuclear cell culture supernatants (P =
0.041), as well as an elevated RPI (P = 0.005) relative to individuals with the
CC genotype. The results presented here demonstrate that homozygous T at -539 in 
the SCGF promoter is associated with elevated SCGF production, enhanced
erythropoiesis, and protection against the development of SMA in children with
falciparum malaria.

BACKGROUND: Although the occurrence of malaria vector larvae in the valleys of
western Kenya highlands is well documented, knowledge of larval habitats in the
uphill sites is lacking. Given that most inhabitants of the highlands actually
dwell in the uphill regions, it is important to develop understanding of mosquito
breeding habitat stability in these sites in order to determine their potential
for larval control.
METHODS: A total of 128 potential larval habitats were identified in hilltops and
along the seasonal streams in the Sigalagala area of Kakamega district, western
Kenya. Water availability in the habitats was followed up daily from August 3,
2006 to February 23, 2007. A habitat is defined as stable when it remains aquatic
continuously for at least 12 d. Mosquito larvae were observed weekly. Frequencies
of aquatic, stable and larvae positive habitats were compared between the hilltop
and seasonal stream area using chi2-test. Factors affecting the presence/absence 
of Anopheles gambiae larvae in the highlands were determined using multiple
logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: Topography significantly affected habitat availability and stability.
The occurrence of aquatic habitats in the hilltop was more sporadic than in the
stream area. The percentage of habitat occurrences that were classified as stable
during the rainy season is 48.76% and 80.79% respectively for the hilltop and
stream area. Corresponding frequencies of larvae positive habitats were 0% in the
hilltop and 5.91% in the stream area. After the rainy season, only 23.42% of
habitat occurrences were stable and 0.01% larvae positive habitats were found in 
the hilltops, whereas 89.75% of occurrences remained stable in the stream area
resulting in a frequency of 12.21% larvae positive habitats. The logistic
regression analysis confirmed the association between habitat stability and
larval occurrence and indicated that habitat surface area was negatively
affecting the occurrence of An. gambiae larvae. While An. gambiae and An.
funestus larvae occurred throughout the study period along the streams, a total
of only 15 An. gambiae larvae were counted in the hilltops, and no An. funestus
were found. Moreover, no larvae managed to develop into adults in the hilltops,
and the density of adult An. gambiae was consistently low, averaging at 0.06
females per house per survey.
CONCLUSION: The occurrence of malaria vector larvae in the hilltop area was
uncommon as a result of the low availability and high instability of habitats. To
optimize the cost-effectiveness of malaria interventions in the western Kenya
highlands, larval control should be focused primarily along the streams, as these
are likely the only productive habitats at high altitude.

BACKGROUND: Malaria has traditionally been a major endemic disease in Equatorial 
Guinea. Although parasitaemia prevalence on the insular region has been
substantially reduced by vector control in the past few years, the prevalence in 
the mainland remains over 50% in children younger than five years. The aim of
this study is to investigate the risk factors for parasitaemia and treatment
seeking behaviour for febrile illness at country level, in order to provide
evidence that will reinforce the EG National Malaria Control Programme.
METHODS: The study was a cross-sectional survey of children 0 to 5 years old,
using a multistaged, stratified, cluster-selected sample at the national level.
It included a socio-demographic, health and dietary questionnaires,
anthropometric measurements, and thick and thin blood smears to determine the
Plasmodium infection. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to
determine risk factors for parasitaemia, taking into account the cluster design.
RESULTS: The overall prevalence of parasitemia was 50.9%; it was higher in rural 
(58.8%) compared to urban areas (44.0%, p = 0.06). Age was positively associated 
with parasitemia (p < 0.0001). In rural areas, risk factors included longer
distance to health facilities (p = 0.01) and a low proportion of households with 
access to protected water in the community (p = 0.02). Having had an episode of
cough in the 15 days prior to the survey was inversely related to parasitemia (p 
= 0.04). In urban areas, the risk factors were stunting (p = 0.005), not having
taken colostrum (p = 0.01), and that someone in the household slept under a bed
net (p = 0.002); maternal antimalarial medication intake during pregnancy (p =
0.003) and the household socio-economic status (p = 0.0002) were negatively
associated with parasitemia. Only 55% of children with fever were taken outside
their homes for care, and treatment seeking behaviour differed substantially
between rural and urban populations.
CONCLUSION: Results suggest that a national programme to fight malaria in
Equatorial Guinea should take into account the differences between rural and
urban communities in relation to risk factors for parasitaemia and treatment
seeking behaviour, integrate nutrition programmes, incorporate campaigns on the
importance of early treatment, and target appropriately for bed nets to reach the
under-fives.

A household matched case-control study design was used to explore associations
between household characteristics and malaria risk in seven study towns in the
hypoendemic area of Mpumalanga Province, South Africa. Controls were identified
from neighboring households of each case. Principle component analysis was used
to calculate a wealth index for households to allow comparison across
socioeconomic groups. Conditional univariate and multiple logistic regression
analyses were used to assess associations between household malaria risk and
potential risk factors. Univariate analysis demonstrated an increased household
malaria risk for people living in mud-walled houses compared with those in brick 
dwellings (OR=5.10, 95% CI 2.03-12.80, P=0.001). Multivariate analysis confirmed 
the association between malaria risk and mud-wall construction (OR=6.12, 95% CI
2.26-16.59, P=0.001) and demonstrated an association with opening windows after
retiring to sleep (OR=4.01, 95% CI 1.32-12.18, P=0.014). An inverse association
between household wealth, third (OR=0.24, 95% CI 0.09-0.65, P=0.005) and fourth
quartiles (OR=0.27, 95% CI 0.10-0.79, P=0.016), and malaria risk was observed.
Associations found here include increased household malaria risk and mud-wall
construction, the practice of opening of windows at night and relative household 
poverty. Education campaigns targeting risk behavior may reduce malaria risk, but
economic development is a more important intervention.

CONTEXT: Mass oral azithromycin distribution to affected communities is a
cornerstone of the World Health Organization's trachoma elimination program.
Antibiotics are provided to target the ocular strains of chlamydia that cause
trachoma, but may also be efficacious against respiratory disease, diarrhea, and 
malaria--frequent causes of childhood mortality in trachoma-endemic areas.
OBJECTIVE: To compare mortality rates of participants aged 1 to 9 years in
treated communities with those in untreated communities.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a cluster-randomized clinical
trial of mass azithromycin administration for trachoma control. Forty-eight
communities (known as subkebeles) were randomized into 1 of 3 treatment schedules
(annual treatment of all residents [15,902 participants], biannual treatment of
all residents [17,288 participants], or quarterly treatment of children only
[14,716 participants]) or into 1 group for which treatment was delayed by 1 year 
(control, 18,498 participants). Twelve subkebeles were randomized to each of the 
4 schedules with all children in each of the 3 communities being eligible for
treatment. The trial was conducted in a field setting in rural Ethiopia, May 2006
to May 2007.
INTERVENTIONS: A single dose of oral azithromycin (adults, 1 g; children, 20
mg/kg) was administered for treatment of ocular Chlamydia trachomatis infection. 
Antibiotic coverage levels for children aged 1 to 9 years exceeded 80% at all
visits.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The main outcome measure was the community-specific
mortality risk for children aged 1 to 9 years over the course of 1 year.
Mortality was measured by enumerative census at baseline and again after 1 year. 
Comparison of the risk of mortality was a prespecified outcome for the clinical
trial.
RESULTS: The odds ratio for childhood mortality in the intervention communities
was 0.51 (95% confidence interval, 0.29-0.90; P = .02; clustered logistic
regression) compared with the control group. In the treated communities, the
estimated overall mortality rate during this period for children aged 1 to 9
years in the untreated group was 8.3 per 1000 person-years (95% confidence
interval, 5.3-13.1), while among the treated communities, the estimated overall
mortality rate was 4.1 per 1000 person-years (95% confidence interval, 3.0-5.7)
for children aged 1 to 9 years.
CONCLUSION: In a trachoma-endemic area, mass distribution of oral azithromycin
was associated with reduced mortality in children.

Impact of a positive deviance approach to improve the effectiveness of an
iron-supplementation program to control nutritional anemia among rural Senegalese
pregnant women.

BACKGROUND: Iron supplementation through prenatal care remains the most
widespread strategy to control anemia during pregnancy, but its effectiveness is 
only partial, showing the need to address other approaches.
OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to measure the impact of a positive deviance 
approach to improve an iron-supplementation program among pregnant women in a
rural Senegalese area.
METHODS: A positive deviance approach (PD Micah) was compared with an ongoing
integrated nutrition and health program intervention (Micah) in a rural
Senegalese area. A pre-post evaluation was conducted using independent
cross-sectional samples with a total of 371 pregnant women. A sociodemographic
questionnaire was administered, and biologic and anthropometric measurements were
performed.
RESULTS: After 9 months of activities, the mean hemoglobin level rose from 93.9
to 100.7 g/L in the PD Micah group. Distribution of iron supplements through
community volunteers and implementation of healthy pregnancy promotion sessions
on a monthly basis improved the accessibility to 23.3% in the PD Micah group. No 
significant change was observed in the Micah group. Logistic regression analysis 
showed a significantly reduced risk of anemia in the PD Micah area (adjusted odds
ratio, 0.25; 95% confidence interval, 0.12 to 0.53).
CONCLUSIONS: This intervention shows that a community-based strategy, such as the
positive deviance approach, can contribute to improving the effectiveness of iron
supplementation during pregnancy.

Malaria has no effect on birth weight in Rwanda.

Vries PJ.

BACKGROUND: Malaria has a negative effect on pregnancy outcome, causing low birth
weight, premature birth and stillbirths, particularly in areas with high malaria 
transmission. In Rwanda, malaria transmission intensity ranges from high to nil, 
probably associated with variable altitudes. Overall, the incidence decreased
over the last six years (2002-2007). Therefore, the impact of malaria on birth
outcomes is also expected to vary over time and space.
METHODS: Obstetric indicators (birth weight and pregnancy outcome) and malaria
incidence were compared and analyzed to their association over time (2002-2007)
and space. Birth data from 12,526 deliveries were collected from maternity
registers of 11 different primary health centers located in different malaria
endemic areas. Malaria data for the same communities were collected from the
National Malaria Control Programme. Associations were sought with mixed effects
models and logistic regression.
RESULTS: In all health centres, a significant increase of birth weight over the
years was observed (p < 0.001) with a significant seasonal fluctuation. Malaria
incidence had no significant effect on birth weight. There was a slight but
significant decreasing effect of malaria incidence on the occurrence of premature
delivery (p-value 0.045) and still birth (p-value 0.009). Altitude showed a
slight but significant negative correlation with birth weight. Overall, a
decrease over the years of premature delivery (p = 0.010) and still birth (p =
0.036) was observed.
CONCLUSION: In Rwanda, birth weight and pregnancy outcome are not directly
influenced by malaria, which is in contrast to many other studied areas. Although
malaria incidence overall has declined and mean birth weight increased over the
studied period, no direct association was found between the two. Socio-economic
factors and improved nutrition could be responsible for birth weight changes in
recent years.

Health, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.

BACKGROUND: Severe malarial anemia (SMA) resulting from Plasmodium falciparum
infection is one of the leading causes of childhood mortality in sub-Saharan
Africa. The innate immune mediator macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF)
plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of SMA.
METHODS: To investigate the influence of MIF genetic variation on susceptibility 
to SMA, haplotypes of the MIF -173G/C and -794CATT5-8 polymorphisms were examined
in a cohort of Kenyan children.
RESULTS: A statistically significant relationship between increasing frequencies 
of longer CATT repeats at -794 and increasing severity of malarial anemia was
observed. In addition, there was a strong association between lower MIF
concentrations and longer CATT repeats. Multivariate logistic regression analyses
demonstrated that the 6G haplotype (ie, MIF -794CATT6/-173G) was associated with 
protection against SMA, whereas carriers of the 7C or 8C haplotype had increased 
risk of developing SMA. Furthermore, carriers of the 7C or 8C haplotype had
reduced plasma MIF levels during acute disease.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings demonstrate that variation in the MIF promoter
influences susceptibility to SMA and peripheral MIF production. However, the MIF 
-173 and -794 polymorphisms appear to have both independent and interactive
effects on different measures of disease severity, suggesting that MIF plays a
complex role in malarial pathogenesis.

The malaria severity score: a method for severity assessment and risk prediction 
of hospital mortality for falciparum malaria in adults.

Mohapatra MK(1), Das SP.

Author information: 
(1)V.S.S. Medical College and Hospital, Burla, Orissa.

BACKGROUND: There is paucity of research to quantify the severity and to predict 
the mortality risk of severe falciparum malaria even if it affects multiple organ
systems during the course of the disease. Therefore, the aim of the present study
is to develop a severity score for assessment of disease severity and risk
prediction in adult patients of severe falciparum malaria on the first day of
hospitalisation.
METHODS: A cohort of 2598 patients of falciparum malaria were enrolled in this
study of which 2089 patients were included as developmental sample and 509
patients as validation sample. Physiological variables were analyzed for defining
and assessment of severity of organ dysfunction (OD). The severity level and
corresponding severity score for each organ dysfunction were determined by
logistic regression analysis that took both the relative severity among the organ
systems and the degree of severity within an organ system into account. Risk of
mortality has been calculated for each score.
RESULTS: Physiological variables defined dysfunction in 7 organ systems with 3
levels of severity (I to III). Neurologic and renal dysfunction had 3 levels of
severity. Hematologic, cardiovascular, and respiratory dysfunction had 2 levels
of severity where as hepatic and metabolic dysfunction had 1 level of severity.
1,3, and 5 points were assigned to level I, II, and III severity of organ
dysfunction respectively. Malaria without any abnormal physiological variables
had been considered as no organ failure and assigned 0 score. The cumulative
scores in a patient is known as malaria severity score (MSS) that ranged from 0
to 21. Risk of mortality had been calculated for each score.
CONCLUSION: This prospective study provides an objective tool for assessing
severity levels for organ dysfunction and prediction of risk of mortality in
severe falciparum malaria which can be used for treatment and research. It has
been observed that no two patients of falciparum malaria are same in severity.
The severity varies over time and malaria can affect single or multiple organs
with different levels of severity which can be quantified as level I, II, and
III. Neurologic and renal dysfunction were the most severe with level III
severity, followed by haematologic, cardiovascular, and respiratory dysfunction
with level-II severity, as well as hepatic and metabolic dysfunction the least
severe with level-I severity. Patient of malaria can be stratified as low,
intermediate, and high risk depending on the MSS. With the help of MSS daily risk
estimates and recovery time of OD can be determined.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the determinants of malaria in Anhui province during the
year of 2004-2006.
METHODS: A GIS-based database of malaria at the township scale of Anhui province 
was established, using remote sensing and spatial analysis technologies. Methods 
on statistical analysis, principal component analysis combined with logistic
regression analysis were synthetically used to analyze the association between
malaria and environmental factors.
RESULTS: Malaria epidemics in Anhui province during 2004-2006 mainly occurred in 
the northern districts of Huai River, and the epidemics had become more serious
yearly. The determinants of malaria at the township scale mainly included factors
as temperature, rainfall, normalized difference vegetable index and elevation. If
the lowest temperature in a year, which appeared the fourth principal component
of the temperature index series, increased by one unit, the probability of
incidence of malaria would decrease by 33%. If the total annual rainfall, which
was ihe first principal component of the rainfall index series, increased by one 
unit, the probability would decrease by 27%. If the elevation increased by 10
meters, the probability would decrease by 2%. However, he relationship between
Normalized Difference Vegetable Index (NDVI) and the probability of incidence of 
malaria was different. If the NDVI had a one unit increase, the probability would
increase 3.28 times.
CONCLUSION: The northern districts of Huai River during 2004-2006 appeared to be 
a new spatio-temporal cluster when reemergence of malaria epidemics had occurred 
in Auhui province since 2000. Terrain and physiognomy, nature and circumstances
factors, such as temperature and rainfall had affected the incidence rates of
malaria. Our research data from Anhui province would provide some important
references to the discovery of main reasons on the reemergence of malaria
epidemics since 2000, especially in the central geographic areas of China.

BACKGROUND: Infections during pregnancy may have serious consequences for both
mother and baby. Assessment of risk factors for infections informs planning of
interventions and analysis of the impact of infections on health outcomes.
OBJECTIVES: To describe risk factors for helminths, malaria and HIV in pregnant
Ugandan women before intervention in a trial of de-worming in pregnancy.
METHODS: The trial recruited 2,507 pregnant women between April 2003 and November
2005. Participants were interviewed and blood and stool samples obtained;
location of residence at enrolment was mapped. Demographic, socioeconomic,
behavioral and other risk factors were modelled using logistic regression.
RESULTS: There was a high prevalence of helminth, malaria and HIV infection, as
previously reported. All helminths and malaria parasitemia were more common in
younger women, and education was protective against every infection. Place of
birth and/or tribe affected all helminths in a pattern consistent with the
geographical distribution of helminth infections in Uganda. Four different
geohelminths (hookworm, Trichuris, Ascaris and Trichostrongylus) showed a
downwards trend in prevalence during the enrolment period. There was a negative
association between hookworm and HIV, and between hookworm and low CD4 count
among HIV-positive women. Locally, high prevalence of schistosomiasis and HIV
occurred in lakeshore communities.
CONCLUSIONS: Interventions for helminths, malaria and HIV need to target young
women both in and out of school. Antenatal interventions for malaria and HIV
infection must continue to be promoted. Women originating from a high risk area
for a helminth infection remain at high risk after migration to a lower-risk
area, and vice versa, but overall, geohelminths seem to be becoming less common
in this population. High risk populations, such as fishing communities, require
directed effort against schistosomiasis and HIV infection.

We identified individual factors associated with IPT use, by comparing
characteristics of pregnant women who use IPT to those who do not. A
cross-sectional study was conducted in antenatal clinics in Buea, Cameroon, from 
December 2006 to December 2007. Information on factors: age, parity, gravidity,
gestational age, level of education, use of insecticide treated nets (ITN),
socioeconomic status and IPT use was collected through interview and filled in a 
questionnaire. Data was entered using EPIDATA version 3 and analysis done using
STATA version 8.2. A total of 527 pregnant women were interviewed with a mean
(+/-SD) age of 26.45+/-5.37 years. 69.71% of the pregnant women used at least two
doses of IPT. Logistic regression revealed women with higher educational status
were more likely to use IPT compared to those with lower educational status
(OR=3.14, 95% CI=1.20-8.25, p=0.02). Meanwhile, multigravid women tend to use IPT
less than their primigravid counterparts (OR=0.47, 95% CI=0.26-0.84, p=0.01).
There was no evidence that maternal age, parity, marital status, gestational age,
use of ITN and socioeconomic status were each associated to IPT use. In antenatal
clinics in Buea, South Western Cameroon, educational status and gravidity are the
key determinants of IPT use.

BACKGROUND: In 2006, a cluster of malaria deaths in the highly endemic Jalpaiguri
district, West Bengal, India, led to assignment of additional resources. Malaria 
deaths decreased, but continued to occur. A study was conducted to identify the
risk factors for residual malaria deaths.
METHODS: Malaria death was defined as a death from fever with microscopically
confirmed Plasmodium falciparum among residents of Jalpaiguri during 2007-2008.
For each case, three age-, sex- and locality-matched controls were recruited
among microscopically confirmed falciparum malaria patients cured during the same
period. Clinical and treatment information was abstracted from records.
Information about knowledge about malaria, presence of bed nets and DDT spraying 
was collected through interviews of the close relatives of study subjects. Odds
ratio (OR) were calculated using multivariate methods.
RESULTS: 51 malaria deaths were matched with 153 controls, which did not differ
by age (median: 35 versus 36 years) and proportion of males (63% versus 63%). On 
multiple logistic regression analysis, compared with survivors, malaria deaths
were more likely to have been admitted with already existing complications [OR = 
4.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.6-10)], treated at a private facility (OR =
3.7, 95% CI = 1.2-12), received treatment after 48 hours of fever onset (OR = 14,
95% CI = 2.9-64), received chloroquine (OR = 13.3, 95% CI = 3.7-47). Households
of the deceased were also more likely to miss bed nets (OR = 6.3, 95% CI =
1.9-24) and DDT spraying (OR = 9.2, 95% CI = 2.8-31).
CONCLUSION: Elimination of malaria deaths will require education of providers for
prompt referral before complications, engagement of the private sector, community
awareness for early treatment as well as scaled-up use of bed nets use and DDT.
Use of newer generation anti-malarials must to be generalized.

Spatial and temporal distribution of the malaria mosquito Anopheles arabiensis in
northern Sudan: influence of environmental factors and implications for vector
control.

BACKGROUND: Malaria is an important public health problem in northern Sudan, but 
little is known about the dynamics of its transmission. Given the characteristic 
low densities of Anopheles arabiensis and the difficult terrain in this area,
future vector control strategies are likely to be based on area-wide integrated
pest management (AW-IPM) that may include the sterile insect technique (SIT). To 
support the planning and implementation of future AW-IPM activities, larval
surveys were carried out to provide key data on spatial and seasonal dynamics of 
local vector populations.
METHODS: Monthly cross-sectional larval surveys were carried out between March
2005 and May 2007 in two localities (Dongola and Merowe) adjacent to the river
Nile. A stratified random sampling strategy based on the use of Remote Sensing
(RS), Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and the Global Positioning System
(GPS) was used to select survey locations. Breeding sites were mapped using GPS
and data on larval density and breeding site characteristics were recorded using 
handheld computers. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression models were
used to identify breeding site characteristics associated with increased risk of 
presence of larvae. Seasonal patterns in the proportion of breeding sites
positive for larvae were compared visually to contemporaneous data on climate and
river height.
RESULTS: Of a total of 3,349 aquatic habitats sampled, 321 (9.6%) contained An.
arabiensis larvae. The frequency with which larvae were found varied markedly by 
habitat type. Although most positive sites were associated with temporary
standing water around the margins of the main Nile channel, larvae were also
found at brickworks and in areas of leaking pipes and canals - often far from the
river. Close to the Nile channel, a distinct seasonal pattern in larval
populations was evident and appeared to be linked to the rise and fall of the
river level. These patterns were not evident in vector populations breeding in
artificial water sources away from the river.
CONCLUSION: The GIS-based survey strategy developed in this study provides key
data on the population dynamics of An. arabiensis in Northern State. Quantitative
estimates of the contributions of various habitat types and their proximity to
settlements provide a basis for planning a strategy for reducing malaria risk by 
elimination of the vector population.

BACKGROUND: The introduction of new anti-malarial treatment that is effective,
but more expensive, raises questions about whether the high level of
effectiveness observed in clinical trials can be found in a context of family
use. The objective of this study was to determine the factors related to
adherence, when using the amodiaquine/sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (AQ/SP)
association, a transitory strategy before ACT implementation in Senegal.
METHODS: The study was conducted in five rural dispensaries. Children, between
two and 10 years of age, who presented mild malaria were recruited at the time of
the consultation and were prescribed AQ/SP. The child's primary caretaker was
questioned at home on D3 about treatment compliance and factors that could have
influenced his or her adherence to treatment. A logistic regression model was
used for the analyses.
RESULTS: The study sample included 289 children. The adherence rate was 64.7%.
Two risks factors for non-adherence were identified: the children's age (8-10
years) (ORa = 3.07 [1.49-6.29]; p = 0.004); and the profession of the head of
household (retailer/employee versus farmer) (ORa = 2.71 [1.34-5.48]; p = 0.006). 
Previously seeking care (ORa = 0.28 [0.105-0.736], p=0.001] satisfaction with
received information (ORa = 0.45 [0.24-0.84]; p = 0.013), and the quality of
history taking (ORa = 0.38 [0.21-0.69]; p = 0.001) were significantly associated 
with good compliance.
CONCLUSION: The results of the study show the importance of information and
communication between caregivers and health center staff. The experience gained
from this therapeutic transition emphasizes the importance of information given
to the patients at the time of the consultation and drug delivery in order to
improve drug use and thus prevent the emergence of rapid drug resistance.

BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to compare cases of imported malaria 
originating from the Spanish ex-colony of Equatorial Guinea (EG) with those
originating from the rest of Africa (RA).
METHODS: All the African cases detected in Barcelona between 1989 and 2007 were
investigated in a retrospective analysis. Clinical-epidemiological variables such
as sex, age, visiting friends and relatives (VFR), species, hospital admission
and chemo-prophylaxis were compared. Data were analysed by logistic regression,
calculating the Odds Ratio (OR) and 95% Confidence Intervals (95% CI).
RESULTS: Of the 489 African patients, 279 (57,1%) had been born in EG and 210
(42,9%) in the rest of Africa. The cumulative incidence of imported malaria among
those from EG was 179.6 per thousand inhabitants, while in those from the RA it
was 33.7 per thousand (p < 0.001). Compliance with chemoprophylaxis (CP) was very
low, but there were no differences between the two groups. Comparing those from
EG to those from RA, the former were characterized by having more patients in the
visiting friends and relatives (VFR) category, and more individuals younger than 
15 years or older than 37 years, and more women. They also visited a traveller's 
health centre more often, had fewer hospital admissions and were less likely to
reside in the inner city.
CONCLUSION: Cases of imported malaria originating in Africa, are more likely to
come from the Spanish ex-colony of EG, and VFR are more likely to be affected. It
is recommended that developed countries promote prevention programmes, such as CP
advice directed at African immigrants, and develop programmes of cooperation
against malaria in their ex-colonies.

A cross-sectional survey of agricultural areas, combined with routinely monitored
mosquito larval information, was conducted in urban Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, to
investigate how agricultural and geographical features may influence the presence
of Anopheles larvae. Data were integrated into a geographical information systems
framework, and predictors of the presence of Anopheles larvae in farming areas
were assessed using multivariate logistic regression with independent random
effects. It was found that more than 5% of the study area (total size 16.8 km2)
was used for farming in backyard gardens and larger open spaces. The proportion
of habitats containing Anopheles larvae was 1.7 times higher in agricultural
areas compared to other areas (95% confidence interval = 1.56-1.92). Significant 
geographic predictors of the presence of Anopheles larvae in gardens included
location in lowland areas, proximity to river, and relatively impermeable soils. 
Agriculture-related predictors comprised specific seedbed types, mid-sized
gardens, irrigation by wells, as well as cultivation of sugar cane or leafy
vegetables. Negative predictors included small garden size, irrigation by tap
water, rainfed production and cultivation of leguminous crops or fruit trees.
Although there was an increased chance of finding Anopheles larvae in
agricultural sites, it was found that breeding sites originated by urban
agriculture account for less than a fifth of all breeding sites of malaria
vectors in Dar es Salaam. It is suggested that strategies comprising an
integrated malaria control effort in malaria-endemic African cities include
participatory involvement of farmers by planting shade trees near larval
habitats.

Present habitat suitability for Anopheles atroparvus (Diptera, Culicidae) and its
coincidence with former malaria areas in mainland Portugal.

Malaria was a major health problem in the first half of the 20th Century in
mainland Portugal. Nowadays, although the disease is no longer endemic, there is 
still the risk of future endemic infections due to the continuous occurrence of
imported cases and the possibility of transmission in the country by Anopheles
atroparvus Van Thiel, 1927. Since vector abundance constitute one of the foremost
factors in malaria transmission, we have created several habitat suitability
models to describe this vector species' current distribution. Three different
correlative models; namely (i) a multilayer perceptron artificial neural network 
(MLP-ANN); (ii) binary logistic regression (BLR); and (iii) Mahalanobis distance 
were used to combine the species records with a set of five environmental
predictors. Kappa coefficient values from k-fold cross-validation records showed 
that binary logistic regression produced the best predictions, while the other
two models also produced acceptable results. Therefore, in order to reduce
uncertainty, the three suitability models were combined. The resulting model
identified high suitability for An. atroparvus in the majority of the country
with exception of the northern and central coastal areas. Malaria distribution
during the last endemic period in the country was also compared with the combined
suitability model, and a high degree of spatial agreement was obtained (kappa =
0.62). It was concluded that habitat suitability for malaria vectors can
constitute valuable information on the assessment of several spatial attributes
of the disease. In addition, the results suggest that the spatial distribution of
An. atroparvus in the country remains very similar to the one known about seven
decades ago.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effect of the severity of maternal anaemia on various 
perinatal outcomes.
DESIGN: A cross-sectional study.
SETTING: Labour Ward, Muhimbili National Hospital, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
METHODS: The haemoglobin of eligible pregnant women admitted for delivery between
15 November 2002 and 15 February 2003 was measured. Data on socio-demographic
characteristics, iron supplementation, malaria prophylaxis, blood transfusion
during current pregnancy, and current and previous pregnancy outcomes were
collected and analysed. Anaemia was classified according to the World Health
Organization (WHO) standards: normal--Hb > or = 11.0 g/dl; mild--Hb 9.0-10.9
g/dl; moderate--Hb 7.0-8.9 g/dl; and severe--Hb < 7.0 g/dl. Logistic regression
analysis was performed to estimate the severity of anaemia. The following outcome
measures were used: preterm delivery (<37 weeks), Apgar score, stillbirth, early 
neonatal death, low birth weight (LBW) (<2500 g) and very low birth weight (VLBW)
(<1500 g).
RESULTS: A total of 1174 anaemic and 547 non-anaemic women were enrolled. Their
median age was 24 years (range 14-46 years) and median parity was 2 (range 0-17).
The prevalence of anaemia and severe anaemia was 68% and 5.8%, respectively. The 
risk of preterm delivery increased significantly with the severity of anaemia,
with odds ratios of 1.4, 1.4 and 4.1 respectively for mild, moderate and severe
anaemia. The corresponding risks for LBW and VLBW were 1.2 and 1.7, 3.8 and 1.5, 
and 1.9 and 4.2 respectively.
CONCLUSION: The risks of preterm delivery and LBW increased in proportion to the 
severity of maternal anaemia.

OBJECTIVES: To examine the associations between household Plasmodium falciparum
infection and a number of factors including domestic animal ownership, potential 
mosquito breeding sites, indoor darkness, density of people, distance between
dwelling structures, and insecticide-treated bed net use.
METHODS: Analyses were based on data collected from a household survey conducted 
in Macha, Zambia. Thirty-four households with recurrent malaria infection in
2005-2008 were selected as case households and compared with 37 control
households with no malaria infection randomly selected from the same geographic
area. Logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with
household P. falciparum infection.
RESULTS: In multivariate analysis, cattle ownership was associated with reduced
risk of P. falciparum infection (adjusted odds ratio = 0.19; 95% CI = 0.05-0.69),
as was increased distance between dwelling structures (aOR = 0.26; 95% CI =
0.07-0.98). Ownership of the highest category of cattle, goats, dogs, or cats
dramatically reduced the risk of P. falciparum infection (aOR = 0.13; 95% CI =
0.03-0.56).
CONCLUSION: Domestic animal, in particular cattle, ownership and greater distance
between dwelling structures were associated with reduced risk of recurrent P.
falciparum infection at the household level. These factors should be further
investigated as supplemental measures for malaria control in rural African
settings.

A country-wide malaria survey in Mozambique. II. Malaria attributable proportion 
of fever and establishment of malaria case definition in children across
different epidemiological settings.

BACKGROUND: Protection against clinical malaria episodes is acquired slowly after
frequent exposure to malaria parasites. This is reflected by a decrease with
increasing age in both parasite density and incidence of clinical episodes. In
many settings of stable malaria transmission, the presence of asymptomatic
malaria parasite carriers is common and the definition of clinical malaria
remains uncertain.
METHODS: Between February 2002 and April 2003, a country-wide malaria survey was 
conducted in 24 districts of Mozambique, aiming to characterize the malaria
transmission intensities and to estimate the proportion of fever cases
attributable to malaria infections in order to establish the malaria case
definition. A total of 8,816 children less than ten years of age were selected
for the study. Axillary temperature was measured in all participating subjects
and finger prick blood collections were taken to prepare thick and thin films for
identification of parasite species and determination of parasite density. The
proportion of fever cases attributable to malaria infection was estimated using a
logistic regression of the fever on a monotonic function of the parasite density 
and, using bootstrap facilities, bootstrapped estimated confidence intervals, as 
well as the sensitivity and specificity for different parasite density cut-offs
were produced.
RESULTS: Overall, the prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum was 52.4%
(4,616/8,816). The prevalence of fever (axillary temperature >or= 37.5 degrees C)
was 9.4% (766/8,816). Fever episodes peaked among children below 12 months of
life [15.1% (206/1,517)]. The lowest fever prevalence of 5.9% (67/1,224) was
recorded amongst children between five and seven years of age. Among 4,098
parasitized children, 498/4,098 (13.02%) had fever. The prevalence of malaria
infections associated with fever peaked among children in the less than twelve
months age group and thereafter decreased rapidly with increasing age (p <
0.001). High parasite densities were significantly associated with fever (p <
0.04). The proportion of fever attributed to malaria was 37.8% (95% CI 32.9% -
42.7%). An age-specific pattern was observed with significant variations across
different regions in the country. In general, among children less than 12 months 
of life, the proportion of fever attributed to malaria infection was 43.5% (95%
CI 25.8% - 61.2%), in children aged between 12 and 59 months of age was 39.6%
(95% CI 30.3% - 48.9%), and among children aged between 5 and 10 years old was
21.5% (95% CI 11.6% - 31.4%).
CONCLUSION: This study confirms that malaria remains a major cause of febrile
illness during childhood. It also defines the relation between parasite density
and fever and how this varies with age and region. This may help guide case
definition for clinical trials of preventive tools, as well as provide
definitions that may improve the precision of measurement of the burden of
disease.

BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of information regarding glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency in endemic areas for malaria in Latin America.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This study determined the prevalence of the G6PD 
deficiency in 200 male non-consanguineous individuals residing in the Ismail Aziz
Community, on the outskirts of Manaus (Brazilian Amazon). Six individuals (3%)
were deficient using the qualitative Brewer's test. Gel electrophoresis showed
that five of these patients were G6PD A(-). The deficiency was not associated
with the ethnic origin (P = 0.571). In a multivariate logistic regression
analysis, G6PD deficiency protected against three or more episodes of malaria (P 
= 0.049), independently of the age, and was associated with a history of jaundice
(P = 0.020) and need of blood transfusion (P = 0.045) during previous treatment
for malarial infection, independently of the age and the previous malarial
exposure.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The frequency of G6PD deficiency was similar to other
studies performed in Brazil and the finding of a predominant G6PD A(-) variant
will help the clinical management of patients with drug-induced haemolysis. The
history of jaundice and blood transfusion during previous malarial infection may 
trigger the screening of patients for G6PD deficiency. The apparent protection
against multiple malarial infections in an area primarily endemic for Plasmodium 
vivax needs further investigation.

BACKGROUND: Historically, environmental management has brought important
achievements in malaria control and overall improvements of health conditions.
Currently, however, implementation is often considered not to be cost-effective. 
A community-based environmental management for malaria control was conducted in
Dar es Salaam between 2005 and 2007. After community sensitization, two drains
were cleaned followed by maintenance. This paper assessed the impact of the
intervention on community awareness, prevalence of malaria infection, and
Anopheles larval presence in drains.
METHODS: A survey was conducted in neighbourhoods adjacent to cleaned drains; for
comparison, neighbourhoods adjacent to two drains treated with larvicides and two
drains under no intervention were also surveyed. Data routinely collected by the 
Urban Malaria Control Programme were also used. Diverse impacts were evaluated
through comparison of means, odds ratios (OR), logistic regression, and time
trends calculated by moving averages.
RESULTS: Individual awareness of health risks and intervention goals were
significantly higher among sensitized neighbourhoods. A reduction in the odds of 
malaria infection during the post-cleaning period in intervention neighbourhoods 
was observed when compared to the pre-cleaning period (OR = 0.12, 95% CI
0.05-0.3, p < 0.001). During the post-cleaning period, a higher risk of infection
(OR = 1.7, 95% CI 1.1-2.4, p = 0.0069) was observed in neighbourhoods under no
intervention compared to intervention ones. Eighteen months after the initial
cleaning, one of the drains was still clean due to continued maintenance efforts 
(it contained no waste materials and the water was flowing at normal velocity). A
three-month moving average of the percentage of water habitats in that drain
containing pupae and/or Anopheles larvae indicated a decline in larval density.
In the other drain, lack of proper resources and local commitment limited
success.
CONCLUSION: Although environmental management was historically coordinated by
authoritarian/colonial regimes or by industries/corporations, its successful
implementation as part of an integrated vector management framework for malaria
control under democratic governments can be possible if four conditions are
observed: political will and commitment, community sensitization and
participation, provision of financial resources for initial cleaning and
structural repairs, and inter-sectoral collaboration. Such effort not only is
expected to reduce malaria transmission, but has the potential to empower
communities, improve health and environmental conditions, and ultimately
contribute to poverty alleviation and sustainable development.

BACKGROUND: Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a multifunctional
cytokine implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of human diseases including
inflammatory neurological diseases. Its role in the pathogenesis of cerebral
malaria is unknown. Cerebral malaria is a life-threatening complication of
falciparum malaria with approximately 20%-30% of patients dying despite
appropriate anti-malarial treatment. The reason for this cerebral malaria
mortality is still unknown although host proinflammatory factors have been shown 
to be evidently important. The current study investigated the role of circulating
MIF in the pathogenesis and outcomes of cerebral malaria.
FINDINGS: Three categories of subjects contributed to this study: healthy
controls subjects, mild malaria patients, and cerebral malaria patients. The
cerebral malaria patients were further grouped into cerebral malaria survivors
and cerebral malaria non-survivors. MIF levels in the peripheral blood plasma,
obtained at the time of enrollment, were measured using standard ELISA methods.
In logistic regression on cerebral malaria patients, log MIF levels were found to
be significantly associated with fatal outcome (odds ratio 4.0; 95%CI 1.6, 9.8; p
= 0.003). In multinomial logistic regression log MIF levels were found to be
significantly associated with patient category (p = 0.004).
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that elevated levels of MIF in the peripheral
blood of cerebral malaria patients may be associated with fatal outcomes.

Age-dependent acquisition of protective immunity to malaria in riverine
populations of the Amazon Basin of Brazil.

Five community-based cross-sectional surveys of malaria morbidity and associated 
risk factors in remote riverine populations in northwestern Brazil showed average
parasite rates of 4.2% (thick-smear microscopy) and 14.4% (polymerase chain
reaction [PCR]) in the overall population, with a spleen rate of 13.9% among
children 2-9 years of age. Plasmodium vivax was 2.8 times more prevalent than P. 
falciparum, with rare instances of P. malariae and mixed-species infections
confirmed by PCR; 9.6% of asymptomatic subjects had parasitemias detected by PCR.
Low-grade parasitemia detected by PCR only was a risk factor for anemia, after
controlling for age and other covariates. Although clinical and subclinical
infections occurred in all age groups, the risk of infection and disease
decreased significantly with increasing age, after adjustment for several
covariates in multilevel logistic regression models. These findings suggest that 
the continuous exposure to hypo- or mesoendemic malaria may induce significant
anti-parasite and anti-disease immunity in native Amazonians.

BACKGROUND: Knowledge of geography is integral to the study of insect-borne
infectious disease such as malaria. This study was designed to evaluate whether
geographic parameters are associated with malarial infection in the East Sepik
province of Papua New Guinea (PNG), a remote area where malaria is a major cause 
of morbidity and mortality.
METHODS: A global positioning system (GPS) unit was used at each village to
collect elevation, latitude and longitude data. Concurrently, a sketch map of
each village was generated and the villages were sub-divided into regions of
roughly equal populations. Blood samples were taken from subjects in each region 
using filter paper collection. The samples were later processed using nested PCR 
for qualitative determination of malarial infection. The area was mapped using
the GPS-information and overlaid with prevalence data. Data tables were examined 
using traditional chi square statistical techniques. A logistic regression
analysis was then used to determine the significance of geographic risk factors
including, elevation, distance from administrative centre and village of
residence.
RESULTS: Three hundred and thirty-two samples were included (24% of the total
estimated population). Ninety-six were positive, yielding a prevalence of 29%.
Chi square testing within each village found a non-random distribution of cases
across sub-regions (p < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression techniques
suggested malarial infection changed with elevation (OR = 0.64 per 10 m, p <
0.05) and distance from administrative centre (OR = 1.3 per 100 m, p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that malarial infection is significantly and
independently associated with lower elevation and greater distance from
administrative centre in a rural area in PNG. This type of analysis can provide
information that may be used to target specific areas in developing countries for
malaria prevention and treatment.

Impact of insecticide-treated bednets (ITNs) on preventing malaria may be
minimized if they are not used by vulnerable populations. Among ITN-owning
households from 15 standardized national surveys from 2003 to 2006, we identify
factors associated with ITN use among children younger than 5 years of age and
make comparisons of ITN use among children and pregnant women across countries.
Within ITN-owning households, many children and pregnant women are still not
using them. Between-country analysis with linear regression showed child ITN use 
increases as intra-household access to ITNs increases (P = 0.020, R2 = 0.404),
after controlling for season and survey year. Results from within-country
logistic regression analyses were consistent with between-country analysis
showing intra-household access to ITNs is the strongest and most consistent
determinant of use among children. The gaps in ITN use and possession will likely
persist in the absence of achieving a ratio of no more than two people per ITN.

Mortality risk among children admitted in a large-scale nutritional program in
Niger, 2006.

Lapidus N(1), Minetti A, Djibo A, Guerin PJ, Hustache S, Gaboulaud V, Grais RF.

Author information: 
(1)Epicentre, Paris, France.

BACKGROUND: In 2006, the Médecins sans Frontières nutritional program in the
region of Maradi (Niger) included 68,001 children 6-59 months of age with either 
moderate or severe malnutrition, according to the NCHS reference
(weight-for-height<80% of the NCHS median, and/or mid-upper arm circumference<110
mm for children taller than 65 cm and/or presence of bipedal edema). Our
objective was to identify baseline risk factors for death among children
diagnosed with severe malnutrition using the newly introduced WHO growth
standards. As the release of WHO growth standards changed the definition of
severe malnutrition, which now includes many children formerly identified as
moderately malnourished with the NCHS reference, studying this new category of
children is crucial.
METHODOLOGY: Program monitoring data were collected from the medical records of
all children admitted in the program. Data included age, sex, height, weight,
MUAC, clinical signs on admission including edema, and type of discharge
(recovery, death, and default/loss to follow up). Additional data included
results of a malaria rapid diagnostic test due to Plasmodium falciparum
(Paracheck) and whether the child was a resident of the region of Maradi or came 
from bordering Nigeria to seek treatment. Multivariate logistic regression was
performed on a subset of 27,687 children meeting the new WHO growth standards
criteria for severe malnutrition (weight-for-height<-3 Z score, mid-upper arm
circumference<110 mm for children taller than 65 cm or presence of bipedal
edema). We explored two different models: one with only basic anthropometric data
and a second model that included perfunctory clinical signs.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In the first model including only weight, height, sex and
presence of edema, the risk factors retained were the weight/height(1.84) ratio
(OR: 5,774; 95% CI: [2,284; 14,594]) and presence of edema (7.51 [5.12; 11.0]). A
second model, taking into account supplementary data from perfunctory clinical
examination, identified other risk factors for death: apathy (9.71 [6.92; 13.6]),
pallor (2.25 [1.25; 4.05]), anorexia (1.89 [1.35; 2.66]), fever>38.5 degrees C
(1.83 [1.25; 2.69]), and age below 1 year (1.42 [1.01; 1.99]).
CONCLUSIONS: Although clinicians will continue to perform screening using
clinical signs and anthropometry, these risk indicators may provide additional
criteria for the assessment of absolute and relative risk of death. Better
appraisal of the child's risk of death may help orientate the child towards
either hospitalization or ambulatory care. As the transition from the NCHS growth
reference to the WHO standards will increase the number of children classified as
severely malnourished, further studies should explore means to identify children 
at highest risk of death within this group using simple and standardized
indicators.

Pattern of drug utilization for treatment of uncomplicated malaria in urban Ghana
following national treatment policy change to artemisinin-combination therapy.

BACKGROUND: Change of first-line treatment of uncomplicated malaria to
artemisinin-combination therapy (ACT) is widespread in Africa. To expand
knowledge of safety profiles of ACT, pharmacovigilance activities are included in
the implementation process of therapy changes. Ghana implemented first-line
therapy of artesunate-amodiaquine in 2005. Drug utilization data is an important 
component of determining drug safety, and this paper describes how anti-malarials
were prescribed within a prospective pharmacovigilance study in Ghana following
anti-malarial treatment policy change.
METHODS: Patients with diagnosis of uncomplicated malaria were recruited from
pharmacies of health facilities throughout Accra in a cohort-event monitoring
study. The main drug utilization outcomes were the relation of patient age,
gender, type of facility attended, mode of diagnosis and concomitant treatments
to the anti-malarial regimen prescribed. Logistic regression was used to predict 
prescription of nationally recommended first-line therapy and concomitant
prescription of antibiotics.
RESULTS: The cohort comprised 2,831 patients. Curative regimens containing an
artemisinin derivative were given to 90.8% (n = 2,574) of patients, although 33% 
(n = 936) of patients received an artemisinin-based monotherapy. Predictors of
first-line therapy were laboratory-confirmed diagnosis, age >5 years, and
attending a government facility. Analgesics and antibiotics were the most
commonly prescribed concomitant medications, with a median of two
co-prescriptions per patient (range 1-9). Patients above 12 years were
significantly less likely to have antibiotics co-prescribed than patients under
five years; those prescribed non-artemisinin monotherapies were more likely to
receive antibiotics. A dihydroartemisinin-amodiaquine combination was the most
used therapy for children under five years of age (29.0%, n = 177).
CONCLUSION: This study shows that though first-line therapy recommendations may
change, clinical practice may still be affected by factors other than the
decision or ability to diagnose malaria. Age, diagnostic confirmation and
suspected concurrent conditions lead to benefit:risk assessments for individual
patients by clinicians as to which anti-malarial treatment to prescribe. This has
implications for adherence to policy changes aiming to implement effective use of
ACT. These results should inform education of health professionals and rational
drug use policies to reduce poly-pharmacy, and also suggest a potential positive 
impact of increased access to testing for malaria both within health facilities
and in homes.

BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum malaria is a common cause of morbidity in
African children, but identifying those who are likely to die is problematic.
Previous studies suggested that circulating malarial pigment might be a useful
predictor of severity, but none were large enough to detect any association with 
mortality.
METHODS: We used thick blood smears performed on admission for 26,296 children
hospitalized with P. falciparum at 1 of 6 hospitals in the Severe Malaria in
African Children network to assess the prognostic value of pigment-containing
granulocytes, monocytes, and parasites.
RESULTS: Although at all but one of the study sites the risk of mortality for
subjects presenting with >5 pigmented granulocytes per 200 white blood cells was 
higher than in subjects with no pigmented granulocytes, adjusted odds ratios
estimated through logistic regression, which included other established markers
of severe malaria, suggested that associations between pigmented cells and
mortality were moderate to nonexistent in most sites. The predictive ability of
pigmented cells was low, as measured by the change in the area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve of logistic regression models.
CONCLUSIONS: Although high levels of pigmented cells were associated with a fatal
outcome in some study sites, they were not useful predictors of outcome across
Africa.

children in rural Kenya.

BACKGROUND: Malnutrition is common in the developing world and associated with
disease and mortality. Because malnutrition frequently occurs among children in
the community as well as those with acute illness, and because anthropometric
indicators of nutritional status are continuous variables that preclude a single 
definition of malnutrition, malnutrition-attributable fractions of admissions and
deaths cannot be calculated by simply enumerating individual children.
OBJECTIVE: We determined the malnutrition-attributable fractions among children
admitted to a rural district hospital in Kenya, among inpatient deaths and among 
children with the major causes of severe disease.
DESIGN: We analyzed data from children between 6 and 60 mo of age, comprising
13,307 admissions, 674 deaths, 3068 admissions with severe disease, and 562
community controls by logistic regression, using anthropometric z scores as the
independent variable and admission or death as the outcome, to calculate the
probability of admission as a result of "true malnutrition" for individual cases.
Probabilities were averaged to calculate attributable fractions.
RESULTS: Z scores < -3 were insensitive for malnutrition-attributable deaths and 
admissions, and no single threshold was both specific and sensitive. The overall 
malnutrition-attributable fraction for in-hospital deaths was 51% (95% CI: 42%,
61%) with midupper arm circumference. Similar malnutrition-attributable fractions
were seen for the major causes of severe disease (severe malaria,
gastroenteritis, lower respiratory tract infection, HIV, and invasive bacterial
disease).
CONCLUSIONS: Despite global improvements, malnutrition still underlies half of
the inpatient morbidity and mortality rates among children in rural Kenya. This
contribution is underestimated by using conventional clinical definitions of
severe malnutrition.

severe malarial anemia and functional changes in IL-10 production.

Plasmodium falciparum malaria is one of the leading global causes of morbidity
and mortality with African children bearing the highest disease burden. Among the
various severe disease sequelae common to falciparum malaria, severe malarial
anemia (SMA) in pediatric populations accounts for the greatest degree of
mortality. Although the patho-physiological basis of SMA remains unclear,
dysregulation in inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin (IL)-10, appear to
play an important role in determining disease outcomes. Since polymorphic
variability in innate immune response genes conditions susceptibility to malaria,
the relationship between common IL-10 promoter variants (-1,082A/G, -819T/C, and 
-592A/C), SMA (Hb < 6.0 g/dL), and circulating inflammatory mediator levels
(i.e., IL-10, TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-12) were investigated in parasitemic Kenyan 
children (n = 375) in a holoendemic P. falciparum transmission area. Multivariate
logistic regression analyses demonstrated that the -1,082G/-819C/-592C (GCC)
haplotype was associated with protection against SMA (OR; 0.68, 95% CI,
0.43-1.05; P = 0.044) and increased IL-10 production (P = 0.029). Although none
of the other haplotypes were significantly associated with susceptibility to SMA,
individuals with the -1,082A/-819T/-592A (ATA) haplotype had an increased risk of
SMA and reduced circulating IL-10 levels (P = 0.042). Additional results revealed
that the IL-10:TNF-alpha ratio was higher in the GCC group (P = 0.024) and lower 
in individuals with the ATA haplotype (P = 0.034), while the IL-10:IL-12 ratio
was higher in ATA haplotype (P = 0.006). Results presented here demonstrate that 
common IL-10 promoter haplotypes condition susceptibility to SMA and functional
changes in circulating IL-10, TNF-alpha, and IL-12 levels in children with
falciparum malaria.

Does Insecticide Treated Mosquito Nets (ITNs) prevent clinical malaria in
children aged between 6 and 59 months under program setting?

(1)Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Public Health Faculty, Jimma
University, Jimma, Ethiopia. doctoryunis@yahoo.com

Inconsistent use of the mosquito nets and other social and technical factors were
shown to influence efficacy of mosquito nets at field trials. But to date,
experience with local factors influencing effectiveness of ITN programs remain
very limited. The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of ITNs
for preventing clinical malaria in under-five children of Omo Nada Woreda, Jimma 
Zone South West Ethiopia. Matched case-control study was conducted in the
catchments population of Asendabo and Nada health centers, Omo Nada Woreda, South
West Ethiopia on a sample of 273 under-five children. Each case of fever and
parasitemia in a child was paired with two controls. Cases and controls were
compared with regard to ITN ownership and other factors assessed by a pre-coded, 
pre-tested structured questionnaire. Data was analyzed using EPI-INFO version
3.3.2 software. To control the effect of confounding variables, conditional
logistic regression model was used. Sleeping under the mosquito net the night (OR
= 8.28 95% CI: 0.96, 71.1) and the week (OR = 2.41 95% CI: 0.41, 14.0) before the
survey date were strongly, but not significantly associated with clinical
malaria. Mosquito net possession and appropriate utilization of mosquito net were
not associated with clinical malaria. In the comparison of cases with all the
controls rolling out of mosquito net & corrugated iron roof were found to be
independent predictors of clinical malaria. Knowledge about the sign and symptoms
of malaria and its modes of transmission were also independent predictors of
clinical malaria in comparison of cases with health center and community
controls, respectively. With the presence of many programmatic deficiencies like 
poor ITN distribution and re-treatment services, ITNs were not significantly
associated with clinical malaria in under-five children when used during
low-transmission period. Further research using a large sample size is required. 
In line with ITN scale up, information Education Communication (IEC) about the
preventive practices against malaria, causes of malaria, treatment and sign and
symptoms of malaria should be given to the community.

Use of insecticide treated nets by pregnant women and associated factors in a
pre-dominantly rural population in northern Ethiopia.

Belay M(1), Deressa W.

Author information: 
(1)UNICEF Country Office, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the use of insecticide treated nets (ITNs) among pregnant 
women and examine factors associated with its access and use.
METHODS: Community-based cross-sectional study of 815 pregnant women in eight
malarious kebeles in northern Ethiopia based on two-stage cluster design from May
to June 2006. Knowledge on malaria, its cause and preventive measures; treatment 
seeking behaviour; possession and use of ITNs by pregnant women and under-five
children were ascertained through interview and observation. Logistic regression 
was used to determine factors associated with ITNs use.
RESULTS: Knowledge about the cause, transmission and preventive measures of
malaria was relatively good; 90.2% of women associated malaria with mosquito
bites and 94.2% with living near water ponds. Ten per cent reported malaria
illness within the 14 days before the survey, and sought treatment mainly from
public health facilities (56.5%) and community health workers (37.6%). Of 815
households surveyed, 59% owned at least one non-long lasting or long-lasting ITN 
(59.5% rural vs. 54.5% urban; P = 0.401). Lack of access to ITNs (68.3%) and the 
perception that nets could not prevent malaria (27%) were the main reasons for
non-ownership of nets. A total of 58.4% of 481 pregnant women from households
owning at least one ITN had slept under it during the previous night. Fewer rural
(56.7%) than urban women (76.2%) used ITNs (P = 0.001). In 57.6% of households
with at least one ITN, under-five children had used it the night before. Higher
educational attainment was an important predictor of ITNs use (OR = 3.1, 95% CI =
2.1, 4.6).
CONCLUSIONS: Household ownership of ITNs and their use by pregnant women is
promising with the current efforts to scale-up ITNs implementation, but the gap
between ownership and use remains high. Consistent and proper use of nets by
pregnant women should be ensured through information campaigns. Rapid expansion
of access to long lasting ITNs requires that government and NGOs supply them in
adequate numbers.

Little follow-up data on malaria transmission in communities originating from
frontier settlements in Amazonia are available. Here we describe a cohort study
in a frontier settlement in Acre, Brazil, where 509 subjects contributed 489.7
person-years of follow-up. The association between malaria morbidity during the
follow-up and individual, household, and spatial covariates was explored with
mixed-effects logistic regression models and spatial analysis. Incidence rates
for Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum malaria were 30.0/100 and 16.3/100
person-years at risk, respectively. Malaria morbidity was strongly associated
with land clearing and farming, and decreased after five years of residence in
the area, suggesting that clinical immunity develops among subjects exposed to
low malaria endemicity. Significant spatial clustering of malaria was observed in
the areas of most recent occupation, indicating that the continuous influx of
nonimmune settlers to forest-fringe areas perpetuates the cycle of environmental 
change and colonization that favors malaria transmission in rural Amazonia.

BACKGROUND: Malaria control in remote, forested areas of the Mekong region relies
on personal protection from mosquito bites. Uptake of these methods may be
limited by knowledge of the link between mosquitoes and malaria as well as social
and economic aspects. Understanding barriers to uptake will inform malaria
control programmes on targets for improvement of delivery.
METHODS: A total 748 key respondents: health providers and village heads, from
187 villages and 25 different ethnic groups, were interviewed using structured
questionnaires. Differences in use of personal protection, and knowledge of
malaria between groups were analysed using chi-square; and binary logistic
regression used for multivariate analysis.
RESULTS: Malaria knowledge was poor with 19.4% of women and 37.5% of men linking 
mosquitoes with malaria, although 95.6% knew one or more methods of mosquito
control. Virtually all respondents used personal protection at some time during
the year; and understanding of malaria transmission was strongly associated with 
bednet use. Those working in forest agriculture were significantly more likely to
know that mosquitoes transmit malaria but this did not translate into a
significantly greater likelihood of using bednets. Furthermore, use of personal
protection while woing outdoors was rare, and less than 3% of respondents knew
about the insecticide impregnation of bednets. The use of bednets, synthetic
repellents and mosquito coils varied between ethnic groups, but was significantly
more frequent among those with higher income, more years of education and
permanent housing. The reported use of repellents and coils was also more common 
among women despite their low knowledge of malaria transmission, and low
likelihood of having heard information on malaria within the last year.
CONCLUSION: The use of personal protection must be increased, particularly among 
outdoor workers that have higher malaria risk. However, personal protection is
widely used and widely accepted to prevent nuisance biting mosquitoes, with the
major barrier to use being affordability. Therefore, social marketing campaigns
aimed at women and those that work outdoors that provide highly subsidised
products, especially insecticide impregnation kits for bednets and hammock nets
are most likely to succeed in lowering malaria morbidity among non Han-Chinese
groups in rural China.

The factors that identify patients at risk of malaria treatment failure were
evaluated in an area of unstable malaria transmission in eastern Sudan. We
analyzed data from 471 patients who had been enrolled in six previous clinical
antimalarial trials for uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Thirty-four 
(7.3%) had treatment failure (crude). In logistic regression models, an age of < 
or =5 years (odds ratio [OR]=3.7; 95% CI 1.5-8.6; P=0.002) and parasitaemia that 
took 3 days to clear (OR=2.4; 95% CI 1.0-5.9; P=0.04) were found to be predictors
for treatment failure. Presenting temperature (OR=1.4; 95% CI 0.9-2.2; P=0.1),
level of parasitaemia (OR=1.0; 95% CI 1.0-1.0; P=0.8) and presence of gametocytes
(OR=0.3; 95% CI 0.9-1.2; P=0.1) were not associated with treatment failure. Thus,
these factors might be used to identify those in whom treatment might fail in the
future.

INTRODUCTION: Low education levels may limit community-based health worker (CHW) 
efforts in rural Afghanistan. In 2004, LeapFrog Enterprises and the United States
Department of Health and Human Services developed the Afghan Family Health Book
(AFHB), an interactive, electronic picture book, to communicate public health
messages in rural Afghanistan. Changes in health knowledge among households
exposed to the AFHB vs. CHWs were compared.
METHODS: From January-June 2005, baseline and follow-up panel surveys were
administered in Pashto-speaking Laghman and Dari-speaking Kabul provinces. Within
each province, an AFHB and a CHW district were randomly sampled using a
stratified, 2-staged cluster sample design (total 98 clusters and 3,372
households). Surveys tested knowledge of 17 health domains at baseline and on
follow-up at three months. For each domain, multivariate logistic regression was 
used to assess the effect of the AFHB on followup pass rates, controlling for
demographics and differences in baseline knowledge.
RESULTS: Both AFHB and CHW resulted in statistically significant changes in pass 
rates on follow-up, although there were greater gains among AFHB users for five
domains among Pashto-speakers (micronutrients, malaria, sexually transmitted
diseases, postpartum care, and breast-feeding) and seven domains among
Dari-speakers (diet, malaria, mental health, birth-spacing, and
prenatal/neonatal/postpartum care). Community-based health workers effected
greater knowledge gains only for the Dari breast-feeding module. Participants
favored CHW over the AFHB, which they found poorly translated and difficult to
use.
CONCLUSIONS: The AFHB has potential to improve public health knowledge among
rural Afghans. Future efforts may benefit from involvement of local health
agencies and the integration of interactive technology with traditional CHW
approaches.

Variations in the biology and ecology and the high level of genetic polymorphism 
of malaria vectors in Africa highlight the value of mapping their spatial
distribution to enhance successful implementation of integrated vector
management. The objective of this study was to collate data on the relative
frequencies of Anopheles gambiae s.s. and An. arabiensis mosquitoes in Mali, to
assess their association with climate and environmental covariates, and to
produce maps of their spatial distribution. Bayesian geostatistical logistic
regression models were fitted to identify environmental determinants of the
relative frequencies of An. gambiae s.s. and An. arabiensis species and to
produce smooth maps of their geographical distribution. The frequency of An.
arabiensis was positively associated with the normalized difference vegetation
index, the soil water storage index, the maximum temperature and the distance to 
water bodies. It was negatively associated with the minimum temperature and
rainfall. The predicted map suggests that, in West Africa, An. arabiensis is
concentrated in the drier savannah areas, while An. gambiae s.s. prefers the
southern savannah and land along the rivers, particularly the inner delta of
Niger. Because the insecticide knockdown resistance (kdr) gene is reported only
in An. gambiae s.s. in Mali, the maps provide valuable information for vector
control. They may also be useful for planning future implementation of malaria
control by genetically manipulated mosquitoes.

Prevalence of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and haemoglobin S in
high and moderate malaria transmission areas of Muheza, north-eastern Tanzania.

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency and haemoglobin S (HbS) are
very common genetic disorders in sub Saharan Africa, where malaria is endemic.
These genetic disorders have been associated with protection against malaria and 
are therefore under strong selection pressure by the disease. In
November-December 2003, we conducted a cross-sectional survey to determine the
prevalence of G6PD deficiency and HbS in the population and relate these to
malaria infection and haemoglobin levels in lowland and highland areas of
differing malaria transmission patterns of Muheza, Tanzania. Blood samples from
1959 individuals aged 6 months to 45 years were collected. A total of 415 (21%)
and 1181 (60%) samples were analysed for G6PD deficiency and HbS, respectively.
Malarial parasite prevalence was 17.2% (114/1959) in the highlands and 39.6%
(49/1959) in the lowlands. Lowlands had higher prevalence of G6PD deficiency and 
HbS than highlands (G6PD deficiency = 11.32% (24/212) versus 4.43% (9/203), P =
0.01, and HbS = 16.04% (98/611) versus 6.32% (36/570), P = 0.0001). Logistic
regression model showed an association between G6PD deficiency and altitude
[lowlands] (Odds ratio [OR] 3.4, 95% CI = 1.49; 7.90, P = 0.004). In the
lowlands, G6PD deficient individuals had lower mean haemoglobin (10.9g/dl) than
normal ones (12.8g/dl), P = 0.01. These findings show that high malaria
transmission in the lowlands might have selected for G6PD deficiency and HbS.

Comment in
    J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr. 2009 Jun 1;51(2):234-5.

BACKGROUND: To describe episodes of imported malaria in human immunodeficiency
virus type 1-infected patients and to study the risk factors for severe
Plasmodium falciparum malaria.
METHODS: Patients enrolled in the French Hospital Database on HIV who were
diagnosed with a first episode of malaria between 1996 and 2003 were included.
The severity of P. falciparum imported malaria was graded with World Health
Organization criteria. Geographic areas were classified according to P.
falciparum chemoresistance. Risk factors for severe malaria were identified with 
logistic regression.
RESULTS: We studied 190 patients infected by P. falciparum in 178 cases. All but 
four of the patients were infected in sub-Saharan Africa, and half were returning
from a country with a high P. falciparum chloroquine resistance. Their median age
was 37.5 years, and 57% came from a country endemic with malaria. The median CD4 
cell count was 299/mm, and the median plasma human immunodeficiency virus type 1 
RNA load was 4.5 log10 copies/mL. Sixty-five (36.5%) episodes of P. falciparum
malaria were severe. Severe imported malaria was associated with CD4 cells/mm
<350 (odds ratio = 2.58; 95% confidence interval: 1.19 to 5.57). The risk of
severe malaria was lower in patients returning from a country with a high
prevalence of chemoresistance (odds ratio = 0.50; 95% confidence interval: 0.25
to 0.99).
CONCLUSIONS: Severe imported malaria in human immunodeficiency virus type
1-infected patients is associated with decreased CD4 cell count. The risk seems
lower when P. falciparum infection was acquired in areas of high prevalence of
chemoresistance.

OBJECTIVE: To report a study of the signs and symptoms of malarial infection
during pregnancy in an area of stable and intense transmission.
METHODS: As part of a clinical trial, to assess the efficacy and safety of four
antimalarial drug regimens in pregnant women, we collected clinical and
laboratory data from 900 parasitaemic pregnant women and 223 non-parasitaemic
pregnant women who attended an antenatal clinic at a district hospital in Ghana. 
Frequencies of signs and symptoms were calculated and their association with the 
level of parasitaemia was assessed using multivariate logistic regression.
RESULTS: History of fever (7.8%vs. 44.4%; P < 0.0001), headache (12.5%vs. 43.9%; 
P < 0.0001), vomiting (0 vs. 11.5%; P = 0.01), malaise (1.6%vs. 31.6%; P <
0.0001) dizziness (0%vs. 23%; P < 0.0001) and fatigue (0%vs. 22.5%; P < 0.0001)
was substantially higher in parasitaemic primigravidae than in aparasitaemic
primigravid women. Similar differences in the distribution of the symptoms and
signs were observed between parasitaemic and aparasitaemic multigravid women. The
proportion of women with elevated concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase,
alanine aminotransferase and total bilirubin and its fractions was also higher in
parasitaemic than in non-parasitaemic women.
CONCLUSION: In areas of stable malarial transmission, malaria in pregnancy is
often symptomatic. Although the symptoms are mostly non-specific, careful
recording of history may be useful to identify women who need a confirmatory test
and an effective antimalarial treatment.

BACKGROUND: The burden of Plasmodium falciparum malaria has worsened because of
the emergence of chloroquine resistance. Antimalarial drug use and drug pressure 
are critical factors contributing to the selection and spread of resistance. The 
present study explores the geographical, socio-economic and behavioural factors
associated with the use of antimalarial drugs in Africa.
METHODS: The presence of chloroquine (CQ), pyrimethamine (PYR) and other
antimalarial drugs has been evaluated by immuno-capture and high-performance
liquid chromatography in the urine samples of 3,052 children (2-9 y), randomly
drawn in 2003 from the general populations at 30 sites in Senegal (10),
Burkina-Faso (10) and Cameroon (10). Questionnaires have been administered to the
parents of sampled children and to a random sample of households in each site.
The presence of CQ in urine was analysed as dependent variable according to
individual and site characteristics using a random - effect logistic regression
model to take into account the interdependency of observations made within the
same site.
RESULTS: According to the sites, the prevalence rates of CQ and PYR ranged from
9% to 91% and from 0% to 21%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, the
presence of CQ in urine was significantly associated with a history of fever
during the three days preceding urine sampling (OR = 1.22, p = 0.043),
socio-economic level of the population of the sites (OR = 2.74, p = 0.029), age
(2-5 y = reference level; 6-9 y OR = 0.76, p = 0.002), prevalence of
anti-circumsporozoite protein (CSP) antibodies (low prevalence: reference level; 
intermediate level OR = 2.47, p = 0.023), proportion of inhabitants who lived in 
another site one year before (OR = 2.53, p = 0.003), and duration to reach the
nearest tarmacked road (duration less than one hour = reference level, duration
equal to or more than one hour OR = 0.49, p = 0.019).
CONCLUSION: Antimalarial drug pressure varied considerably from one site to
another. It was significantly higher in areas with intermediate malaria
transmission level and in the most accessible sites. Thus, P. falciparum strains 
arriving in cross-road sites or in areas with intermediate malaria transmission
are exposed to higher drug pressure, which could favour the selection and the
spread of drug resistance.

BACKGROUND: Burkitt lymphoma, a childhood cancer common in parts of sub-Saharan
Africa, has been associated with Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) and malaria, but its
association with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is not clear.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We conducted a case-control study of Burkitt
lymphoma among children (aged < or = 15 years) admitted to the pediatric oncology
unit in Blantyre, Malawi between July 2005 and July 2006. Cases were 148 children
diagnosed with Burkitt lymphoma and controls were 104 children admitted with
non-malignant conditions or cancers other than hematological malignancies and
Kaposi sarcoma. Interviews were conducted and serological samples tested for
antibodies against HIV, EBV and malaria. Odds ratios for Burkitt lymphoma were
estimated using unconditional logistic regression adjusting for sex, age, and
residential district. Cases had a mean age of 7.1 years and 60% were male. Cases 
were more likely than controls to be HIV positive (Odds ratio (OR)) = 12.4, 95%
Confidence Interval (CI) 1.3 to 116.2, p = 0.03). ORs for Burkitt lymphoma
increased with increasing antibody titers against EBV (p = 0.001) and malaria (p 
= 0.01). Among HIV negative participants, cases were thirteen times more likely
than controls to have raised levels of both EBV and malaria antibodies (OR =
13.2; 95% CI 3.8 to 46.6; p = 0.001). Reported use of mosquito nets was
associated with a lower risk of Burkitt lymphoma (OR = 0.2, 95% CI, 0.03 to 0.9, 
p = 0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support prior evidence that EBV and malaria act jointly
in the pathogenesis of Burkitt lymphoma, suggesting that malaria prevention may
decrease the risk of Burkitt lymphoma. HIV may also play a role in the etiology
of this childhood tumor.

In the Kivu region located in east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
malnutrition and malaria is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. The
relationship between malaria and malnutrition is unclear and has never been
studied in the Kivu region. This report presents an analysis of data from 5695
children aged 0 to 5 years, admitted to the paediatric ward of Lwiro hospital
between November 1992 and February 2004. The weight/age (W/A) index and
weight/height (W/H) index expressed with standard deviation in relation to the
reference median were calculated (Z score). The association between
protein-energetic malnutrition and malaria infection and nutritional indicators
was measured based on prevalence ratios determined by univariate analysis and
adjusted Odds Ratio (OR) derived using a multivariate model. The prevalence of
malaria at the time of admission was 35.8 % (n=5695). The W/A and W/H indexes and
serum albumin level were correlated with malaria-related morbidity. Logistic
regression showed that high malaria OR was associated with both anthropometric
nutritional indicators [WHZ > -2: OR (CI 95 %) 1.7 (1.4-2.2)] [WAZ > -2: OR (CI
95 %) 1.3 (1.1-1.6)] and biological nutritional indicators [serum albumin > or = 
23 g/L: OR (CI 95 %) 1.6 (1.2-2.1)]. Our findings indicate that malnourished
children at admission have a lower risk of malaria infection.

Plasmodium falciparum infection can lead to deadly complications such as severe
malaria-associated anaemia (SMA) and cerebral malaria (CM). Children with severe 
malaria have elevated levels of circulating immune complexes (ICs). To further
investigate the quantitative differences in antibody class/subclass components of
ICs in SMA and CM, we enrolled 75 children with SMA and 32 children with CM from 
hospitals in western Kenya and matched them to 74 and 52 control children,
respectively, with uncomplicated symptomatic malaria. Total IgG IC levels were
always elevated in children with malaria upon enrollment, but children with CM
had the highest levels of any group. Conditional logistic regression showed a
borderline association between IgG4-containing IC levels and increased risk of
SMA (OR = 3.11, 95% CI 1.01-9.56, P = 0.05). Total IgG ICs (OR = 2.84, 95% CI
1.08-7.46, P = 0.03) and IgE-containing ICs (OR = 6.82, OR 1.88-24.73, P < or =
0.01) were associated with increased risk of CM. These results point to
differences in the contribution of the different antibody class and subclass
components of ICs to the pathogenesis of SMA and CM and give insight into
potential mechanisms of disease.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate barriers preventing pregnant women from using
insecticide-treated nets (ITN) and intermittent presumptive treatment (IPT) with 
sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) 5 years after the launch of the national malaria 
strategy promoting these measures in Kenya.
METHODS: All women aged 15-49 years were interviewed during a community survey in
four districts between December 2006 and January 2007. Women pregnant in the last
12 months were asked about their age, parity, education, use of nets, ITN,
antenatal care (ANC) services and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) (overall and
for IPT) during pregnancy. Homestead assets were recorded and used to develop a
wealth index. Travel time to ANC clinics was computed using a geographic
information system algorithm. Predictors of net and IPT use were defined using
multivariate logistic regression.
RESULTS: Overall 68% of pregnant women used a net; 52% used an ITN; 84% attended 
an ANC clinic at least once and 74% at least twice. Fifty-three percent of women 
took at least one dose of IPT-SP, however only 22% took two or more doses. Women 
from the least poor homesteads (OR = 2.53, 1.36-4.68) and those who used IPT
services (OR = 1.73, 1.24-2.42) were more likely to sleep under any net. Women
who used IPT were more likely to use ITNs (OR = 1.35, 1.03-1.77), while those who
lived more than an hour from an ANC clinic were less likely (OR = 0.61,
0.46-0.81) to use ITN. Women with formal education (1.47, 1.01-2.17) and those
who used ITN (OR: 1.68, 1.20-2.36) were more likely to have received at least one
dose of IPT-SP.
CONCLUSION: Although the use of ITN had increased 10-fold and the use of IPT
fourfold since last measured in 2001, coverage remains low. Provider practices in
the delivery of protective measures against malaria must change, supported by
community awareness campaigns on the importance of mothers' use of IPT.

BACKGROUND: Characterization of severe malaria cases on arrival to hospital may
lead to early recognition and improved management. Minimum community
based-incidence rates (MCBIRs) complement hospital data, describing the malaria
burden in the community.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all admitted malaria cases to a Mozambican
rural hospital between June 2003 and May 2005 was conducted. Prevalence and case 
fatality rates (CFR) for each sign and symptom were calculated. Logistic
regression was used to identify variables which were independent risk factors for
death. MCBIRs for malaria and severe malaria were calculated using data from the 
Demographic Surveillance System.
RESULTS: Almost half of the 8,311 patients admitted during the study period had
malaria and 13,2% had severe malaria. Children under two years accounted for
almost 60% of all malaria cases. CFR for malaria was 1.6% and for severe malaria 
4.4%. Almost 19% of all paediatric hospital deaths were due to malaria.
Prostration (55.0%), respiratory distress (41.1%) and severe anaemia (17.3%) were
the most prevalent signs among severe malaria cases. Severe anaemia and inability
to look for mother's breast were independent risk factors for death in infants
younger than eight months. For children aged eight months to four years, the risk
factors were malnutrition, hypoglycaemia, chest indrawing, inability to sit and a
history of vomiting.MCBIRs for severe malaria cases were highest in children aged
six months to two years of age. MCBIRs for severe malaria per 1,000 child years
at risk for the whole study period were 27 in infants, 23 in children aged 1 to
<5 years and two in children aged > or =5 years.
CONCLUSION: Malaria remains the number one cause of admission in this area of
rural Mozambique, predominantly affecting young children, which are also at
higher risk of dying. Measures envisaged to protect children during their first
two years of life are likely to have a greater impact than at any other age.

BACKGROUND: Although malaria disappeared from southern France more than 60 years 
ago, suspicions of recent autochthonous transmission in the French Mediterranean 
coast support the idea that the area could still be subject to malaria
transmission. The main potential vector of malaria in the Camargue area, the
largest river delta in southern France, is the mosquito Anopheles hyrcanus
(Diptera: Culicidae). In the context of recent climatic and landscape changes,
the evaluation of the risk of emergence or re-emergence of such a major disease
is of great importance in Europe. When assessing the risk of emergence of
vector-borne diseases, it is crucial to be able to characterize the arthropod
vector's spatial distribution. Given that remote sensing techniques can describe 
some of the environmental parameters which drive this distribution, satellite
imagery or aerial photographs could be used for vector mapping.
RESULTS: In this study, we propose a method to map larval and adult populations
of An. hyrcanus based on environmental indices derived from high spatial
resolution imagery. The analysis of the link between entomological field data on 
An. hyrcanus larvae and environmental indices (biotopes, distance to the nearest 
main productive breeding sites of this species i.e., rice fields) led to the
definition of a larval index, defined as the probability of observing An.
hyrcanus larvae in a given site at least once over a year. Independent accuracy
assessments showed a good agreement between observed and predicted values
(sensitivity and specificity of the logistic regression model being 0.76 and
0.78, respectively). An adult index was derived from the larval index by
averaging the larval index within a buffer around the trap location. This index
was highly correlated with observed adult abundance values (Pearson r = 0.97, p <
0.05). This allowed us to generate predictive maps of An. hyrcanus larval and
adult populations from the landscape indices.
CONCLUSION: This work shows that it is possible to use high resolution satellite 
imagery to map malaria vector spatial distribution. It also confirms the
potential of remote sensing to help target risk areas, and constitutes a first
essential step in assessing the risk of re-emergence of malaria in southern
France.

Cerebral malaria (CM) in children is associated with a high mortality and
long-term neurocognitive sequelae. Both erythropoietin (Epo) and vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) have been shown to be neuroprotective. We
hypothesized that high plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of these
cytokines would prevent neurological sequelae in children with CM. We measured
Epo, VEGF, and tumor necrosis factor in paired samples of plasma and CSF of
Kenyan children admitted with CM. Logistic regression models were used to
identify risk and protective factors associated with the development of
neurological sequelae. Children with CM (n = 124) were categorized into three
groups: 76 without sequelae, 32 with sequelae, and 16 who died. Conditional
logistic regression analysis matching the 32 patients with CM and neurological
sequelae to 64 patients with CM without sequelae stratified for hemoglobin level 
estimated that plasma Epo (>200 units/liter) was associated with >80% reduction
in the risk of developing neurological sequelae [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.18;
95% C.I. 0.05-0.93; P = 0.041]. Admission with profound coma (adjusted OR 5.47;
95% C.I. 1.45-20.67; P = 0.012) and convulsions after admission (adjusted OR
16.35; 95% C.I. 2.94-90.79; P = 0.001) were also independently associated with
neurological sequelae. High levels of Epo were associated with reduced risk of
neurological sequelae in children with CM. The age-dependent Epo response to
anemia and the age-dependent protective effect may influence the clinical
epidemiology of CM. These data support further study of Epo as an adjuvant
therapy in CM.

A two-stage cluster survey (n = 200 households) was conducted in the Artibonite
Valley of Haiti during the high malaria transmission season in November-December 
2006. Knowledge, perceptions, and practices related to malaria were obtained from
household representatives using a standardized questionnaire. Blood drops were
obtained on filter paper from all household members more than one month of age (n
= 714). Determinants of malaria infections and correct malaria-related knowledge 
were assessed using logistic regression. Respondents in households with more
assets were significantly more likely than those in households with fewer assets 
to have correct malaria-related knowledge. Respondents from households with at
least one malaria infection were less likely to have correct malaria-related
knowledge. Older children (5-9 years of age) were shown to be at increased risk
of malaria infection. Results suggest malaria control in Haiti should focus on
enhanced surveillance and case management, with expanded information campaigns
about malaria prevention and treatment options.

street, BC 10200 Tu Liem district, Hanoi, Vietnam. thangnimpevn@yahoo.com

BACKGROUND: In Central Vietnam, forest malaria remains difficult to control due
to the complex interactions between human, vector and environmental factors.
METHODS: Prior to a community-based intervention to assess the efficacy of
long-lasting insecticidal hammocks, a complete census (18,646 individuals) and a 
baseline cross-sectional survey for determining malaria prevalence and related
risk factors were carried out. Multivariate analysis using survey logistic
regression was combined to a classification tree model (CART) to better define
the relative importance and inter-relations between the different risk factors.
RESULTS: The study population was mostly from the Ra-glai ethnic group (88%),
with both low education and socio-economic status and engaged mainly in forest
activities (58%). The multivariate analysis confirmed forest activity, bed net
use, ethnicity, age and education as risk factors for malaria infections, but
could not handle multiple interactions. The CART analysis showed that the most
important risk factor for malaria was the wealth category, the wealthiest group
being much less infected (8.9%) than the lower and medium wealth category
(16.6%). In the former, forest activity and bed net use were the most determinant
risk factors for malaria, while in the lower and medium wealth category,
insecticide treated nets were most important, although the latter were less
protective among Ra-glai people.
CONCLUSION: The combination of CART and multivariate analysis constitute a novel 
analytical approach, providing an accurate and dynamic picture of the main risk
factors for malaria infection. Results show that the control of forest malaria
remains an extremely complex task that has to address poverty-related risk
factors such as education, ethnicity and housing conditions.

BACKGROUND: Individuals living in malaria endemic areas generally harbour
multiple parasite strains. Multiplicity of infection (MOI) can be an indicator of
immune status. However, whether this is good or bad for the development of
immunity to malaria, is still a matter of debate. This study aimed to examine the
MOI in asymptomatic children between two and ten years of age and to relate it to
erythrocyte variants, clinical attacks, transmission levels and other
parasitological indexes.
METHODS: Study took place in Niakhar area in Senegal, where malaria is
mesoendemic and seasonal. Three hundred and seventy two asymptomatic children
were included. Sickle-cell trait, G6PD deficiency (A- and Santamaria) and
alpha+-thalassaemia (-alpha3.7 type) were determined using PCR. Multiplicity of
Plasmodium falciparum infection, i.e. number of concurrent clones, was defined by
PCR-based genotyping of the merozoite surface protein-2 (msp2), before and at the
end of the malaria transmission season. The chi2-test, ANOVA, multivariate linear
regression and logistic regression statistical tests were used for data analysis.
RESULTS: MOI was significantly higher at the end of transmission season. The
majority of PCR positive subjects had multiple infections at both time points
(64% before and 87% after the transmission season). MOI did not increase in
alpha-thalassaemic and G6PD mutated children. The ABO system and HbAS did not
affect MOI at any time points. No association between MOI and clinical attack was
observed. MOI did not vary over age at any time points. There was a significant
correlation between MOI and parasite density, as the higher parasite counts
increases the probability of having multiple infections.
CONCLUSION: Taken together our data revealed that alpha-thalassaemia may have a
role in protection against certain parasite strains. The protection against the
increase in MOI after the transmission season conferred by G6PD deficiency is
probably due to clearance of the malaria parasite at early stages of infection.
The ABO system and HbAS are involved in the severity of the disease but do not
affect asymptomatic infections. MOI was not age-dependent, in the range of two to
ten years, but was correlated with parasite density. However some of these
observations need to be confirmed including larger sample size with broader age
range and using other msp2 genotyping method.

BACKGROUND: In East Africa, visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is endemic in parts of
Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya and Uganda. It is caused by Leishmania donovani
and transmitted by the sandfly vector Phlebotomus martini. In the Pokot focus,
reaching from western Kenya into eastern Uganda, formulation of a prevention
strategy has been hindered by the lack of knowledge on VL risk factors as well as
by lack of support from health sector donors. The present study was conducted to 
establish the necessary evidence-base and to stimulate interest in supporting the
control of this neglected tropical disease in Uganda and Kenya.
METHODS: A case-control study was carried out from June to December 2006. Cases
were recruited at Amudat hospital, Nakapiripirit district, Uganda, after clinical
and parasitological confirmation of symptomatic VL infection. Controls were
individuals that tested negative using a rK39 antigen-based dipstick, which were 
recruited at random from the same communities as the cases. Data were analysed
using conditional logistic regression.
RESULTS: Ninety-three cases and 226 controls were recruited into the study.
Multivariate analysis identified low socio-economic status and treating livestock
with insecticide as risk factors for VL. Sleeping near animals, owning a mosquito
net and knowing about VL symptoms were associated with a reduced risk of VL.
CONCLUSIONS: VL affects the poorest of the poor of the Pokot tribe. Distribution 
of insecticide-treated mosquito nets combined with dissemination of culturally
appropriate behaviour-change education is likely to be an effective prevention
strategy.

BACKGROUND: The population exposed to malaria within African cities has steadily 
increased. However, comprehensive data on life-threatening malaria features and
risk factors in children from urban areas with seasonal malaria transmission,
such as in Bamako (Mali), are lacking.
METHODS: Children admitted to the Gabriel Touré Hospital in Bamako with severe
malarial anemia (SMA) and/or cerebral malaria (CM) were prospectively included in
the study. Indicators of either SMA or CM were analyzed using logistic
regression; and death hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated through survival
analysis.
RESULTS: The study included 455 children: 66% presented with CM, 34% with SMA, 3%
with hypoglycemia (HG); 5% with dehydration; 17% with respiratory distress (RD); 
25% with splenomegaly; and 92% with hepatomegaly. The children with CM were older
than those with SMA. CM was more often associated with dehydration, HG, and RD,
whereas SMA was more often associated with splenomegaly. The overall case
fatality rate was 16%, and 94% of the children who died had CM. HG [HR: 2.37; 95%
confidence interval (CI): 1.04-5.39; P = 0.040], RD (HR: 4.23; 95% CI: 2.46-7.30;
P < 10(-6)) and a deep coma with a Blantyre score of less than 3 (HR: 6.78, 95%
CI: 2.43-18.91; P < 10(-3)), were all independent predictors of death.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings delineate the patterns of severe malaria in children 
in a West African mesoendemic urban setting. They validate practicable prognostic
indicators of life-threatening malaria for use in the limited facilities
available in African health centers and provide a frame of reference for further 
research addressing life-threatening malaria in this setting.

Hill, North Carolina 27599-7596, USA. cengmann@med.unc.edu

OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence and identify risk factors for iron
deficiency and anemia in pregnant Ghanaian women from urban areas.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 452 healthy pregnant women receiving prenatal
care in Accra, Ghana, was conducted. A sociodemographic health questionnaire was 
performed and hematologic parameters were measured. Logistic regression methods
were used to identify risk factors for anemia and iron status.
RESULTS: Complete data were available for 428 women. Anemia (hemoglobin <11 g/dL)
was present in 144 (34%), iron deficiency (ferritin < or =16 microg/L) in 69
(16%), and iron deficiency anemia in 32 (7.5%) women. The adjusted odds ratio
(OR) for anemia was 3.4 and 9.8 if iron deficiency and malaria parasitemia were
present, respectively; the OR was 0.6 if women were at > or =36 weeks of
pregnancy. The adjusted OR for iron deficiency was 2.7 if women were at > or =36 
weeks of pregnancy and 0.12 if they had sickle trait.
CONCLUSION: Although anemia and iron deficiency remain substantial problems in
pregnant Ghanaian women from urban areas, their prevalence is less than
previously reported.

BACKGROUND: HIV is associated with an increased incidence of malaria in adult
African populations. In children, the relationship between HIV and malaria is
less clear. We investigated the relationship between malaria and HIV-1 infection 
among adults and children referred for malaria blood smears at government health 
clinics in Uganda.
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study in which 1000 consecutive patients
referred for malaria blood smears over the course of 1 to 2 months at each of 7
government clinics (N = 7000) were tested for HIV-1 from dried blood spots using 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) screening and nucleic acid-based
confirmatory testing. Risk factors for HIV-1 infection were identified using
multivariate logistic regression.
RESULTS: Among 4467 children aged 16 years or younger, 77 (1.7%) were HIV-1
infected. Of 2533 adults, 270 (10.7%) were HIV-1 infected. In children, having a 
negative malaria blood smear was associated with higher odds of HIV-1 infection
(odds ratio [OR] = 1.90, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.18 to 3.06) after
controlling for age and gender. In adults, having a positive malaria blood smear 
was moderately associated with higher odds of HIV-1 infection (OR = 1.41, 95% CI:
1.01 to 1.97) after controlling for age and gender.
CONCLUSIONS: In Ugandans evaluated for suspected malaria, associations between
malaria smear results and HIV infection differed between children and adults.
Although further operations research is needed, our results suggest that
counseling and testing for HIV may be of particular importance in children
suspected of malaria but with negative malaria smears and in adults with positive
malaria smears.

Motor activity improves cognitive and social-emotional development through a
child's exploration of his or her physical and social environment. This study
assessed anemia, iron deficiency, hemoglobin (Hb), length-for-age Z-score (LAZ), 
and malaria infection as predictors of motor activity in 771 children aged 5-19
mo. Trained observers conducted 2- to 4-h observations of children's motor
activity in and around their homes. Binary logistic regression assessed the
predictors of any locomotion. Children who did not locomote during the
observation (nonmovers) were excluded from further analyses. Linear regression
evaluated the predictors of total motor activity (TMA) and time spent in
locomotion for all children who locomoted during the observation combined
(movers) and then separately for crawlers and walkers. Iron deficiency (77.0%),
anemia (58.9%), malaria infection (33.9%), and stunting (34.6%) were prevalent.
Iron deficiency with and without anemia, Hb, LAZ, and malaria infection
significantly predicted TMA and locomotion in all movers. Malaria infection
significantly predicted less TMA and locomotion in crawlers. In walkers, iron
deficiency anemia predicted less activity and locomotion, whereas higher Hb and
LAZ significantly predicted more activity and locomotion, even after controlling 
for attained milestone. Improvements in iron status and growth and prevention or 
effective treatment of malaria may improve children's motor, cognitive, and
social-emotional development either directly or through improvements in motor
activity. However, the relative importance of these factors is dependent on motor
development, with malaria being important for the younger, less developmentally
advanced children and Hb and LAZ becoming important as children begin to attain
walking skills.

Burkitt lymphoma, a childhood tumor common in parts of sub-Saharan Africa, has
been directly associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and indirectly with
prevalence of malaria. We studied antibodies to both EBV and malaria in children 
diagnosed with this cancer in Uganda. We performed a case-control study of
HIV-seronegative children (<or=15 years) admitted to hospital. Cases were
diagnosed with Burkitt lymphoma and controls with non-malignant conditions or
non-lymphatic cancers. Interviews were conducted and serological samples
collected and, when possible, tested for both EBV and malaria. Adjusted odds
ratios (ORs) for Burkitt lymphoma were estimated using unconditional logistic
regression adjusting for sex, age, residential district, household income and
tribe. The mean age of cases was 7 years and 61% were male. Compared to controls,
cases were more likely to be reported having received more frequent treatment for
malaria in the past year (OR = 2.0; p = 0.001) and less likely to be living in a 
home where insecticides were used (OR = 0.2; p < 0.0001). Odds ratios for Burkitt
lymphoma in children increased with increasing antibody levels against EBV (p <
0.0001) and malaria (p = 0.05). Findings were similar for children residing in
districts close to the capital city and in remote areas. Cases were 5 times more 
likely than controls to have raised levels of both EBV and malaria antibodies (OR
= 5.0; p = 0.003). Our findings suggest that EBV and malaria may act
synergistically in the pathogenesis of childhood Burkitt lymphoma. Malaria
prevention measures may also prevent this childhood cancer.

BACKGROUND: The Roll Back Malaria strategy recommends a combination of
interventions for malaria control. Zanzibar implemented artemisinin-based
combination therapy (ACT) for uncomplicated malaria in late 2003 and long-lasting
insecticidal nets (LLINs) from early 2006. ACT is provided free of charge to all 
malaria patients, while LLINs are distributed free to children under age 5 y
("under five") and pregnant women. We investigated temporal trends in Plasmodium 
falciparum prevalence and malaria-related health parameters following the
implementation of these two malaria control interventions in Zanzibar.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Cross-sectional clinical and parasitological surveys in
children under the age of 14 y were conducted in North A District in May 2003,
2005, and 2006. Survey data were analyzed in a logistic regression model and
adjusted for complex sampling design and potential confounders. Records from all 
13 public health facilities in North A District were analyzed for malaria-related
outpatient visits and admissions. Mortality and demographic data were obtained
from District Commissioner's Office. P. falciparum prevalence decreased in
children under five between 2003 and 2006; using 2003 as the reference year, odds
ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were, for 2005, 0.55 (0.28-1.08),
and for 2006, 0.03 (0.00-0.27); p for trend < 0.001. Between 2002 and 2005 crude 
under-five, infant (under age 1 y), and child (aged 1-4 y) mortality decreased by
52%, 33%, and 71%, respectively. Similarly, malaria-related admissions, blood
transfusions, and malaria-attributed mortality decreased significantly by 77%,
67% and 75%, respectively, between 2002 and 2005 in children under five. Climatic
conditions favorable for malaria transmission persisted throughout the
observational period.
CONCLUSIONS: Following deployment of ACT in Zanzibar 2003, malaria-associated
morbidity and mortality decreased dramatically within two years. Additional
distribution of LLINs in early 2006 resulted in a 10-fold reduction of malaria
parasite prevalence. The results indicate that the Millennium Development Goals
of reducing mortality in children under five and alleviating the burden of
malaria are achievable in tropical Africa with high coverage of combined malaria 
control interventions.

In clinical trials, the specificity of the disease endpoint is critical to an
accurate estimate of vaccine efficacy. We used a logistic regression model to
analyse parasite densities among children before and after treatment with
antimalarials, in order to estimate the impact that clearing asymptomatic
parasitaemia had on the specificity of the endpoint of febrile malaria. The
malaria attributable fever fraction was higher after antimalarial treatment (i.e.
fever and parasitaemia were more likely to be causally related), implying that
drug treatment prior to monitoring decreased the misclassification of febrile
malaria. In intervention studies with febrile malaria as an endpoint, clearing
asymptomatic parasitaemia increases the study's power more effectively than
raising the threshold parasitaemia.

Landscape factors influencing the spatial distribution and abundance of mosquito 
vector Culex quinquefasciatus (Diptera: Culicidae) in a mixed

Mosquito-borne avian diseases, principally avian malaria (Plasmodium relictum
Grassi and Feletti) and avian pox (Avipoxvirus sp.) have been implicated as the
key limiting factor associated with recent declines of endemic avifauna in the
Hawaiian Island archipelago. We present data on the relative abundance, infection
status, and spatial distribution of the primary mosquito vector Culex
quinquefasciatus Say (Diptera: Culicidae) across a mixed,
residential-agricultural community adjacent to Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park on
Hawai'i Island. We modeled the effect of agriculture and forest fragmentation in 
determining relative abundance of adult Cx. quinquefasciatus in Volcano Village, 
and we implement our statistical model in a geographic information system to
generate a probability of mosquito capture prediction surface for the study area.
Our model was based on biweekly captures of adult mosquitoes from 20 locations
within Volcano Village from October 2001 to April 2003. We used mixed effects
logistic regression to model the probability of capturing a mosquito, and we
developed a set of 17 competing models a priori to specifically evaluate the
effect of agriculture and fragmentation (i.e., residential landscapes) at two
spatial scales. In total, 2,126 mosquitoes were captured in CO2-baited traps with
an average probability of 0.27 (SE = 0.10) of capturing one or more mosquitoes
per trap night. Twelve percent of mosquitoes captured were infected with P.
relictum. Our data indicate that agricultural lands and forest fragmentation
significantly increase the probability of mosquito capture. The prediction
surface identified areas along the Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park boundary that 
may have high relative abundance of the vector. Our data document the potential
of avian malaria transmission in residential-agricultural landscapes and support 
the need for vector management that extends beyond reserve boundaries and
considers a reserve's spatial position in a highly heterogeneous landscape.

Predictors of knowledge about malaria in India.

Author information:

Delhi, India. arsharma62@gmail.com

BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Reduction of malarial morbidity and mortality is
important to meet the overall objectives of reducing poverty and has been
included in the Millennium Development Goals. To achieve these targets it is
imperative to have active community participation to control malaria. Community
participation in turn depends on people's knowledge and attitude towards the
disease. This study was conducted to examine the factors that predict the
knowledge of Indian population regarding malaria. A questionnaire based
cross-sectional survey was conducted for data collection.
RESULTS: Data were collected from 15,750 adult respondents using a pre-tested
questionnaire representing urban, rural, tribal and slum population from 21
states. Knowledge about various aspects of malaria was tested using a structured 
questionnaire. Logistic regression analysis was applied to determine predictors
of knowledge about etiology, clinical features, mode of transmission, prevention 
and control.
INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Common predictors of correct knowledge about
etiology and clinical features of malaria were male sex and college education.
Female sex, illiteracy and tribal population were more likely to have been
associated with wrong beliefs about fatality of malaria. Being tribal respondent 
was the single most important predictor of inadequate knowledge. Similarly, use
of smoke for killing of adult mosquito was predicted by rural or slum residence
and illiteracy. All findings were based on logistic regression analysis.
Geographical variations also influenced knowledge about malaria. It may be
inferred that improvement in knowledge, attitude and practices related to malaria
may be attained only after looking at its predictors at micro level. However, a
strategic framework at national level is certainly needed to provide directions
at local level.

Developing a spatial-statistical model and map of historical malaria prevalence
in Botswana using a staged variable selection procedure.

BACKGROUND: Several malaria risk maps have been developed in recent years, many
from the prevalence of infection data collated by the MARA (Mapping Malaria Risk 
in Africa) project, and using various environmental data sets as predictors.
Variable selection is a major obstacle due to analytical problems caused by
over-fitting, confounding and non-independence in the data. Testing and comparing
every combination of explanatory variables in a Bayesian spatial framework
remains unfeasible for most researchers. The aim of this study was to develop a
malaria risk map using a systematic and practicable variable selection process
for spatial analysis and mapping of historical malaria risk in Botswana.
RESULTS: Of 50 potential explanatory variables from eight environmental data
themes, 42 were significantly associated with malaria prevalence in univariate
logistic regression and were ranked by the Akaike Information Criterion. Those
correlated with higher-ranking relatives of the same environmental theme, were
temporarily excluded. The remaining 14 candidates were ranked by selection
frequency after running automated step-wise selection procedures on 1000
bootstrap samples drawn from the data. A non-spatial multiple-variable model was 
developed through step-wise inclusion in order of selection frequency. Previously
excluded variables were then re-evaluated for inclusion, using further step-wise 
bootstrap procedures, resulting in the exclusion of another variable. Finally a
Bayesian geo-statistical model using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation was
fitted to the data, resulting in a final model of three predictor variables,
namely summer rainfall, mean annual temperature and altitude. Each was
independently and significantly associated with malaria prevalence after allowing
for spatial correlation. This model was used to predict malaria prevalence at
unobserved locations, producing a smooth risk map for the whole country.
CONCLUSION: We have produced a highly plausible and parsimonious model of
historical malaria risk for Botswana from point-referenced data from a 1961/2
prevalence survey of malaria infection in 1-14 year old children. After starting 
with a list of 50 potential variables we ended with three highly plausible
predictors, by applying a systematic and repeatable staged variable selection
procedure that included a spatial analysis, which has application for other
environmentally determined infectious diseases. All this was accomplished using
general-purpose statistical software.

Malaria infection during pregnancy (MiP) is heterogeneously distributed even in
malaria-endemic countries. Program planners require data to facilitate
identification of highest-priority populations for MiP control. Using data from
two cross-sectional studies of 5,528 pregnant women in 8 neighboring sites in
Mozambique, we described factors associated with maternal peripheral parasitemia 
by using logistic regression. Principal multivariate predictors of maternal
peripheral parasitemia were gravidity (odds ratio [OR] = 2.29, 95% confidence
interval [CI] = 1.60-3.26 for primigravidae and OR = 1.61, 95% CI = 1.29-2.01 for
secundigravidae compared with gravidity > or = 3); age (OR = 0.96 per year, 95%
CI = 0.94-0.99); study site (OR = 1.45, 95% CI = 1.34-1.56 to 5.32, 95% CI =
4.92-5.75) for comparison with the reference site; and no maternal education (OR 
= 1.38, 95% CI = 1.15-1.66) compared with any education. Other predictors (in
subgroups) were bed net use (OR = 0.49, 95% CI = 0.48-0.50); preventive
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine doses (OR = 0.25, 95% CI = 0.24-0.25); and infection
with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (OR = 1.49, 95% CI = 1.11-2.00).
Programmatic priorities should respond to heterogeneous distribution of multiple 
risk factors, including prevalence of malaria and infection with HIV, and
maternal socioeconomic status.

The focus of this article is on the determinants of workplace violence against
health workers identified in two cross-sectional analytical studies. The
prevalence of victims of the several types and of any-type of workplace violence 
was estimated in each study, as well as the relative frequency of the associated 
characteristics. Each dependent variable was also analyzed, in relation to the
dichotomized independent variables using a stepwise logistic regression strategy.
The Ministry of Health has adopted strategies, which include guidelines on what
to do to prevent and correct violence against health workers and a workplace
violence observatory. Workplace violence has societal, organizational and
individual determinants that can be prevented and monitored.

BACKGROUND: Co-morbidity with conditions such as fever, diarrhoea and pneumonia
is a common phenomenon in tropical Africa. However, little is known about
geographical overlaps in these illnesses. Spatial modelling may improve our
understanding of the epidemiology of the diseases for efficient and
cost-effective control.
METHODS: This study assessed subdistrict-specific spatial associations of the
three conditions (fever, diarrhoea and pneumonia) in relation to malaria
endemicity. We used data from the 2000 Malawi demographic and health survey which
captured the history of childhood morbidities 2 weeks prior to the survey date.
The disease status of each child in each area was the outcome of interest and was
modelled using a trivariate logistic regression model, and incorporated random
effects to measure spatial correlation.
RESULTS: The risk of fever was positively associated with high and medium malaria
endemicity levels relative to low endemicity level, while for diarrhoea and
pneumonia we observed marginal positive association at high endemicity level
relative to low endemicity level, controlling for confounding covariates and
heterogeneity. A positive spatial correlation was found between fever and
diarrhoea (r = 0.29); while weak associations were estimated between fever and
pneumonia (r = 0.01); and between diarrhoea and pneumonia (r = 0.05). The
proportion of structured spatial variation compared to unstructured variation was
0.67 (95% credible interval (CI): 0.31-0.91) for fever, 0.67 (95 % CI: 0.27-0.93)
for diarrhoea, and 0.87 (95% CI: 0.62-0.96) for pneumonia.
CONCLUSION: The analysis suggests some similarities in subdistrict-specific
spatial variation of childhood morbidities of fever, diarrhoea and pneumonia, and
might be a result of shared and overlapping risk factors, one of which is malaria
endemicity.

The study aimed to characterize the population pharmacokinetics of amodiaquine
(AQ) and its major metabolite N-desethylamodiaquine (N-DEAQ), and to assess the
correlation between exposure to N-DEAQ and treatment outcome. Blood samples from 
children in two studies in Zanzibar and one in Papua New Guinea were included in 
the pharmacokinetic analysis (n = 86). The children had been treated with AQ in
combination with artesunate or sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine. The population
pharmacokinetics of AQ and N-DEAQ were modeled using the non-linear mixed effects
approach as implemented in NONMEM. Bayesian post-hoc estimates of individual
pharmacokinetic parameters were used to generate individual profiles of N-DEAQ
exposure. The correlation between N-DEAQ exposure and effect was studied in 212
patients and modeled with logistic regression in NONMEM. The pharmacokinetics of 
AQ and N-DEAQ were best described by two parallel two-compartment models with a
central and a peripheral compartment for each compound. The systemic exposure to 
AQ was low in comparison to N-DEAQ. The t(1/2 lambda) of N-DEAQ ranged from 3
days to 12 days. There was a statistically significant, yet weak, association
between N-DEAQ concentration on day 7 and treatment outcome. The age-based dosing
schedule currently recommended in Zanzibar appeared to result in inadequate
exposure to N-DEAQ in many patients.

BACKGROUND: The 2 most common hemoglobinopathies, sickle cell trait and alpha
(+)-thalassemia, confer partial resistance to fatal forms of malaria, but the
molecular basis for this protection is still not understood. Examination of the
relationship between these traits and malaria transmission intensity may provide 
insights into the protection afforded.
METHODS: The distribution of the 2 traits was assessed among children resident in
13 villages in the Eastern Arc Mountains in Tanzania, where Plasmodium falciparum
transmission intensity is closely correlated with altitude. Associations between 
the prevalence of the 2 traits and malariometric indices were investigated by
logistic regression. Short tandem repeat (STR) microsatellite allele frequencies 
were used to assess population substructuring.
RESULTS: The frequency of alpha (+)-thalassemia ranged from 10%-25% in
high-altitude villages (>1200 m) to 45%-55% in low-altitude villages (<600 m).
The carriage rate of alpha (+)-thalassemia decreased by approximately 12% per
100-m increase in altitude (P<.001) and was approximately 50% lower among those
with patent parasitemia than among uninfected individuals (P=.014). The
prevalence of the sickle cell trait was lower than that of alpha (+)-thalassemia 
(range, 0%-14%) and was significantly associated with village altitude only
(P=.011). STR allele frequencies were similar in all villages.
CONCLUSIONS: In this malaria-endemic region of Tanzania, alpha (+)-thalassemia is
common and clearly associated with P. falciparum transmission intensity. There
was no evidence of population substructuring, and the results are suggestive of
selection of the alpha (3.7) allele by malaria.

OBJECTIVE: To identify individual risk factors for malaria infection of
inhabitants in the residual transmission focus on the Pacific coast of Oaxaca,
Mexico.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A population-based, matched case-control study was
conducted from January 2002 to July 2003 comparing the frequency of exposure to
individual risk factors in subjects presenting clinical malaria and uninfected
controls. A malaria case was defined as an individual living in the study area
presenting malaria symptoms and a Plasmodium vivax-positive thick blood smear;
controls were individuals negative to P. vivax parasites and antibodies of the
same gender and with +/- five years as the case. A standardized questionnaire was
used to record information about the individual risk factors associated with
malaria episodes in cases and two controls for each case.
RESULTS: In a multiple conditional logistic regression model analysis of data
from 119 cases and 238 controls, 18 out of 99 variables were significantly
associated (p< 0.05) with increased risk of malaria, including: being born in
another locality (RM 3.16, 95% IC 1.16-6.13); speaking only an autochthonous
language (RM= 2.48, 95% IC 1.19-3.77); having poor knowledge about malaria (RM=
2.26 95% IC 1.10-4.66 P< 0.02); the amount of vegetation around the house (RM=
20.43, 95% IC 5.98-70.87, P< 0.000; RM= 3.78, 95% IC 1.21-11.80, for 60-100% and 
30-59%, respectively); living in houses constructed with perishable materials
(RM= 2.85, 95% IC 1.62-5.01); living on the periphery of the town (RM= 6.23, 95% 
IC 3.50-11.0); sleeping on a dirt floor (RM= 2.98, 95% IC 1.78-5.01) or with two 
or more people in the same bed (RM= 1.85, 95% CI 1.09-3.14); not using bed nets
(RM= 2.39, 95% IC 1.18-4.83, P< 0.003) or using bed nets with holes (RM= 13.93,
95 IC 2.48-78.01); traveling outside of the village (RM= 9.16, 95% IC 1.98-42.2);
and previous malaria cases in the house (RM= 5.84, 95% IC 3.33-10.22).
CONCLUSIONS: Risk of malaria infection was associated with socio-cultural and
environmental factors exposing individuals to mosquito bites. A higher risk of
malaria infection occurred outside the locality and by intradomiciliar
transmission probably as a result of relapsing asymptomatic relatives.

Effect of meteorological factors on clinical malaria risk among children: an
assessment using village-based meteorological stations and community-based
parasitological survey.

BACKGROUND: Temperature, rainfall and humidity have been widely associated with
the dynamics of malaria vector population and, therefore, with spread of the
disease. However, at the local scale, there is a lack of a systematic
quantification of the effect of these factors on malaria transmission. Further,
most attempts to quantify this effect are based on proxy meteorological data
acquired from satellites or interpolated from a different scale. This has led to 
controversies about the contribution of climate change to malaria transmission
risk among others. Our study addresses the original question of relating
meteorological factors measured at the local scale with malaria infection, using 
data collected at the same time and scale.
METHODS: 676 children (6-59 months) were selected randomly from three
ecologically different sites (urban and rural). During weekly home visits between
December 1, 2003, and November 30, 2004, fieldworkers tested children with fever 
for clinical malaria. They also collected data on possible confounders monthly.
Digital meteorological stations measured ambient temperature, humidity, and
rainfall in each site. Logistic regression was used to estimate the risk of
clinical malaria given the previous month's meteorological conditions.
RESULTS: The overall incidence of clinical malaria over the study period was 1.07
episodes per child. Meteorological factors were associated with clinical malaria 
with mean temperature having the largest effect.
CONCLUSION: Temperature was the best predictor for clinical malaria among
children under five. A systematic measurement of local temperature through ground
stations and integration of such data in the routine health information system
could support assessment of malaria transmission risk at the district level for
well-targeted control efforts.

Plasmodium falciparum malaria is a serious health hazard for travelers to
malaria-endemic areas and is often diagnosed on return to the country of
residence. We conducted a retrospective study of imported falciparum malaria
among travelers returning to France from malaria-endemic areas from 1996 through 
2003. Epidemiologic, clinical, and parasitologic data were collected by a network
of 120 laboratories. Factors associated with fatal malaria were identified by
logistic regression analysis. During the study period, 21,888 falciparum malaria 
cases were reported. There were 96 deaths, for a case-fatality rate of 4.4 per
1,000 cases of falciparum malaria. In multivariate analysis, risk factors
independently associated with death from imported malaria were older age,
European origin, travel to East Africa, and absence of chemoprophylaxis. Fatal
imported malaria remains rare and preventable. Pretravel advice and malaria
management should take into account these risk factors, particularly for senior
travelers.

BACKGROUND: We examined algorithms for malaria mapping using the impact of
reflectance calibration uncertainties on the accuracies of three vegetation
indices (VI)'s derived from QuickBird data in three rice agro-village complexes
Mwea, Kenya. We also generated inferential statistics from field sampled
vegetation covariates for identifying riceland Anopheles arabiensis during the
crop season. All aquatic habitats in the study sites were stratified based on
levels of rice stages; flooded, land preparation, post-transplanting, tillering, 
flowering/maturation and post-harvest/fallow. A set of uncertainty propagation
equations were designed to model the propagation of calibration uncertainties
using the red channel (band 3: 0.63 to 0.69 microm) and the near infra-red (NIR) 
channel (band 4: 0.76 to 0.90 microm) to generate the Normalized Difference
Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI). The
Atmospheric Resistant Vegetation Index (ARVI) was also evaluated incorporating
the QuickBird blue band (Band 1: 0.45 to 0.52 microm) to normalize atmospheric
effects. In order to determine local clustering of riceland habitats Gi*(d)
statistics were generated from the ground-based and remotely-sensed ecological
databases. Additionally, all riceland habitats were visually examined using the
spectral reflectance of vegetation land cover for identification of highly
productive riceland Anopheles oviposition sites.
RESULTS: The resultant VI uncertainties did not vary from surface reflectance or 
atmospheric conditions. Logistic regression analyses of all field sampled
covariates revealed emergent vegetation was negatively associated with mosquito
larvae at the three study sites. In addition, floating vegetation (-ve) was
significantly associated with immature mosquitoes in Rurumi and Kiuria (-ve);
while, turbidity was also important in Kiuria. All spatial models exhibit
positive autocorrelation; similar numbers of log-counts tend to cluster in
geographic space. The spectral reflectance from riceland habitats, examined using
the remote and field stratification, revealed post-transplanting and tillering
rice stages were most frequently associated with high larval abundance and
distribution.
CONCLUSION: NDVI, SAVI and ARVI generated from QuickBird data and field sampled
vegetation covariates modeled cannot identify highly productive riceland An.
arabiensis aquatic habitats. However, combining spectral reflectance of riceland 
habitats from QuickBird and field sampled data can develop and implement an
Integrated Vector Management (IVM) program based on larval productivity.

BACKGROUND: Because of the belief that Nairobi is a low risk zone for malaria,
little empirical data exists on malaria risk in the area. The aim of this study
was to explore the risk of perceived malaria and some associated factors in
Nairobi informal settlements using self-reported morbidity survey.
METHODS: The survey was conducted from May to August 2004 on 7,288 individuals in
two informal settlements of Nairobi. Participants were asked to report illnesses 
they experienced in the past 14 days. Logistic regression was used to estimate
the odds of perceived-malaria. The model included variables such as site of
residence, age, ethnicity and number of reported symptoms.
RESULTS: Participants reported 165 illnesses among which malaria was the leading 
cause (28.1%). The risk of perceived-malaria was significantly higher in
Viwandani compared to Korogocho (OR 1.61, 95%CI: 1.10-2.26). Participants in age 
group 25-39 years had significantly higher odds of perceived-malaria compared to 
those under-five years (OR 2.07, 95%CI: 1.43-2.98). The Kikuyu had reduced odds
of perceived-malaria compared to other ethnic groups. Individuals with five and
more symptoms had higher odds compared to those with no symptoms (OR 23.69,
95%CI: 12.98-43.23).
CONCLUSION: Malaria was the leading cause of illness as perceived by the
residents in the two informal settlements. This was rational as the number of
reported symptoms was highly associated with the risk of reporting the illness.
These results highlight the need for a more comprehensive assessment of malaria
epidemiology in Nairobi to be able to offer evidence-based guidance to policy on 
malaria in Kenya and particularly in Nairobi.

BACKGROUND: Bloodstream infection is a common cause of hospitalization, morbidity
and death in children. The impact of antimicrobial resistance and HIV infection
on outcome is not firmly established.
METHODS: We assessed the incidence of bloodstream infection and risk factors for 
fatal outcome in a prospective cohort study of 1828 consecutive admissions of
children aged zero to seven years with signs of systemic infection. Blood was
obtained for culture, malaria microscopy, HIV antibody test and, when necessary, 
HIV PCR. We recorded data on clinical features, underlying diseases,
antimicrobial drug use and patients' outcome.
RESULTS: The incidence of laboratory-confirmed bloodstream infection was 13.9%
(255/1828) of admissions, despite two thirds of the study population having
received antimicrobial therapy prior to blood culture. The most frequent isolates
were klebsiella, salmonellae, Escherichia coli, enterococci and Staphylococcus
aureus. Furthermore, 21.6% had malaria and 16.8% HIV infection. One third (34.9%)
of the children with laboratory-confirmed bloodstream infection died. The
mortality rate from Gram-negative bloodstream infection (43.5%) was more than
double that of malaria (20.2%) and Gram-positive bloodstream infection (16.7%).
Significant risk factors for death by logistic regression modeling were
inappropriate treatment due to antimicrobial resistance, HIV infection, other
underlying infectious diseases, malnutrition and bloodstream infection caused by 
Enterobacteriaceae, other Gram-negatives and candida.
CONCLUSION: Bloodstream infection was less common than malaria, but caused more
deaths. The frequent use of antimicrobials prior to blood culture may have
hampered the detection of organisms susceptible to commonly used antimicrobials, 
including pneumococci, and thus the study probably underestimates the incidence
of bloodstream infection. The finding that antimicrobial resistance,
HIV-infection and malnutrition predict fatal outcome calls for renewed efforts to
curb the further emergence of resistance, improve HIV care and nutrition for
children.

Micro-epidemiology of Plasmodium falciparum malaria: Is there any difference in
transmission risk between neighbouring villages?

Author information: 
(1)African Population and Health Research Centre, PO Box 10787-00100 GPO Nairobi,
Kenya. yyazoume@aphrc.org.

BACKGROUND: Malaria control strategies are designed as a solution for either the 
whole region or the whole country and are assumed to suit every setting. There is
a need to shift from this assumption because transmission may be different from
one local setting to another. The aim of this study was to assess the risk of
clinical malaria given the village of residence among under-five children in
rural north-western Burkina Faso.
METHODS: 867 children (6-59 months) were randomly selected from four sites.
Interviewers visited the children weekly at home over a one-year period and
tested them for fever. Children with fever were tested for malaria parasites. An 
episode of clinical malaria was defined as fever (axillary temperature > or =
37.5 degrees C) + parasites density > or = 5,000 parasites/microl. Logistic
regression was used to assess the risk of clinical malaria among children at a
given site of residence.
RESULTS: Children accumulated 758 person years (PYs). Overall, 597 episodes of
clinical malaria were observed, giving an incidence rate of 0.79 per PY. The risk
of clinical malaria varied amongst the four sites. Taking one village as
reference the odds ratio for the other three sites ranged from 0.66; 95% CI:
0.44-0.98 to 1.49; 95% CI: 1.10-2.01.
CONCLUSION: Malaria control strategies should be designed to fit the local
context. The heterogeneity of transmission should be assessed at the district
level to allow cost-effective resource allocation that gives priority to
locations with high risk. Functional routine health information systems could
provide the necessary data for context specific risk assessment.

BACKGROUND: Although malaria imposes an enormous burden on Malawi, it remains a
controllable disease. The key strategies for control are based on early diagnosis
and prompt treatment with effective antimalarials. Its success, however, depends 
on understanding the factors influencing health care decision making at household
level, which has implications for implementing policies aimed at promoting health
care practices and utilization.
METHODS: An analysis of patterns of treatment-seeking behaviour among care-givers
of children of malarial fever in Malawi, based on the 2000 Malawi demographic and
health survey, is presented. The choice of treatment provider (home, shop, or
formal hospital care, others) was considered as a multi-categorical response, and
a multinomial logistic regression model was used to investigate determinants of
choosing any particular provider. The model incorporated random effects, at
subdistrict level, to measure the influence of geographical location on the
choice of any treatment provider. Inference was Bayesian and based on Markov
chain Monte Carlo techniques.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Spatial variation was found in the choice of a provider
and determinants of choice of any provider differed. Important risk factors
included place of residence, access to media, care-giver's age and care factors
including unavailability and inaccessibility of care. A greater effort is needed 
to improve the quality of malaria home treatment or expand health facility
utilization, at all levels of administration if reducing malaria is to be
realised in Malawi. Health promotion and education interventions should stress
promptness of health facility visits, improved access to appropriate drugs, and
accurate dosing for home-based treatments.

BACKGROUND: Hydropower plants provide more than 78 % of Brazil's electricity
generation, but the country's reservoirs are potential new habitats for main
vectors of malaria. In a case study in the surroundings of the Manso hydropower
plant in Mato Grosso state, Central Brazil, habitat suitability of Anopheles
darlingi was studied. Habitat profile was characterized by collecting
environmental data. Remote sensing and GIS techniques were applied to extract
additional spatial layers of land use, distance maps, and relief characteristics 
for spatial model building.
RESULTS: Logistic regression analysis and ROC curves indicate significant
relationships between the environment and presence of An. darlingi. Probabilities
of presence strongly vary as a function of land cover and distance from the lake 
shoreline. Vector presence was associated with spatial proximity to reservoir and
semi-deciduous forests followed by Cerrado woodland. Vector absence was
associated with open vegetation formations such as grasslands and agricultural
areas. We suppose that non-significant differences of vector incidences between
rainy and dry seasons are associated with the availability of anthropogenic
breeding habitat of the reservoir throughout the year.
CONCLUSION: Satellite image classification and multitemporal shoreline
simulations through DEM-based GIS-analyses consist in a valuable tool for spatial
modeling of A. darlingi habitats in the studied hydropower reservoir area. Vector
presence is significantly increased in forested areas near reservoirs in bays
protected from wind and wave action. Construction of new reservoirs under the
tropical, sub-humid climatic conditions should therefore be accompanied by
entomologic studies to predict the risk of malaria epidemics.

Recent advances have provided a working interactome map for the human malaria
parasite Plasmodium falciparum. The aforementioned map, generated from
genome-scale analyses, has provided a basis for proteomic studies of the
parasite; however, such large-scale approaches commonly suffer from undersampling
and lack of coverage. The current map bears no exception, containing only
one-quarter of the organism's proteins. Inspired by the needs of the current map 
and the wealth of bioinformatics data, we assembled a map of 19 979 interactions 
among 2321 proteins in P. falciparum. The resultant map was generated by
computationally inferring protein-protein interactions from evolutionarily
conserved protein interactions, underlying domain interactions, and experimental 
observations. To compile this information into a repository of meaningful data,
we assessed interaction quality by applying a logistic regression method, which
correlated the presence of an interaction with relevant cellular parameters.
Interestingly, it was found that sub-networks from different sources are quite
dissimilar in their topologies and overlap to a very small extent. Applying
Markov clustering, we observe a typical cluster composition, featuring common
cellular functions that were previously reported absent, making this map a
valuable resource for understanding the biology of this organism.

Comment in
    Am J Trop Med Hyg. 2007 Feb;76(2):201-2.

We used logistic regression to assess effectiveness of primaquine as Plasmodium
vivax anti-relapse therapy using data extracted from studies of P. vivax relapses
in Brazil, India, and Thailand. The risk of relapse in Thailand was 10 times that
in India and twice that in Brazil. In comparison with no primaquine treatment,
the risk of relapse decreased by approximately 80% for a total adult primaquine
regimen of 210 mg and by > or =95% for regimens of 315 mg and 420 mg. In
addition, we used logistic regression to estimate the risk of P. vivax relapse
according to weight-based primaquine dose using data from case studies. There was
a three-fold increase in the likelihood of successful treatment of each
additional milligram of primaquine per kilogram of body weight. Tailoring
primaquine therapy to a region requires consideration of factors including body
weight, natural relapse rates, and local response to primaquine.

Increased postpartum blood loss in pregnancies associated with placental malaria.

Uddenfeldt Wort U(1), Hastings I, Bergström S, Massawe S, Lipingu C, Brabin BJ.

Author information: 
(1)Division of International Health (IHCAR), Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm,
Sweden.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship of placental malaria and parity with
postpartum blood loss in a malarious area of Tanzania.
METHODS: A total of 706 uncomplicated vaginal deliveries were studied at
Muhimbili University Hospital, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Maternal age, parity,
date of delivery, birth weight, presence of placental malaria, stillbirths, and
delivery complications were noted. Collection and measurement of vaginal blood
loss commenced immediately following birth using a plastic vinyl sheet placed
underneath the mother. The bed was divided in the middle to allow the blood to
drain into a bucket. Blood loss was measured for a period of 2 h following
delivery.
RESULTS: In singleton births the mean postpartum blood loss was 170 mL in
nulliparas and 187 mL in multiparas (p=0.017). Blood loss was 400 mL or greater
in 23 women (3.4%) and 500 mL or greater in 10 women (1.5%). Mean postpartum
bleeding tended to increase with maternal age, parity, and birth weight. In
logistic regression the odds ratio for a blood loss of 400 mL or greater was
significantly increased for women with placental malaria (3.2; 95% confidence
interval, 1.1-9.0; p=0.028), after adjusting for a birth weight greater than 4000
g. Placental malaria showed a marked seasonal pattern, which corresponded to the 
months of peak prevalence for a postpartum blood loss of 400 mL or greater
(p=0.007).
CONCLUSION: A postpartum blood loss of 400 mL or greater should be considered a
possible complication of placental malaria.

INTRODUCTION: Health education interventions have proved effective in improving
knowledge, preventing practices and decreasing occurrence of malaria.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of the educational intervention "The World of
Malaria: Let's Learn to Manage it in Community" developed in Colombian malarial
areas, in terms of increasing knowledge, preventive practices, treatment-seeking,
and decreasing malaria occurrence.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A quasi-experimental post-test study with a non-equivalent
control group was carried out. Four hundred and fifty people living in 20 rural
villages were interviewed. These localities were randomly selected from 110
intervened localities. Paired "t" test was performed to evaluate the effect on
malaria knowledge of the community health workers (n=243). The effect of the
intervention on the effect variables was measured by using logistic regression
and by comparing people who were exposed and non-exposed to the educational
strategy.
RESULTS: Knowledge on malaria in community health workers increased after the
intervention (p < 0.05). In the communities, 170/447 (38%) interviewed
individuals had contact with the intervention in the communities. Those exposed
to the intervention showed improvements in knowledge about breeding sites (OR:
2.53, 95% IC:1.7-3.76), bed-nets use (OR:1.81, 95% IC:1.10-2.97) and a decrease
in self-medication with antimalarial drugs (OR:1.97, 95% IC: 1.04-3.73). Contact 
with the intervention reduced reported episodes of malaria (OR:0.58, 95% CI:
0.39-0.87).
CONCLUSION: Significant improvements in preventive practices may be achieved with
educational interventions, which in turn may reduce malaria ocurrence.

Efficacy of three artemisinin combination therapies for the treatment of
uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in the Republic of Congo.

Author information:

<ingrid.van.den.broek@rivm.nl>

BACKGROUND: Presented here are the results of a comparative trial on the efficacy
of three artemisinin-based combinations conducted from May to October 2004, in
Pool Province, Republic of Congo.
METHODS: The main outcome was the proportion of cases of true treatment success
at day 28. Recrudescences were distinguished from re-infections by PCR analysis. 
A total of 298 children of 6-59 months were randomized to receive either
artesunate + SP (AS+SP), artesunate + amodiaquine (AS+AQ) or artemether +
lumefantrine (AL), of which 15 (5%) were lost to follow-up.
RESULTS: After 28 days, there were 21/85 (25%) recurrent parasitaemias in the
AS+SP group, 31/97 (32%) in the AS+AQ group and 13/100 (13%) in the AL group. The
28-day PCR-corrected cure rate was 90.1% [95% CI 80.7-95.9] for AS+SP, 98.5% [95%
CI 92.0-100] for AS+AQ and 100% [95.8-100] for AL, thereby revealing a weaker
response to AS+SP than to AL (p = 0.003) and to AS+AQ (p = 0.06). A potential
bias was the fact that children treated with AL were slightly older and in better
clinical condition, but logistic regression did not identify these as relevant
factors. There was no significant difference between groups in fever and parasite
clearance time, improvement of anaemia and gametocyte carriage at day 28. No
serious adverse events were reported.
CONCLUSION: Considering the higher efficacy of AL as compared to AS+SP and the
relatively high proportion of cases with re-infections in the AS+AQ group, we
conclude that AL is clinically more effective than AS+SP and AS+AQ in this area
of the Republic of Congo. Implementation of the recently chosen new national
first-line AS+AQ should be monitored closely.

Literacy and recent history of diarrhoea are predictive of Plasmodium falciparum 
parasitaemia in Kenyan adults.

rodney.coldren@afrims.org

BACKGROUND: Malaria is one of the most serious health problems in Kenya. In 2004,
the Kenya Medical Research Institute and the US Army Medical Research Unit--Kenya
surveyed adults in Samburu, Malindi, and Busia districts to determine
socioeconomic risk factors for infection.
METHODS: Sociodemographic, health, and antimalarial data were collected along
with blood for malaria testing. A smear was considered negative only if no
Plasmodium falciparum parasites were observed in 100 high-powered fields.
Univariate analysis was performed with Pearson's Chi-square test and univariate
logistic regression. A multivariate logistic regression model was then created
which included only variables found to be at least marginally significant in
univariate analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 1,141 subjects were recruited: 238 from Samburu, 442 from
Malindi, and 461 from Busia. Smear positivities for P. falciparum were 1.7% in
Samburu, 7.2% in Malindi and 22.3% in Busia. Interdistrict differences were
statistically significant (p < 0.001) in univariate analysis and in a
multivariate logistic regression model which included district, literacy,
occupation, and recent illness as independent variables. In the model, literacy
and recent diarrhoeal illness were positively and at least marginally
significantly associated with parasitaemia (p = 0.023 and p = 0.067,
respectively). Neither age, sex, occupation, history of malaria in the previous
three months, nor use of antimalarials in the previous four weeks were
significantly associated with parasitaemia.
CONCLUSION: While district of residence was the variable most highly predictive
for parasitaemia among Kenyan adults surveyed, both a recent history of
diarrhoeal illness and literacy were at least marginally statistically
significant predictors.

Nigeria. huche57@yahoo.com

There is paucity of data on the risk factors associated with congenital malaria
in Nigeria. This study assessed the risk factors for congenital malaria in a
population of neonates delivered at the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, 
Enugu, South Eastern Nigeria. It was a prospective cross-sectional study of
neonates who were delivered in the institution from 2 April 2003 to 15 April 2004
as well as their mothers. Thick and thin blood films were made from maternal,
baby and cord blood as well as the placenta for each mother/baby pair to
determine malaria parasite density counts and for species identification. The
maternal samples were obtained as soon as labour was confirmed while the cord and
baby's blood as well as placental smears were taken within 1 h of delivery. Data 
analysis was by means of descriptive and inferential statistics as well as
univariate and multivariate logistic regression at the 95% confidence level using
the statistical software SPSS for Windows Version 10. A total of 658 mother/baby 
pairs were recruited into the study within the 13-month period. Out of this
number, 625 mother/baby pairs completed the study and their data were
subsequently analysed. A total of 356 (56.96%) mothers and 203 (32.48%) babies
were smear positive for Plasmodium falciparum. On univariate logistic regression 
with presence or absence of the congenital malaria as the dependent variable, six
out of the 13 putative risk factors tested were statistically significant. These 
were low compared with higher socioeconomic classes (OR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.18 -
1.69, p = 0.00); low compared with normal birth weight (OR = 2.14, 95% CI = 1.39 
- 3.30, p = 0.001); positive placental malaria parasitaemia (OR = 6.29, 95% CI,
4.73 - 8.37, p = 0.000), positive maternal blood malaria parasitaemia (OR = 5.04,
95% CI = 3.74 - 6.78, p = 0.000), positive cord blood malaria parasitaemia (OR = 
26.87, 95% = 15.79 - 45.74, p = 0.000) and parity of 0 - 1 compared with other
parities (OR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.11 - 1.55, p = 0.002). On multivariate logistic
regression, three of the six factors that were significant on univariate logistic
regression remained significant. These were: positive placental malaria
parasitaemia (OR = 2.55, 95% CI = 1.45 - 4.47, p = 0.001); positive cord malaria 
parasitaemia (OR = 18.90, 95% CI = 10.68 - 33.46, p = 0.000 and parity of 0 - 1
compared with other parities (OR = 1.66, 95% CI = 1.09 - 2.52, p = 0.02). It was 
concluded that the risk factors for congenital malaria identified in this study
emphasise the need for effective preventive and curative treatment of malaria not
only during pregnancy but also during delivery in malaria endemic areas.
Additionally, congenital malaria should now rank high among the list of
differential diagnosis of fever in the newborn in such endemic areas.

Test for interaction between two unlinked loci.

Zhao J(1), Jin L, Xiong M.

Author information: 
(1)Human Genetics Center, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston,
Houston, TX 77225, USA.

Despite the growing consensus on the importance of testing gene-gene interactions
in genetic studies of complex diseases, the effect of gene-gene interactions has 
often been defined as a deviance from genetic additive effects, which is
essentially treated as a residual term in genetic analysis and leads to low power
in detecting the presence of interacting effects. To what extent the definition
of gene-gene interaction at population level reflects the genes' biochemical or
physiological interaction remains a mystery. In this article, we introduce a
novel definition and a new measure of gene-gene interaction between two unlinked 
loci (or genes). We developed a general theory for studying linkage
disequilibrium (LD) patterns in disease population under two-locus disease
models. The properties of using the LD measure in a disease population as a
function of the measure of gene-gene interaction between two unlinked loci were
also investigated. We examined how interaction between two loci creates LD in a
disease population and showed that the mathematical formulation of the new
definition for gene-gene interaction between two loci was similar to that of the 
LD between two loci. This finding motived us to develop an LD-based statistic to 
detect gene-gene interaction between two unlinked loci. The null distribution and
type I error rates of the LD-based statistic for testing gene-gene interaction
were validated using extensive simulation studies. We found that the new test
statistic was more powerful than the traditional logistic regression under three 
two-locus disease models and demonstrated that the power of the test statistic
depends on the measure of gene-gene interaction. We also investigated the impact 
of using tagging SNPs for testing interaction on the power to detect interaction 
between two unlinked loci. Finally, to evaluate the performance of our new
method, we applied the LD-based statistic to two published data sets. Our results
showed that the P values of the LD-based statistic were smaller than those
obtained by other approaches, including logistic regression models.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The involvement of private drug vendors in malaria
treatment is particularly high in developing countries and understanding their
practices and knowledge about antimalarials and malaria treatment will aid in
devising strategies to increase the correct use of antimalarials and improve
adherence to the government's malaria drug policy. Results of a study on the
knowledge and practices of the private drug vendors conducted in seven districts 
in Sri Lanka, mostly in malarious areas are presented.
METHODS: Data on awareness of government's malaria drug policy, practice of
issuing antimalarials, knowledge about malaria and antimalarial drugs were
collected from the drug vendors using pre-tested questionnaire in vernacular
language. Data were statistically analysed using Stata 8.2. Chi-square test was
carried out for individual explanatory variables and a logistic regression model 
was applied taking all response variables as binary outcome.
RESULTS: Vendors' knowledge on antimalarials was poor with 58% of the vendors
being unaware of the government malaria drug policy in the country. Also, the
advice provided to customers buying antimalarials was limited. However, the
majority of the private vendors emphasised that they were aware of the importance
of case confirmation before treatment as stressed in the national policy.
Although, the vendors did not have a high awareness of national drug policies
they were only found selling chloroquine and primaquine as recommended by the
Ministry of Health.
INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSION: In recent years Sri Lanka, as a whole, has
experienced very little malaria. The reduction in demand for antimalarials due to
low incidence levels may have influenced the knowledge and awareness on
antimalarials and government drug policies. However, since low levels of malaria 
do not guarantee that epidemics will not occur, attempts to educate private drug 
vendors as a part of an organised control programmes are of major importance.

Predictors of treatment error for children with uncomplicated malaria seen as
outpatients in Blantyre district, Malawi.

Osterholt DM(1), Rowe AK, Hamel MJ, Flanders WD, Mkandala C, Marum LH, Kaimila N.

Author information:

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA 30341-3724, USA.

BACKGROUND: Past studies have shown that health workers in developing countries
often do not follow clinical guidelines, though few studies have explored with
appropriate methods why errors occur. To develop interventions that improve
health worker performance, factors affecting treatment practices must be better
understood.
METHODS: We analysed data from a health facility survey in Blantyre District,
Malawi, in which health workers were observed treating ill children, and then
children were independently re-examined by 'gold-standard' study clinicians. The 
analysis was limited to children with uncomplicated malaria (defined according to
Malawi's guidelines as fever or anaemia without signs of severe illness), and a
treatment error was defined as failure to treat with an effective antimalarial.
RESULTS: Twenty-eight health workers and 349 ill-child consultations were
evaluated; 247 (70.8%) children were treated with an effective antimalarial, and 
102 (29.2%) were subject to treatment error. Logistic regression analysis
revealed that in-service malaria training was not associated with treatment
quality (univariate odds ratio (OR) = 1.16, 95% confidence interval (CI):
0.46-2.93); whereas acute respiratory infections training was associated with
making an error (adjusted OR (aOR) = 2.42, 95% CI: 1.23-4.76). High fever and
chief complaint of fever were associated with fewer errors (aOR = 0.25, 95% CI:
0.10-0.60 and aOR = 0.25, 95% CI: 0.13-0.48, respectively). Errors were more
likely to occur in consultations starting before 1 p.m. (aOR = 1.88, 95% CI:
1.07-3.31). Supervision was not associated with better treatment quality.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the disease-specific training and
supervision, performed before the survey, did not lead to long-term improvements 
in health care quality. Furthermore, case management training for one specific
disease may have worsened quality of care for another disease. These results
support integration of guidelines for multiple conditions. Interventions should
be evaluated for unintended negative effects on overall quality of care.

The relationship between reproductive outcome measures in DDT exposed malaria
vector control workers: a cross-sectional study.

and Family Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Cape Town, Anzio
Road, Observatory, 7925, Cape Town, South Africa. aqiel@cormack.uct.ac.za

BACKGROUND: The utility of blood reproductive endocrine biomarkers for assessing 
or estimating semen quality was explored.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 47 DDT exposed malaria vector control workers
was performed. Tests included blood basal and post gonadotrophin releasing
hormone (GnRH), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH),
testosterone, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), estradiol (E2) and inhibin; a 
questionnaire (demographics and general medical history); a physical examination 
and semen analysis. Semen parameters were determined using either/or or both WHO 
or the strict Tygerberg criteria. Relationships between semen parameters and
endocrine measures were adjusted for age, duration of abstinence before sampling,
presence of physical abnormalities and fever in the last two months. All
relationships between specific endocrine hormones were adjusted for age and basal
SHBG.
RESULTS: Multiple logistic regression showed a consistent positive relationship
(prevalence odds ratio (POR) = 8.2, CI:1.4-49.2) between low basal inhibin (< 100
pg/ml) and low semen count (< 40 million) and density (< 20 million/ml);
consistent positive, but weaker relationships (1 > POR < 2) between abnormally
low semen count as well as density and baseline and post GnRH FSH; and positive
relationships (POR = 37, CI:2-655) between the prevalence of high basal estradiol
(> 50 pg/ml) and abnormal morphology (proportion < 5%) and low motility
(proportion < 50%). Most of the expected physiological relationships between
specific endocrines were significant.
CONCLUSION: The study has demonstrated that low basal inhibin, elevated basal FSH
and high basal E2 can serve as markers of impaired semen quality.

Who sleeps under bednets in Ghana? A doer/non-doer analysis of malaria prevention
behaviours.

BACKGROUND: Malaria prevention programmes should be based in part on knowledge of
why some individuals use bednets while others do not. This paper identifies
factors and characteristics of women that affect bednet use among their children 
less than five years of age in Ghana.
METHODS: Data come from the baseline component of an evaluation of Freedom from
Hunger's malaria curriculum. A quasi-experimental design was used to select
clients (n = 516) of Credit with Education (an integrated package of microfinance
and health education) and non-clients (n = 535). Chi-squares, Fisher's Exact
tests and logistic regression were used to compare the characteristics of mothers
whose children use bednets (doers) with those whose children do not (non-doers)
and to identify factors associated with bednet use among children less than five 
years of age.
RESULTS: The following factors were most closely associated with bednet use:
region of residence; greater food security; and caregivers' beliefs about
symptoms, causation and groups most vulnerable to malaria. Most respondents knew 
mosquitoes caused malaria; however, 20.6% of doers and 12.3% of non-doers (p =
.0228) thought overworking oneself caused malaria. Ninety percent of doers and
77.0% of non-doers felt that sleeping under a net was protective against malaria 
(p = .0040). In addition, 16.5% of doers and 7.5% of non-doers (p = .0025)
identified adult males as most vulnerable to malaria.
CONCLUSION: Greater knowledge about malaria does not always translate into
improved bednet use. Though culturally-based ideas about malaria may vary between
communities, integrating them into traditional health education messages may
enhance the effectiveness of public health efforts.

Birth outcomes in adolescent pregnancy in an area with intense malaria
transmission in Tanzania.

Author information: 
(1)Division of International Health (IHCAR), Department of Public Health
Sciences, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.

BACKGROUND: Although the effects of malaria for the mother and young baby are
well described in developing countries, there is very little data on the
consequences for adolescent pregnancies. This paper analyses birth outcome in
adolescent pregnancy in an area of Tanzania with intense malaria transmission.
METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive analysis of 528 adolescents and 1,156
adults, malaria prevalence, and birth weight outcomes for women delivering in
Kilosa Hospital between June 2001 and October 2002.
RESULTS: This area has high malaria transmissions with some seasonality.
Adolescent primigravidae had higher parasite prevalence than adolescent
secundigravidae (41.3% versus 28.1%, p > 0.05), and than adult primigravidae
(41.3% versus 31.5%, p = 0.007). Low birth weight prevalence was highest among
adolescents delivering during the malaria season (odds ratio 1.7, 95% CI 1.1-2.6,
p = 0.02), and was double that of adult primigravidae (31.5% versus 15.9%, p =
0.021). The prevalence of parasitemia (p = 0.003) and low birth weight (p =
0.033) declined with increasing age amongst adolescent primigravidae. Adjusted
logistic regression showed a 1.4-fold increased risk of low birth weight amongst 
adolescents (95% CI, 0.98-1.96).
CONCLUSIONS: Failure to prioritize adolescent malaria will seriously limit the
success of malaria control programs in pregnancy.

Socio-cultural determinants of treatment delay for childhood malaria in southern 
Ghana.

Author information:

Ghana.

We studied socio-cultural determinants of timely appropriate treatment seeking
for children under 5 years suspected of having a perceived malaria-related
illness. Caretakers of children with suspected malaria were interviewed about
illness-related experiences, meanings and behaviour in two endemic villages in
southern Ghana. Only 11% of children suspected of having a perceived
malaria-related illness received timely appropriate treatment consistent with the
Abuja target of treating malaria within 24 h of illness onset; 33% of children
received appropriate treatment within 48 h. Reported perceived causes of phlegm
predicted timely, appropriate treatment within 24 h of illness onset (P = 0.04)
in a multivariate logistic regression model; playing on the ground (P < 0.01)
predicted such treatment within 48 h. Two categories of distress, paleness or
shortage of blood (P = 0.05) and sweating profusely (P = 0.03), also predicted
timely, appropriate treatment within 24 h in a multivariate logistic regression
model. Knowing that mosquitoes transmit malaria was not associated with timely,
appropriate help seeking for the children, even though such knowledge may promote
personal protective measures, especially use of bednets. Patterns of distress and
PC were related to timely, appropriate help seeking, but not as expected. Effects
on health seeking of illness-related experience and meaning are complex, and
explaining their role may strengthen interventions for childhood malaria.

infection during pregnancy.

Malarial infection during pregnancy leads to placental infection, a known risk
factor for low birth weight. Whether the stage of pregnancy at infection has a
differential influence on these effects is not clearly known, but may be of
importance for prevention strategies, including intermittent preventive treatment
of pregnant women. Malaria infection during early (before 20 weeks), middle
(20-28 weeks), or late (after 28 weeks) pregnancy was evaluated by logistic
regression and receiver operating characteristics analysis in relation to
placental infection in pregnant Senegalese women. Plasmodium falciparum
infections during late pregnancy are strongly related to placental infection, as 
well as those that occur in middle pregnancy. Knowledge of parasitological events
over the entire duration of pregnancy permits a highly accurate prediction of
placental infection. Not only malaria infections during late pregnancy increase
the likelihood of placental infection. The current policy of intermittent
preventive treatment of pregnant women, which implies an initial antimalarial
cure after 20 weeks of pregnancy, will not avoid early infections. An earlier
initiation of malaria prevention might improve its efficacy.

OBJECTIVE: This paper describes determinants of insecticide treated net (ITN)
ownership and use in malarious areas of Eritrea. With ITN distribution and
re-treatment now free for all living in these areas, we examine barriers (other
than cost) to access and use of ITNs. We explore the differences between use of
an ITN as a proportion of all households in the survey (the roll back malaria
indicator), and use of an ITN as a proportion of those households who already own
an ITN.
METHODS: A modified two-stage cluster design was used to collect data from a
sample of households (n = 2341) in the three most malarious administrative zobas 
(zones or provinces). Logistic regression was used to analyse the data.
RESULTS: Our findings suggest environmental heterogeneity among zobas (including 
program effects specific to each zoba), perception of risk, and proximity to a
clinic are important predictors of ITN possession and use. Among households with 
at least one ITN, 17.0% reported that children under five were not under an ITN
the night before the survey, while half of all such households did not have all
occupants using them the night before the survey. The number of ITNs, as well as 
zoba, was also significant determinants of use in these households with at least 
one ITN.
CONCLUSION: Current efforts to disseminate ITNs to vulnerable populations in
Eritrea are working, as suggested by high ITN ownership and net-to-person ratios 
inside households. However, the gap between ITN ownership and use, given
ownership, is large, and may represent lost opportunities to prevent infection.
Closing this gap requires concerted efforts to change behaviour to ensure that
all household members use ITNs as consistently and correctly as possible during
and following the rains.

HIV as an additional risk factors for anaemia in pregnancy: evidence from primary
care level in Ibadan, Southwestern Nigeria.

Anaemia in pregnancy has serious consequences including maternal morbidity and
impairment of infant cognitive development. Several authors have however reported
inconsistent findings on risk factors for anaemia in pregnancy. This study was
carried out to determine risk factors for anaemia in pregnancy among women at
primary care level and document the contribution of HIV/AIDS to anaemia in
pregnancy in low risk pregnant women at primary care level. A prospective study
carried out among pregnant women attending the booking clinics of primary health 
care centres in Ibadan, Nigeria. HIV positive and HIV negative mothers were
followed throughout pregnancy till delivery of their babies. History of use of
iron, folate, Vitamin B complex and daraprim were obtained. Haemoglobin, malaria 
parasitaemia, and HIV serostatus were determined. Use of iron (P < 0.006), folate
(P = 0.032), vitamin B complex (P = 0.001) and treatment for malaria (P = 0.05)
significantly reduced the risk for anaemia in pregnancy. Malaria parasitaemia (P 
= 0.0001) significantly increased the risk of anaemia. However, use of daraprim
and HIV seropositivity increased the risk of anaemia in pregnancy but not
significantly. In a logistic regression analysis, iron (P = 0.001) and folate
supplementation (P = 0.015) significantly protected against anaemia in pregnancy 
while malaria parasitaemia (P = 0.006) and HIV seropositivity (P = 0.015) were
significant adverse risk factors. HIV is an additional risk factor for anaemia in
pregnancy. Voluntary counseling and testing of pregnant women for HIV is
therefore also indicated at primary care level to detect asymptomatic anaemia in 
pregnancy that may be due to HIV.

Sciences, Nottingham NG7 2UH, UK. mzywtr@nottingham.ac.uk

Malaria is a major cause of morbidity and mortality amongst adults in sub-Saharan
Africa, but descriptions of symptoms and mortality in this group have received
little attention in the past. A retrospective study was performed on adults
admitted to a tertiary hospital in Tanzania with a primary diagnosis of malaria. 
Frequency and mortality for the criteria in the WHO definition of severe malaria 
were recorded. Logistic regression analysis was then used to identify symptoms
with the greatest prognostic value. Two hundred and sixty-nine adults (median age
28 years) with a primary diagnosis of malaria were studied, with an overall
mortality rate of 15.2%. Logistic regression identified three key prognostic
indicators: unconsciousness (odds ratio (OR) 44.44; 95% CI 4.05-488.24), renal
failure (OR 7.37; 95% CI 1.70-31.96) and pulmonary oedema (OR 13.83; 95% CI
3.52-54.32). Whilst the WHO criteria predicted all of the 41 adults who died, 37 
(90.2%) had at least one of the following symptoms: unconsciousness (n=39,
fatality rate 74.4%), renal failure (n=26, fatality rate 66.7%) and pulmonary
oedema (n=28, fatality rate 64.3%). These symptoms can therefore identify those
at a high risk of death in African adults with malaria.

Topology and weights in a protein domain interaction network--a novel way to
predict protein interactions.

Wuchty S(1).

Author information: 
(1)Northwestern Institute on Complexity, Northwestern University, 600 Foster
Street, Evanston, IL 60208, USA. s-wuchty@northwestern.edu

BACKGROUND: While the analysis of unweighted biological webs as diverse as
genetic, protein and metabolic networks allowed spectacular insights in the inner
workings of a cell, biological networks are not only determined by their static
grid of links. In fact, we expect that the heterogeneity in the utilization of
connections has a major impact on the organization of cellular activities as
well.
RESULTS: We consider a web of interactions between protein domains of the Protein
Family database (PFAM), which are weighted by a probability score. We apply
metrics that combine the static layout and the weights of the underlying
interactions. We observe that unweighted measures as well as their weighted
counterparts largely share the same trends in the underlying domain interaction
network. However, we only find weak signals that weights and the static grid of
interactions are connected entities. Therefore assuming that a protein
interaction is governed by a single domain interaction, we observe strong and
significant correlations of the highest scoring domain interaction and the
confidence of protein interactions in the underlying interactions of yeast and
fly. Modeling an interaction between proteins if we find a high scoring protein
domain interaction we obtain 1, 428 protein interactions among 361 proteins in
the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Assessing their quality by a
logistic regression method we observe that increasing confidence of predicted
interactions is accompanied by high scoring domain interactions and elevated
levels of functional similarity and evolutionary conservation.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that probability scores are randomly
distributed, allowing to treat static grid and weights of domain interactions as 
separate entities. In particular, these finding confirms earlier observations
that a protein interaction is a matter of a single interaction event on domain
level. As an immediate application, we show a simple way to predict potential
protein interactions by utilizing expectation scores of single domain
interactions.

Chemoprophylaxis and malaria death rates.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Robert Koch-Institute, Berlin, 
Germany. krauseg@rki.de

To determine the effect of chemoprophylaxis on the case-fatality rate of malaria,
we analyzed all cases of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in nonimmune persons
reported from 1993 to 2004 in Germany. In univariate and multivariate logistic
regression analysis, we determined the effect of age, sex, chemoprophylaxis,
chemoprophylactic regimen, compliance for chemoprophylactic regimen, exposure
prophylaxis, country of infection, and year of reporting on the outcome. Of 3,935
case-patients, 116 (3%) died of malaria. Univariate analysis showed significant
associations with death for chemoprophylaxis with chloroquine plus proguanil
compared to no chemoprophylaxis. The multivariate model showed that patients who 
had taken chemoprophylaxis were less likely to die compared to those who had not 
taken chemoprophylaxis, adjusted for patient age and reporting year. The study
demonstrated that chemoprophylaxis significantly reduced fatality rates among
nonimmune malaria patients and supports the importance of existing guidelines for
malaria prevention.

Immunity to the sexual stages of Plasmodium falciparum is induced during natural 
infections and can significantly reduce the transmission of parasites to
mosquitoes (transmission reducing activity; TRA) but little is known about how
these responses develop with increasing age/exposure to malaria. Routinely TRA is
measured in the standard membrane feeding assay (SMFA). Sera were collected from 
a total of 199 gametocyte carriers (median age 4 years, quartiles 2 and 9 years) 
near Ifakara, Tanzania; 128 samples were tested in the SMFA and generated TRA
data classified as a reduction of > 50% and > 90% of transmission. TRA of > 50%
was highest in young children (aged 1-2) with a significant decline with age
(chi(2) trend = 5.79, P = 0.016) and in logistic regression was associated with
prevalence of antibodies to both Pfs230 and Pfs48/45 (OR 4.03, P = 0.011 and OR
2.43 P = 0.059, respectively). A TRA of > 90% reduction in transmission was not
age related but was associated with antibodies to Pfs48/45 (OR 2.36, P = 0.055). 
Our data confirm that antibodies are an important component of naturally induced 
TRA. However, whilst a similar but small proportion of individuals at all ages
have TRA > 90%, the gradual deterioration of TRA > 50% with age suggests
decreased antibody concentration or affinity. This may be due to decreased
exposure to gametocytes, probably as a result of increased asexual and/or
gametocyte specific immunity.

BACKGROUND: Anemia in pregnancy remains a major problem in nearly all developing 
and many industrialized countries. In Mali, the subpopulation prevalence and
etiology of anemia during pregnancy are largely unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the prevalence and likely etiologies of anemia in pregnancy
in a poor urban population in Bamako, Mali.
METHODS: Pregnant women (n = 190) were selected randomly. Hemoglobin, serum iron,
and total iron-binding capacity were measured; blood smears were examined for
Plasmodium falciparum malaria; and single stool and urine samples were examined
for Schistosoma haematobium and hookworm. Gynecologic examinations were performed
and interviews conducted to qualitatively assess food consumption and other
socioeconomic characteristics. Associations among mild, moderate, and severe
anemia; iron and parasite status; erythrocyte sedimentation rates; and the
presence of abnormal vaginal discharge were evaluated. Differences in hemoglobin 
and serum iron concentrations, total iron-binding capacity, and anemia were
compared according to trimester of pregnancy and between infected and noninfected
women. The relative and attributable risks of anemia were calculated, and
adjusted odds ratios for anemia and low serum iron were estimated by multivariate
logistic regression.
RESULTS: Of the 131 women for whom complete data were available, 47% had
hemoglobin concentrations below 110 g/L; 13% had serum iron concentrations below 
12 micromol/L; none had transferrin saturation values below 16%; 11%, 23%, and 8%
harbored P. falciparum, S. haematobium, and hookworm, respectively; and 82% had
an abnormal vaginal discharge. Food restrictions were reported by 45% of the
women. Abnormal vaginal discharge correlated significantly with anemia (Pearson
chi2 = 62.4; p < .01). Univariate and multivariate analyses found that infections
were strongly associated with and predictive of anemia.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that infections and food accessibility contribute
to the high rates of anemia during pregnancy in Mali.

Malarial anemia (MA) is a multifactorial disease for which the complex
etiological basis is only partially defined. The association of clinical,
nutritional, demographic, and socioeconomic factors with parasitemia, anemia, and
MA was determined for children presenting at a hospital in a holoendemic area of 
Plasmodium falciparum transmission in western Kenya. Parasitemia was not
associated with malaria disease severity. In univariate logistic regression,
fever was significantly associated with parasitemia, and wasting was associated
with increased presentation of MA. Caretaker's level of education and occupation 
were significantly correlated with parasitemia, anemia, and MA. Housing structure
was also significantly associated with parasitemia and anemia. Bed net use was
protective against parasitemia but not anemia or MA. Multivariate logistic
regression models demonstrated that fever, mother's occupation, and bed net use
were associated with parasitemia. In the current study, none of the factors were 
associated with anemia or MA in the multivariate models.

BACKGROUND: On the island of Bioko (Equatorial Guinea), insecticide-treated nets 
(ITNs) have been the main tool used to control malaria over the last 13 years. In
2004, started an indoor residual spraying (IRS) campaign to control malaria. The 
purpose of this study is to asses the impact of the two control strategies on the
island of Bioko (Equatorial Guinea), with regards to Plasmodium infection and
anaemia in the children under five years of age.
METHODS: Two transversal studies, the first one prior to the start of the IRS
campaign and the second one year later. Sampling was carried out by stratified
clusters. Malaria infection was measured by means of thick and thin film, and the
packed cell volume (PCV) percentage. Data related to ITN use and information
regarding IRS were collected. The Pearson's chi-square and logistic regression
statistical tests were used to calculate odds ratios (OR).
RESULTS: In the first survey, 168 children were sampled and 433 children in the
second one. The prevalence of infection was 40% in 2004, and significantly lower 
at 21.7% in 2005. PCV was 41% and 39%, respectively. 58% of the children surveyed
in 2004 and 44.3% in 2005 had slept under an ITN. 78% of the dwellings studied in
2005 had been sprayed. In the 2005 survey, sleeping without a mosquito net meant 
a risk of infection 3 times greater than sleeping protected with a net hanged
correctly and with no holes (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: IRS and ITNs have proven to be effective control strategies on the
island of Bioko. The choice of one or other strategy is, above all, a question of
operational feasibility and availability of local resources.

The study was undertaken in southeastern Nigeria to investigate whether the
people's level of education and what they know about malaria affects how they
seek treatment and prevention for the disease. Pre-tested questionnaires were
used to collect data from randomly selected householders and analysed using
logistic regression. Higher levels of education were associated with improved
knowledge and practice about the appropriate strategies for the prevention and
treatment of malaria. The results thus indicate that education can have a
positive impact on the malaria burden and medium/long-term improvement of overall
literacy rates. As well as this, short-term health education campaigns about the 
causes, manifestations and control of malaria will have a positive impact on its 
control.

BACKGROUND: Insecticide-treated bed nets (ITN) provide real hope for the
reduction of the malaria burden across Africa. Understanding factors that
determine access to ITN is crucial to debates surrounding the optimal delivery
systems. The influence of homestead wealth on use of nets purchased from the
retail sector is well documented, however, the competing influence of mother's
education and physical access to net providers is less well understood.
METHODS: Between December 2004 and January 2005, a random sample of 72 rural
communities was selected across four Kenyan districts. Demographic, assets,
education and net use data were collected at homestead, mother and child (aged < 
5 years) levels. An assets-based wealth index was developed using principal
components analysis, travel time to net sources was modelled using geographic
information systems, and factors influencing the use of retail sector nets
explored using a multivariable logistic regression model.
RESULTS: Homestead heads and guardians of 3,755 children < 5 years of age were
interviewed. Approximately 15% (562) of children slept under a net the night
before the interview; 58% (327) of the nets used were purchased from the retail
sector. Homestead wealth (adjusted OR = 10.17, 95% CI = 5.45-18.98), travel time 
to nearest market centres (adjusted OR = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.37-0.72) and mother's
education (adjusted OR = 2.92, 95% CI = 1.93-4.41) were significantly associated 
with use of retail sector nets by children aged less than 5 years.
CONCLUSION: Approaches to promoting access to nets through the retail sector
disadvantage poor and remote communities where mothers are less well educated.

The contribution of microscopy to targeting antimalarial treatment in a low
transmission area of Tanzania.

Tropical Medicine, Keppel St, London WCIE 7HT, UK. hugh.reyburn@lshtm.ac.uk

BACKGROUND: There is a need for improved targeting of antimalarial treatment if
artemisinin combination therapy is to be successfully introduced in Africa. This 
study aimed to explore why malaria slides are requested and how their results
guide treatment decisions in an area of low transmission of P. falciparum.
METHODS: Outpatients attending a district hospital in a highland area of Tanzania
were studied over a 3-week period. Clinical and social data were collected from
patients who had been prescribed an antimalarial or sent for a malaria slide.
Hospital slides were re-read later by research methods.
RESULTS: Of 1,273 consultations 132(10%) were treated presumptively for malaria
and 214(17%) were sent for a malaria slide; only 13(6%) of these were reported
positive for P. falciparum but 96(48%) of the 201 slide-negative cases were
treated for malaria anyway. In a logistic regression model, adults (OR 3.86, P < 
0.01), a history of fever (OR1.72, P = 0.03) and a longer travel time to the
clinic (OR 1.77 per hour travelled, P < 0.01) independently predicted the request
for a malaria slide. Only a history of a cough predicted (negatively) the
prescription of an antimalarial with a negative slide result (OR 0.44, P < 0.01).
The sensitivity and specificity of hospital slide results were 50% and 96%
respectively.
CONCLUSION: Progress in targeting of antimalarials in low malaria transmission
settings is likely to depend on consistent use of malaria microscopy and on the
willingness of health workers to be guided by negative slide results. Further
studies are needed to identify how this can be achieved.

Clinical case definitions and malaria vaccine efficacy.

rogerswo@namru2.org

Reported efficacies from vaccine trials may depend heavily on the clinical case
definition used in the trial. The dependence may be particularly striking for
diseases such as malaria, in which no single case definition is appropriate. We
used logistic regression modeling of the relationship between parasitemia and
fever in data sets from Ghanaian children to determine the fraction of fevers
attributable to malaria and to model how the choice of a threshold parasitemia in
the clinical case definition affects the measured efficacy of malaria vaccines.
Calculated clinical attack rates varied 10-fold as a function of the threshold
parasitemia. Strikingly, measured vaccine efficacies in reducing clinical malaria
depended heavily on the threshold parasitemia, varying between 20% and 80% as the
threshold varied between 1 and 5000 parasites/ microL. We suggest that clinical
case definitions of malaria that incorporate a threshold parasitemia are
arbitrary and do not yield stable estimates of vaccine trial end points.

A case-control study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the combination of
chloroquine plus proguanil as malaria prophylaxis in a non-immune population
living in the Central African Republic. Cases were patients presenting with a
malaria attack confirmed by a positive blood film and/or an HRP2 positive antigen
test at the Pasteur Institute of Bangui. Two control subjects were included per
case: one was a relative or close friend and the other was matched to the patient
with respect to the length of stay. A questionnaire assessing malaria prophylaxis
habits and malarial risk factors over the 2-month period prior to inclusion in
the study was given to 48 cases and 96 controls. A conditional logistic
regression was used to identify risk factors. The efficacy of the chloroquine
plus proguanil regimen was found to be high (95.5%, 95% CI 74.0-99.2%) in this
country known for high chloroquine resistance. Our data lend some support to the 
use of chloroquine plus proguanil in Bangui, and the protective efficacy of
chloroquine plus proguanil should now be studied prospectively as part of a
randomised controlled trial of various prophylactic drugs.

in Kenya.

Author information:

BACKGROUND: It has been hypothesized that the African alleles Sl2 and McCb of the
Swain-Langley (Sl) and McCoy (McC) blood group antigens of the complement
receptor 1 (CR1) may confer a survival advantage in the setting of Plasmodium
falciparum malaria, but this has not been demonstrated.
METHODS: To test this hypothesis, children in western Kenya with severe
malaria-associated anaemia or cerebral malaria were matched to symptomatic
uncomplicated malaria controls by age and gender. Swain-Langley and McCoy blood
group alleles were determined by restriction fragment length polymorphism and
conditional logistic regression was carried out.
RESULTS: No significant association was found between the African alleles and
severe malaria-associated anaemia. However, children with Sl2/2 genotype were
less likely to have cerebral malaria (OR = 0.17, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.72, P = 0.02)
than children with Sl1/1. In particular, individuals with Sl2/2 McC(a/b) genotype
were less likely to have cerebral malaria (OR = 0.18, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.77, P =
0.02) than individuals with Sl1/1 McC(a/a).
CONCLUSION: These results support the hypothesis that the Sl2 allele and,
possibly, the McCb allele evolved in the context of malaria transmission and that
in certain combinations probably confer a survival advantage on these
populations.

BACKGROUND: Acute malaria has been associated with a decreased antibody response 
to tetanus and diphtheria toxoids, meningococcal, salmonella, and Hib vaccines.
Interest in giving malaria drug therapy and prevention at the time of childhood
immunizations has increased greatly following recent trials of intermittent
preventive therapy during infancy (IPTi), stimulating this re-analysis of
unpublished data. The effect of malaria chemoprophylaxis on vaccine response was 
studied following administration of measles vaccines and diphtheria-tetanus-whole
cell pertussis (DTP) vaccines.
METHODS: In 1975, six villages divided into two groups of children < or = 74
months of age from Burkina Faso, were assigned to receive amodiaquine
hydrochloride chemoprophylaxis (CH+) every two weeks for seven months or no
chemoprophylaxis (CH-). After five months, children in each group received either
one dose of measles or two doses of DTP vaccines.
RESULTS: For recipients of the measles vaccine, the seroconversion rates in CH+
and CH- children, respectively, were 93% and 96% (P > 0.05). The seroresponse
rates in CH+ and CH- children respectively, were 73% and 86% for diphtheria (P > 
0.05) and 77% and 91% for tetanus toxoid (P > 0.05). In a subset analysis, in
which only children who strictly adhered to chemoprophylaxis criteria were
included, there were, likewise, no significant differences in seroconversion or
seroresponse for measles, diphtheria, or tetanus vaccines (P > 0.05). While
analysis for pertussis showed a 43% (CH+) and 67% (CH-) response (P < 0.05),
analyses using logistic regression to control for sex, age, chemoprophylaxis,
weight-for-height Z-score, and pre-vaccination geometric mean titer (GMT),
demonstrated that chemoprophylaxis was not associated with a significantly
different conversion rate following DTP and measles vaccines. Seven months of
chemoprophylaxis decreased significantly the malaria IFA and ELISA GMTs in the
CH+ group.
CONCLUSION: Malaria chemoprophylaxis prior to vaccination in malaria endemic
settings did not improve or impair immunogenicity of DTP and measles vaccines.
This is the first human study to look at the association between malaria
chemoprophylaxis and the serologic response to whole-cell pertussis vaccine.

Maternal malaria and gravidity interact to modify infant susceptibility to
malaria.

Mutabingwa TK(1), Bolla MC, Li JL, Domingo GJ, Li X, Fried M, Duffy PE.

Author information:

Seattle, Washington, USA.

BACKGROUND: In endemic areas, placental malaria due to Plasmodium falciparum is
most frequent and severe in first-time mothers, and increases the risk of infant 
mortality in their offspring. Placental malaria may increase the susceptibility
of infants to malaria parasitemia, but evidence for this effect is inconclusive.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: During 2002-2004, we monitored parasitemia in 453 infants, 
including 69 who were born to mothers with placental malaria, in a region of
northeastern Tanzania where malaria transmission is intense. We used a Cox
proportional hazards model to evaluate the time from birth to first parasitemia, 
and a generalized estimating equations logistic regression model to evaluate risk
of any parasitemia throughout the first year of life. Compared with infants whose
mothers did not have placental malaria at delivery ("PM-negative"), offspring of 
mothers with placental malaria at delivery ("PM-positive") were 41% more likely
to experience their first parasitemia at a younger age (adjusted hazard ratio
[AHR] = 1.41, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-1.99). The odds of parasitemia
throughout infancy were strongly modified by the interaction between placental
malaria and gravidity (p for interaction = 0.008, Type 3 likelihood ratio test). 
Offspring of PM-negative primigravidae had lower odds of parasitemia during
infancy (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.67, 95% CI 0.50-0.91) than offspring of
PM-negative multigravidae, and offspring of PM-positive primigravidae had the
lowest odds (AOR = 0.21, 95% CI 0.09-0.47). In contrast, offspring of PM-positive
multigravidae had significantly higher odds of parasitemia (AOR = 1.59, 95% CI
1.16-2.17).
CONCLUSION: Although parasitemia is more frequent in primigravid than multigravid
women, the converse is true in their offspring, especially in offspring of
PM-positive women. While placental malaria is known to increase mortality risk
for first-born infants, it surprisingly reduced their risk of parasitemia in this
study. Placental malaria of multigravidae, on the other hand, is a strong risk
factor for parasitemia during infancy, and therefore preventive antimalarial
chemotherapy administered to multigravid women close to term may reduce the
frequency of parasitemia in their offspring.

travelers with Plasmodium falciparum malaria.

Diseases, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.

BACKGROUND: Rapid immunochromatographic dipstick assays are used increasingly in 
many tropical and Western countries as a tool to diagnose Plasmodium falciparum
malaria. However, these tests do not provide any information about the severity
of the infection. We evaluated the usefulness of plasma lactate as a parameter
for disease severity on admission in imported P. falciparum malaria.
METHODS: In a cohort of 61 nonimmune travelers with imported P. falciparum
malaria, plasma lactate levels on admission were related to the severity of the
infection. Results from 12 of 61 patients fulfilled the criteria of severe
malaria.
RESULTS: Logistic regression analysis showed that a plasma lactate level above
the upper range of normal was associated with an odds ratio of 31 (95% CI 6-164) 
for severe malaria. As a continuous variable, a 1 mmol/L increase in plasma
lactate level was associated with an odds ratio of 12 (95% CI 3-50) for severe
malaria. The sensitivity of an increased plasma lactate level on admission for
severe malaria was 67% with a specificity of 94%.
CONCLUSIONS: A timely determination of plasma lactate on admission may be helpful
in the assessment of disease severity in travelers with imported P. falciparum
malaria. An increased plasma lactate level should raise suspicion of a severe P. 
falciparum malaria infection, in particular when concomitant infections are not
considered likely.

Physico-chemical characteristics of Anopheles culicifacies and Anopheles varuna
breeding water in a dry zone stream in Sri Lanka.

Piyaratne MK(1), Amerasinghe FP, Amerasinghe PH, Konradsen F.

Author information: 
(1)International Water Management Institute, PO Box 2075, Colombo, Sri Lanka.

BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Selected physico-chemical characteristics of flowing and
pooled water in a stream that generated two malaria vectors, Anopheles
culicifacies s.l. Giles and Anopheles varuna Iyengar, were investigated during
August-September 1997 and July 1998 at the Upper Yan Oya watershed in
north-central Sri Lanka.
METHODS: The physico-chemical parameters measured were: temperature, dissolved
oxygen, pH, conductivity, total dissolved solids, alkalinity, ammonia nitrogen,
nitrate nitrogen, calcium, magnesium, carbondioxide, ferrous iron, phosphate,
colour and turbidity. In total, 75.5% of 151 samples analysed were
mosquito-positive. Logistic regression was used for statistical analysis.
RESULTS: Among physico-chemical parameters, An. culicifacies (the major malaria
vector in the country) was positively related only to temperature, and An. varuna
(a secondary malaria vector) to calcium. Among habitat characteristics, An.
culicifacies was associated with light and vegetation, and negatively associated 
with the presence of potential predators. An. varuna was positively associated
with other aquatic fauna.
INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Surprisingly this detailed study did not find an
association between An. culicifacies and dissolved oxygen as previously found in 
the few studies that have looked at physico-chemical characteristics of malaria
vector breeding habitats in south Asia. This study, along with existing
information from other studies indicate that most of the physico-chemical
parameters measured under natural conditions within the same habitat type is
insufficient to explain the distribution of vectors within such habitats.
However, it seems likely that both An. culicifacies and An. varuna follow a
strategy whereby ovipositing females scatter their eggs over most of or all of a 
highly temporary and only transiently available stream bed pool habitat, in order
to optimise breeding success.

The pesticide p,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and its persistent
metabolite p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) are associated with
negative reproductive outcomes in animals. In humans, however, the findings are
inconsistent. Using data from the Child Health and Development Studies, a
longitudinal study of 20,754 pregnancies among San Francisco Bay Area women from 
1959 to 1967, the authors examined the effects of maternal serum DDT and DDE
concentrations on preterm birth, small-for-gestational-age birth, birth weight,
and gestational age in 420 male subjects. Data were analyzed using multivariate
logistic regression for preterm and small-for-gestational-age birth and linear
regression for birth weight and gestational age. Median serum concentrations of
DDE were 43 mug/liter (interquartile range: 32-57; range: 7-153) and of DDT were 
11 mug/liter (interquartile range: 8-16; range: 3-72), several times higher than 
current US concentrations. The adjusted odds ratio for preterm birth was 1.28
(95% confidence interval (CI): 0.73, 2.23) for DDE and 0.94 (95% CI: 0.50, 1.78) 
for DDT. For small-for-gestational-age birth, the adjusted odds ratio was 0.75
(95% CI: 0.44, 1.26) for DDE and 0.69 (95% CI: 0.73, 1.27) for DDT; none of the
study results achieved statistical significance. Given the persistence of DDT in 
the environment and its continuing role in malaria control, studies using more
robust data should continue to assess this relation.

Genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2) and 
its effect on the performance of PfHRP2-based rapid diagnostic tests.

Institute, Brisbane, Australia.

Rising costs of antimalarial agents are increasing the demand for accurate
diagnosis of malaria. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) offer great potential to
improve the diagnosis of malaria, particularly in remote areas. Many RDTs are
based on the detection of Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein (PfHRP) 2,
but reports from field tests have questioned their sensitivity and reliability.
We hypothesize that the variability in the results of PfHRP2-based RDTs is
related to the variability in the target antigen. We tested this hypothesis by
examining the genetic diversity of PfHRP2, which includes numerous amino acid
repeats, in 75 P. falciparum lines and isolates originating from 19 countries and
testing a subset of parasites by use of 2 PfHRP2-based RDTs. We observed
extensive diversity in PfHRP2 sequences, both within and between countries.
Logistic regression analysis indicated that 2 types of repeats were predictive of
RDT detection sensitivity (87.5% accuracy), with predictions suggesting that only
84% of P. falciparum parasites in the Asia-Pacific region are likely to be
detected at densities < or = 250 parasites/microL. Our data also indicated that
PfHRP3 may play a role in the performance of PfHRP2-based RDTs. These findings
provide an alternative explanation for the variable sensitivity in field tests of
malaria RDTs that is not due to the quality of the RDTs.

In this note we extend the logistic regression receiver operating characteristic 
(ROC) analysis framework to diagnosing disease that can be classified in a 2 x 2 
factorial setting. Similar to the standard ROC curve analysis these new models
accommodate prediction of cross-classifications for treatment success and
diagnosis of disease. A didactic example is given for jointly diagnosing malaria 
positive and respiratory distress in children in Ghana.

Malaria infection and life-style factors among hilltribes along the Thai-Myanmar 
border area, northern Thailand.

Bangkok, Thailand.

A cross sectional study was conducted between January, 2001 and June, 2002 to
determine the life-style factors associated with malaria infection among
hilltribes in the Chiang Rai Province, Mae Fah Luang district located along the
Thai-Myanmar border, northern Thailand. The data collected were a thick blood
film examination and a face-to-face interview using a local language interviewer 
at a mobile clinic or a home visit. The chi-square test, odds ratio, 95%
confidence interval and multiple logistic regression were used as data analysis. 
P. vivax (61.3%) was detected more than P falciparum (38.2%). Parasitic infection
was seen in 45.8% of a total of 417 blood examinations. The study area was in a
valley covered with forests and small streams, which was ideal for a malaria
epidemic. The communities were distributed along different ethnic groups. There
were 12 ethnic groups, dominated by the Muser, Eko, and Akha tribes (60-70%). The
risk factors included living or working in the forest, accompanying their family 
during movement through the forest, age < or =14 years (40.9%), poor knowledge of
how to protect against malaria (75-80%), and unavailability of protection against
malaria via long sleeved clothes, topical repellents, and insecticide treated
nets (use and carry), which resulted in an increased exposure to malaria and risk
for malaria infection.

Case definitions of clinical malaria under different transmission conditions in
Kilifi District, Kenya.

Coast/Wellcome Trust Collaborative Program, Kenya. tmwangi@kilifi.mimcom.net

BACKGROUND: Clear case definitions of malaria are an essential means of
evaluating the effectiveness of present and proposed interventions in malaria.
The clinical signs of malaria are nonspecific, and parasitemia accompanied by a
fever may not be sufficient to define an episode of clinical malaria in endemic
areas. We defined and quantified cases of malaria in people of different age
groups from 2 areas with different rates of transmission of malaria.
METHODS: A total of 1602 people were followed up weekly for 2 years, and all the 
cases of fever accompanied by parasitemia were identified. Logistic regression
methods were used to derive case definitions of malaria.
RESULTS: Two case definitions of malaria were derived: 1 for children 1-14 years 
old and 1 for infants (<1 year old) and older children and adults (> or =15 years
old). We also found a higher number of episodes of clinical malaria per person
per year in people from an area of low transmission of malaria, compared with the
number of episodes in those from an area of higher transmission (0.84 vs. 0.55
episodes/person/year; incidence rate ratio, 0.66 [95% confidence interval,
0.61-0.72]; P<.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Case definitions of malaria are bound to be altered by factors that 
affect immunity, such as age and transmission. Case definitions may, however, be 
affected by other immunity-altering factors, such as HIV and vaccination status, 
and this needs to be borne in mind during vaccine trials.

The sickle cell trait (HbAS) protects against severe Plasmodium falciparum
malaria in young African children. We investigated the extent of the association 
between HbAS and antibodies directed to parasite-derived variant surface antigens
(VSAs) on the membrane of infected erythrocytes. We measured immunoglobulin G
(IgG) responses with specificity for VSAs of 2 heterologous parasite isolates in 
458 Gabonese children aged between 6 months and 11 years. Logistic regression
analyses showed a highly significant independent association (P<.001) between
carriage of HbAS and the presence of IgG anti-VSA responses; this association was
related specifically to IgG1 and IgG4 subclasses in the anti-VSA profile. IgG2
and IgG3 anti-VSA responses were both independently associated with older age,
consistent with the pattern observed in semi-immune adults. The results imply
that enhanced levels of cross-reactive anti-VSA responses in children with HbAS
may be intimately associated with the protection they have against malaria.

The prevalences of malarial parasitaemia, fever, splenomegaly and anaemia and the
levels of parasitaemia were investigated, through part of one wet season (in
2001) and the following dry season (in 2002), in 2157 subjects in the village of 
Bolifamba, in south-western Cameroon. Overall, 55.9% of the villagers checked in 
the wet season but only 49.5% of those examined in the dry season were found
smear-positive for malaria (P<0.0001). Rainfall was found to be significantly
associated with the mean level of parasitaemia (P=0.001). The prevalences of
fever (40.3% v. 19.6%), splenomegaly (37.4% v. 4.0%) and marked splenomegaly
(i.e. a Hackett's score of 2 or higher; 25.8% v. 2.4%) were all significantly
higher in the wet season than in the dry (P<0.0001 for each). No seasonal
difference was observed, however, in the prevalence of anaemia. Parasitaemia,
fever, splenomegaly and anaemia were all significantly more common in the young
children investigated (i.e. those aged < 5 years) than in the older subjects.
When the data were subjected to a multiple logistic regression, age-group,
anaemia, fever, and month of examination were all found to be significantly
associated with the presence of malarial parasitaemia. The results of this
large-scale study, the first of its kind in the Buea district of Cameroon,
indicate the intense transmission of malarial parasites in rural Bolifamba, with 
young children at greatest risk. The data collected provide a useful 'base line' 
for an ongoing study to assess the immune status of the residents of Bolifamba.

CONTEXT: There are concerns that malaria control measures such as use of
insecticide-treated bed nets, by delaying acquisition of immunity, might result
in an increase in the more severe manifestations of malaria. An understanding of 
the relationships among the level of exposure to Plasmodium falciparum, age, and 
severity of malaria can provide evidence of whether this is likely.
OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical manifestations and case fatality of severe P 
falciparum malaria at varying altitudes resulting in varying levels of
transmission.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: A total of 1984 patients admitted for severe
malaria to 10 hospitals serving populations living at levels of transmission
varying from very low (altitude >1200 m) to very high (altitude <600 m) in a
defined area of northeastern Tanzania, studied prospectively from February 2002
to February 2003. Data were analyzed in a logistic regression model and adjusted 
for potential clustering within hospitals.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Specific syndromes of severe malaria; mortality.
RESULTS: The median age of patients was 1 year in high transmission, 3 years in
moderate transmission, and 5 years in low transmission areas. The odds of severe 
malarial anemia (hemoglobin <5 g/dL) peaked at 1 year of age at high transmission
and at 2 years at moderate and low transmission intensities and then decreased
with increasing age (P = .002). Odds were highest in infants (0-1 year: referent;
2-4 years: odds ratio [OR], 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72-0.96), 5 to 
<15 years: OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.27-0.72; > or =15 years: OR, 0.44; 95% CI,
0.27-0.73; P<.001) and high transmission intensity areas (altitude <600 m:
referent; 600 m to 1200 m: OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.35-0.84; >1200 m: OR, 0.55; 95%
CI, 0.26-1.15; P for trend = .03). The odds of cerebral malaria were
significantly higher in low transmission intensity areas (altitude of residence
<600 m: referent; 600 m to 1200 m: OR, 3.17; 95% CI, 1.32-7.60; >1200 m: OR,
3.76; 95% CI, 1.96-7.18; P for trend = .003) and with age 5 years and older (0-1 
year: referent; 2-4 years: OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 0.82-2.99; 5 to <15 years: OR, 6.07;
95% CI, 2.98-12.38; > or =15 years: OR, 6.24; 95% CI, 3.47-11.21; P<.001). The
overall case-fatality rate of 7% (139 deaths) was similar at high and moderate
levels of transmission but increased to 13% in low transmission areas (P = .03), 
an increase explained by the increase in the proportion of cases with cerebral
malaria.
CONCLUSIONS: Age and level of exposure independently influence the clinical
presentation of severe malaria. Our study suggests that an increase in the
proportion of cases with more fatal manifestations of severe malaria is likely to
occur only after transmission has been reduced to low levels where the overall
incidence is likely to be low.

Plasma concentrations of soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor
are increased in patients with malaria and are associated with a poor clinical or
a fatal outcome.

BACKGROUND: Blood concentrations of soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator 
receptor (suPAR) are increased in conditions with immune activation, and high
concentrations of suPAR often predict a poor clinical outcome. This study
explored the hypothesis that high plasma concentrations of suPAR are associated
with disease severity in malaria.
METHODS: At admission to the hospital, plasma concentrations of suPAR were
measured by ELISA in samples from 645 African children with clinical symptoms of 
malaria: 478 had malaria, and 167 had a blood film negative for Plasmodium
parasites. Fourteen healthy children were included for comparison.
RESULTS: Plasma concentrations of suPAR were higher in patients with malaria
(median, 7.90 ng/mL [interquartile range [IQR], 6.56-9.15 ng/mL]), compared with 
those in plasmodium-negative patients (median, 5.59 ng/mL [IQR, 4.54-8.16 ng/mL];
P < .001) and those in healthy children (3.94 ng/mL [IQR, 3.46-4.82 ng/mL]; P <
.001). The highest concentrations were found in patients with malaria who died (P
= .008) or had complicated malaria (P < .001). In univariate logistic regression 
analysis, a 1 ng/mL increase in plasma concentration of suPAR was associated with
increased risk of mortality (odds ratio, 1.42 [95% confidence interval,
1.09-1.86]; P = .009). In multivariate linear regression analysis, lower platelet
count, lower hemoglobin level, and higher neutrophil count were independently
associated with a higher plasma concentration of suPAR.
CONCLUSIONS: If the plasma concentration of suPAR reflects the extent of
parasite-induced immune activation, this may explain why a high concentration of 
suPAR is associated with a poor clinical outcome in patients with malaria.

Association of Plasmodium falciparum isolates encoding the p. Falciparum
chloroquine resistance transporter gene K76T polymorphism with anemia and

The aim of the study was to assess whether infections with Plasmodium falciparum 
isolates encoding the P. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt)
gene K76T polymorphism, a molecular marker for chloroquine resistance, are
associated with multiple infections, age, or clinical signs of malaria in a
semi-immune population in a holoendemic area of Burkina Faso. The parameters of
interest were investigated in 210 P. falciparum-positive inhabitants. Logistic
regression analysis showed that pfcrt K76T-carrying isolates are significantly
more likely to cause anemia and splenomegaly. Furthermore, we found that
infections with P. falciparum isolates encoding pfcrt K76T are dependent on age
rather than multiple infections. Our findings suggest that pfcrt K76T might serve
as a valuable marker for assessing the long-term clinical effect of chronic
infections with chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum isolates in populations,
without the need of drug efficacy trials.

Socio-economic and geographic differentials in costs and payment strategies for
primary healthcare services in Southeast Nigeria.

The study explored socio-economic and geographic inequalities that exist in
healthcare seeking, expenditures and methods of paying for healthcare. The study 
was conducted in two communities (one rural and urban) in Southeast Nigeria. A
pre-tested questionnaire was administered to household heads or their
representatives by trained interviewers. A socio-economic status (SES) index,
together with urban-rural comparisons was used to examine the inequalities. The
expenditures on healthcare and the proportions of respondents that used the
different payment strategies were compared across SES quartiles and between the
urban and rural areas. There were varying degrees of socio-economic and
geographic inequalities in treatment expenditures, providers seen and payment
modalities that were used. User fee without reimbursement was the commonest type 
of payment strategy, followed distantly by instalment payment. The two poorest
quartiles were less likely to have used user fee and they mostly used instalment 
payment in the rural area. Logistic regression analysis showed that location was 
significantly and positively related to user fee but not to instalment payment.
In conclusion, the poorest SES group and rural dwellers are the major sufferers
of inequality and this could be mitigated through improved provision of primary
healthcare services in rural areas and initiation of exemptions, vouchers and
other pro-poor payment strategies for the poorest SES groups.

et de la Recherche Médicale U.399, Faculty of Medicine, Université de la
Méditerranée, Marseilles, France. stephane.ranque@medecine.univ-mrs.fr

BACKGROUND: The predominant manifestations of severe malaria in African children 
are cerebral malaria (CM) and severe malarial anemia (SMA). As a first step
toward a family-based approach to identify the environmental and genetic pathways
that contribute to severe malaria, we tested whether it aggregates within
families.
METHODS: Family history of severe malaria was explored during face-to-face
interviews with parents. Logistic regression was used to determine whether CM and
SMA aggregate within individuals and within families. The pattern of familial
aggregation was then expressed as familial odds ratios that were adjusted for
relevant risk factors.
RESULTS: This study was of 2811 inhabitants of Bamako, Mali, clustered in 407
nuclear families. The probands were 136 children with severe malaria and 271
healthy children from the community. Within-person association of CM and SMA was 
significant (odds ratio, 6.15 [95% confidence interval (CI), 2.62-14.41]). Over a
lifetime, with each additional affected relative, the odds of a person
contracting CM increased by 1.98 times (95% CI, 1.59-2.45), and the odds of
having SMA increased by 1.91 times (95% CI, 1.05-3.47). Over a lifetime, for a
child whose sibling had a history of CM, the odds of having CM were 2.49 times
greater (95% CI, 1.51-4.10) than the odds for a child whose sibling had no such
history; for a child whose sibling had a history of SMA, the odds of having SMA
were 4.92 times greater (95% CI, 1.21-19.9) than the odds for a child whose
sibling had no such history.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest strong familial aggregation of CM and SMA.

INTRODUCTION: By 2030, more than 50% of the African population will live in urban
areas. Controlling malaria reduces the disease burden and further improves
economic development. As a complement to treated nets and prompt access to
treatment, measures targeted against the larval stage of Anopheles sp. mosquitoes
are a promising strategy for urban areas. However, a precise knowledge of the
geographic location and potentially of ecological characteristics of breeding
sites is of major importance for such interventions.
METHODS: In total 151 km2 of central Dar es Salaam, the biggest city of Tanzania,
were systematically searched for open mosquito breeding sites. Ecologic
parameters, mosquito larvae density and geographic location were recorded for
each site. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the key ecological 
factors explaining the different densities of mosquito larvae.
RESULTS: A total of 405 potential open breeding sites were examined. Large
drains, swamps and puddles were associated with no or low Anopheles sp. larvae
density. The probability of Anopheles sp. larvae to be present was reduced when
water was identified as "turbid". Small breeding sites were more commonly
colonized by Anopheles sp. larvae. Further, Anopheles gambiae s.l. larvae were
found in highly organically polluted habitats.
CONCLUSIONS: Clear ecological characteristics of the breeding requirements of
Anopheles sp. larvae could not be identified in this setting. Hence, every
stagnant open water body, including very polluted ones, have to be considered as 
potential malaria vector breeding sites.

To study the risk factors for Plasmodium vivax gametocyte carriage, the presence 
or absence of gametocytes was determined in 2,125 patients with P. vivax malaria 
participating in clinical trials at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in
Bangkok, Thailand. Stepwise logistic regression models were used to determine
which variables were significantly related to gametocyte carriage. On admission, 
615 patients (29%) had detectable gametocytes (before treatment). After treatment
had started, an additional 245 patients (11%) developed patent gametocytemia. The
variables retained by multivariate analysis were highest observed temperature
(adjusted odds ratio [AOR] per degrees C increase = 0.82, 95% confidence interval
[CI] = 0.71-0.94, P = 0.006), asexual parasitemia > 9,200/muL (AOR = 2.8, 95% CI 
= 1.9-4.2, P < 0.0001), erythrocyte counts (AOR = 0.8/million/muL increase, 95%
CI = 0.67-0.95, P = 0.01), monocyte percentage (AOR = 0.93 per % increase, 95% CI
= 0.89-0.96, P < 0.0001), lymphocyte percentage (AOR = 0.98 per % increase, 95%
CI = 0.97-0.99, P = 0.006), albumin (AOR = 0.67 per 10 g/mL increase, 95% CI =
0.5-0.9, P = 0.007), and anion gap (AOR = 1.1 per unit increase, 95% CI =
1.02-1.14, P = 0.009). The possible significance of these observations is
discussed.

Knowledge of malaria influences the use of insecticide treated nets but not
intermittent presumptive treatment by pregnant women in Tanzania.

BACKGROUND: To reduce the intolerable burden of malaria in pregnancy, the
Ministry of Health in Tanzania has recently adopted a policy of intermittent
presumptive treatment for pregnant women using sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine
(IPTp-SP). In addition, there is strong national commitment to increase
distribution of insecticide treated nets (ITNs) among pregnant women. This study 
explores the determinants of uptake for both ITNs and IPTp-SP by pregnant women
and the role that individual knowledge and socio-economic status has to play for 
each.
METHODS: 293 women were recruited post-partum at Kibaha District Hospital on the 
East African coast. The haemoglobin level of each woman was measured and a
questionnaire administered.
RESULTS: Use of both interventions was associated with a reduced risk of severe
anaemia (Hb<8 g/dL) compared to women who had used neither intervention (OR 0.31,
95% CI 0.14-0.67). In a logistic regression model it was found that attendance at
MCH health education sessions was the only factor that predicted IPTp-SP use (OR 
1.8, 95% CI 1.1-2.9) while high knowledge of malaria predicted use of ITNs (OR
2.3, 95% CI 1.1-4.9).
CONCLUSION: Individual knowledge of malaria was an important factor for ITN
uptake, but not for IPTp-SP use, which was reliant on delivery of information by 
MCH systems. When both these interventions were used, severe anaemia postpartum
was reduced by 69% compared to use of neither, thus providing evidence of
effectiveness of these interventions when used in combination.

In 2000, 22,000 French military personnel were deployed overseas. The French
military health service implemented a vector control strategy including personal 
protection by the use of permethrin preimpregnated battlefield uniforms (BFUs)
and the application on the skin of a topical repellent (50% DEET). In 2000,
French forces used an industrial process to impregnate cloth with permethrin by
soaking it before cut-out of the BFU. A study was implemented in four
experimental huts in Côte d'Ivoire to assess the field efficacy of the
impregnated BFUs and their resistance to washing. Taking into account the
systematic variations in each variable in the field and using a modeling based on
logistic regression and discriminant analysis, this study showed that after 6 h
without reapplication, the protective effects of the use of DEET as skin
repellent was not significant, perhaps due to the high density of Anopheles
mosquitoes during the night catching sessions and an average time of effective
repellency of < 2 or 3 h in the field. The analysis also showed that the French
process of industrial impregnation of permethrin of the BFU offered in 2000 some 
protection from mosquito bites but not enough to reduce significantly the
incidence of malaria among nonimmune troops. No positive or negative interaction 
was noted when DEET and the impregnated BFUs were used together.

Reduced case fatality among hospitalized children during a war in Guinea-Bissau: 
a lesson in equity.

BACKGROUND: During a recent armed conflict in Guinea-Bissau, we observed a marked
decline in the case fatality among hospitalized children at the only paediatric
department in the country.
AIM: To analyse the causes behind the observed fall in case fatality.
MATERIAL: All children hospitalized at the only paediatric department in the
capital of Guinea-Bissau. The war cohort comprised all children hospitalized
during the war, which lasted from June 1998 to May 1999, and the peace cohort
comprised all children hospitalized in the year preceding the war. As part of a
longitudinal community study, we also registered all children being hospitalized 
from the Bandim Health Project's study area, including routinely collected
information on socio-economic background factors.
METHODS: The war cohort was compared with the peace cohort in terms of
determinants for hospital case fatality. Through information in the community
register, we examined post-hospital mortality in the 2 wk after discharge as well
as socio-economic differences in recruitment during the war. Hospital case
fatality was estimated by odds ratios and compared by multiple logistic
regression. Community mortality risk was estimated by deaths per person years.
RESULTS: The case fatality among children aged 0-14 y fell during the war
(age-adjusted OR = 0.58; 95% CI: 0.50-0.68). There was a uniform reduction in
case fatality among children hospitalized less than 7 d, while we observed no
decline among children hospitalized longer. There were more children per bed
during the war and mean hospitalization time was shorter, and post-discharge
mortality also fell (mortality ratio (MR) = 0.57; 95% CI: 0.40-0.83). Adjustment 
for socio-economic confounders in recruitment during the war period made no
difference to the estimated decline in case fatality. The decline in case
fatality at the hospital was not explained by a general decline in mortality.
Compared with the preceding year, the mortality ratio was 1.34 (1.20-1.51) in the
Bandim Health Project's study area during the war. Adjusted for age, the decline 
in case fatality at the hospital was most marked for disadvantaged groups. For
example, the general reduction in case fatality was 42% (95% CI: 11-63); however,
children of mothers without any schooling experienced a reduction of 73% (95% CI:
27-90%), whereas the reduction was only 33% (95% CI: 14-61%) for children of
mothers with school education.
CONCLUSION: The decline in case fatality could be explained neither by a general 
decline in childhood mortality nor by changes in recruitment or discharge policy.
The decline was therefore most likely due to improved treatment as a result of
better availability of drugs funded by humanitarian aid and the presence of
dedicated staff, which was offered relief food as compensation. Interventions
improving case management may have a proportionately larger effect for poor
families.

& NIMR Headquarters, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. jpalusingu@yahoo.co.uk

BACKGROUND: The relationship between the burden of uncomplicated malaria and
transmission intensity is unclear and a better understanding of this relationship
is important for the implementation of intervention programmes.
METHODS: A 6-month longitudinal study monitoring risk factors for anaemia and
febrile malaria episodes was conducted among individuals aged below 20 years,
residing in three villages of different altitude in areas of high, moderate and
low malaria transmission intensity in North-Eastern Tanzania.
RESULTS: The burden of anaemia and malarial fever fell mainly on the youngest
children and was highest in the village with high transmission intensity.
Although a considerable percentage of individuals in all villages carried
intestinal worms, logistic regression models indicated that Plasmodium falciparum
was the only significant parasitic determinant of anaemia. Interestingly,
children who carried low-density parasitaemia at the start of the study had a
lower risk of contracting a febrile malaria episode but a higher risk of anaemia 
during the study period, than children who were slide negative at this point in
time.
CONCLUSION: Young children living in the high transmission village carried a very
high anaemia burden, which could be attributed to malaria. The overall incidence 
of febrile malaria was also highest in the high transmission village particularly
among those under five years of age. These data suggest that in rolling back
malaria, available resources in prevention programmes should primarily be
focussed on young children, particularly those residing in areas of high malaria 
transmission.

Bangkok, Thailand.

A population based case-control study was performed to determine factors
associated with malaria infection among the migrant population, foreign nationals
aged 15 years or over. Data were obtained from 217 malaria and 217 non-malaria
patients attending the Vector-Borne Disease Control Units 6-9 (Thong Pha Phum and
Sangkhla Buri districts) in Kanchanaburi Province and at the Vector-Borne Disease
Control Units 1,9 (Mae Fa Luang and Mae Sai districts) in Chiang Rai Province,
between June and December 2002. All study subjects were interviewed by trained
interviewers using a structured interview form. The statistical analysis was
carried out by the chi-square test and multivariate logistic regression: a
p-value of less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. The
results showed that the study subjects were predominantly Thai-Yai and Myanmar.
Plasmodium falciparum was the major type of the malaria (60.8%). Logistic
regression analysis, controlling for possible confounding factors, revealed that 
residence located in the forest increased the risk of malaria infection by a
factor of 6.29 (OR = 6.29, 95% CI = 1.56-25.42); outdoor stay < 7 and > 7 days
prior to the blood examination also increased the risk by a factor of 4.34 and
4.13 respectively (OR = 4.34, 95% CI = 1.05-17.99; OR = 4.13, 95% CI =
1.29-13.13).

The prevalence of chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria has been
increasing in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of South America over the last 2
decades, and has been associated with increased anaemia-associated morbidity and 
higher mortality rates. Prospectively collected clinical and parasitological data
from a multicentre study of 788 children aged 6-59 months with uncomplicated P.
falciparum malaria were analysed in order to identify risk factors for
chloroquine treatment failure and to assess its impact on anaemia after therapy. 
The proportion of chloroquine treatment failures (combined early and late
treatment failures) was higher in the central-eastern African countries
(Tanzania, 53%; Uganda, 80%; Zambia, 57%) and Ecuador (54%) than in Ghana (36%). 
Using logistic regression, predictors of early treatment failure included younger
age, higher baseline temperature, and greater levels of parasitaemia. We conclude
that younger age, higher initial temperature, and higher baseline parasitaemia
predict early treatment failure and a higher probability of worsening anaemia
between admission and days 7 or 14 post-treatment.

Predictors of the quality of health worker treatment practices for uncomplicated 
malaria at government health facilities in Kenya.

BACKGROUND: When replacing failing drugs for malaria with more effective drugs,
an important step towards reducing the malaria burden is that health workers (HW)
prescribe drugs according to evidence-based guidelines. Past studies have shown
that HW commonly do not follow guidelines, yet few studies have explored with
appropriate methods why such practices occur.
METHODS: We analysed data from a survey of government health facilities in four
Kenyan districts in which HW consultations were observed, caretakers and HW were 
interviewed, and health facility assessments were performed. The analysis was
limited to children 2-59 months old with uncomplicated malaria. Treatment was
defined as recommended (antimalarial recommended by national guidelines), a minor
error (effective, but non-recommended antimalarial), or inappropriate (no
effective antimalarial).
RESULTS: We evaluated 1006 consultations performed by 135 HW at 81 facilities:
567 children received recommended treatment, 314 had minor errors, and 125
received inappropriate treatment (weighted percentages: 56.9%, 30.4%, and 12.7%).
Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that programmatic
interventions such as in-service malaria training, provision of guidelines and
wall charts, and more frequent supervision were significantly associated with
better treatment quality. However, neither in-service training nor possession of 
the guideline document showed an effect by itself. More qualified HW made more
errors: both major and minor errors (but generally more minor errors) when
second-line drugs were in stock, and more major errors when second-line drugs
were not in stock. Child factors such as age and a main complaint of fever were
also associated with treatment quality.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the use of several programmatic strategies that 
can redress HW deficiencies in malaria treatment. Targeted cost-effectiveness
trials would help refine these strategies and provide more precise guidance on
affordable and effective ways to strengthen and maintain HW practices.

The epidemiology of malaria over small areas remains poorly understood, and this 
is particularly true for malaria during epidemics in highland areas of Africa,
where transmission intensity is low and characterized by acute within and between
year variations. We report an analysis of the spatial distribution of clinical
malaria during an epidemic and investigate putative risk factors. Active case
surveillance was undertaken in three schools in Nandi District, Western Kenya for
10 weeks during a malaria outbreak in May-July 2002. Household surveys of cases
and age-matched controls were conducted to collect information on household
construction, exposure factors and socio-economic status. Household geographical 
location and altitude were determined using a hand-held geographical positioning 
system and landcover types were determined using high spatial resolution
satellite sensor data. Among 129 cases identified during the surveillance, which 
were matched to 155 controls, we identified significant spatial clusters of
malaria cases as determined using the spatial scan statistic. Conditional
multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the risk of malaria was higher 
in children who were underweight, who lived at lower altitudes, and who lived in 
households where drugs were not kept at home.

Polymorphism of Fc receptor IIa for IgG in infants is associated with
susceptibility to perinatal HIV-1 infection.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of polymorphism of the Fc gamma receptor IIa,
which is associated with differential human IgG subclass binding, on perinatal
HIV-1 transmission.
METHODS: Fc gamma RIIa genotype was tested in 448 HIV-seropositive mothers and
their infants from a cohort study designed to assess the effect of placental
malaria on HIV vertical transmission conducted from 1996 to 2001 in western
Kenya. Fc gamma RIIa polymorphism was analyzed for associations with
susceptibility to perinatal HIV infection and all-cause child mortality in
HIV-positive children.
RESULTS: Overall, 20% of infants were perinatally infected with HIV. There was no
statistically significant association between maternal genotype and perinatal
HIV-1 transmission. However, frequency of the infant Fc gamma RIIa His/His131
genotype was higher in HIV-positive compared with HIV-negative infants (35% and
21%, respectively), whereas the distribution was reversed (15% and 28%,
respectively) for infants with the Fc gamma RIIa Arg/Arg131 genotype.
Multivariate logistic regression controlling for maternal and infant confounding 
factors demonstrated that the odds of perinatal HIV infection in infants with the
Fc gamma RIIa His/His131 versus Fc gamma RIIa His/Arg131 genotypes were
significantly higher (adjusted odds ratio, 2.22; 95% confidence interval,
1.23-4.02; P = 0.009). There was no evidence for an association between
HIV-positive child all-cause mortality and Fc gamma RIIa genotype.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first evidence that the infant Fc gamma RIIa
His/His131 genotype is associated with susceptibility to perinatal HIV-1
transmission and further suggests that there is a dose-response relationship for 
the effect of the Fc gamma RIIa His131 gene on transmission.

Diseases, Inserm U.399, Faculté de Médecine Timone, Université de la
Méditerranée, 27 Boulevard Jean Moulin, 13385 Marseille cedex 5, France.

The aim of this case-control study was to identify epidemiological risk factors
for severe malaria among children living in Bamako, a malaria-endemic area. For
this, 260 healthy community controls were matched to 130 patients with severe
malaria. Conditional multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that all
examined independent factors associated with severe malaria are directly related 
to characteristics of the child's mother, with the exception of the child's own
yellow fever vaccination history (odds ratio (OR): 1.93, 95% confidence intervals
(CI(95%)) [1.10-3.37]). The following characteristics were all associated with a 
decreased risk of severe malaria in the child: maternal education (OR: 0.52,
CI(95%) [0.31-0.86]), the mother's adequate knowledge about malaria (OR: 0.46,
95% CI(95%) [0.25-0.86]), her use of mosquito bed nets (OR: 0.53, CI(95%)
[0.30-0.92]) and breast-feeding for at least 2 years (OR: 0.57, CI(95%)
[0.33-0.94]). Conversely, chronic maternal disease (OR: ?3.16, CI(95%)
[1.31-7.61]) was associated with an increased risk of severe malaria. These
findings strongly support the hypothesis that maternal factors are central to the
development of severe malaria in children. Programmes aiming to improve both
maternal health and maternal education may reduce the incidence of severe malaria
in children and should therefore be advocated in Bamako and in areas with similar
epidemiological patterns for malaria.

Effect of topography on the risk of malaria infection in the Usambara Mountains, 
Tanzania.

Road, Durham DH1 3LE, UK.

We investigated whether the risk of infection with malaria parasites was related 
to topography in the Usambara Mountains, Tanzania. Clinical surveys were carried 
out in seven villages, situated at altitudes from 300 m to 1650 m. Each village
was mapped and incorporated into a Digital Terrain Model. Univariate analysis
showed that the risk of splenomegaly declined with increasing altitude and with
decreasing potential for water to accumulate. Logistic regression showed that
altitude alone could correctly predict 73% of households where an occupant had an
enlarged spleen or not. The inclusion of land where water is likely to accumulate
within 400 m of each household increased the accuracy of the overall model
slightly to 76%, but significantly improved predictions between 1000 m and 1200
m, where malaria is unstable, and likely to be epidemic. This novel approach
illustrates how topography could help identify local areas prone to epidemics in 
the African highlands.

Health beliefs and communication in the travel clinic consultation as predictors 
of adherence to malaria chemoprophylaxis.

Author information: 
(1)Sub-Department of Clinical Health Psychology, University College London,
London, UK.

OBJECTIVES: The objectives were, first, to determine whether adherence to malaria
prophylaxis could be predicted by (i) health beliefs specified by the Health
Belief Model and the Theory of Planned Behaviour, and (ii) communication during
the consultation in a travel clinic; and secondly, to examine the impact of the
consultation in changing travellers' health beliefs.
DESIGN: A prospective study using regression analysis.
METHODS: The participants were 130 consecutive travellers attending a travel
medicine clinic. Health beliefs were measured pre- and post-consultation. The
consultations were coded from audiotape using the Roter Interaction Analysis
System and a content analysis method recording discussion about malaria and
prophylaxis. Adherence was assessed by a follow-up telephone interview.
RESULTS: Perceived susceptibility to malaria, perceived benefits of medication
and intentions to adhere increased significantly as a result of the consultation,
and the perceived permanent nature of side effects reduced significantly. At
follow-up (N = 107), 62% reported full adherence, 25% partial adherence and 12%
poor/no adherence. A multinomial logistic regression analysis revealed that
perceived benefits of medication, length of stay, health professional discussion 
about adherence and travellers' questions and statements independently predicted 
reported adherence.
CONCLUSIONS: Health beliefs and communication significantly predicted adherence
in this setting. The findings also suggested qualitative differences between
travellers who adhered fully, partially or poorly. Although the clinic
consultation had a positive impact, emphasizing benefits of medication and
resolving potential barriers to adherence could improve adherence in the
population.

Reproductive effects of occupational DDT exposure among male malaria control
workers.

To assess potential effects of human DDT
[1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane] exposure, we evaluated the
reproductive history of 2,033 workers in the antimalaria campaign of Mexico. Data
on occupational exposure to DDT and reproductive outcomes were gathered through a
questionnaire, and workers provided information about 9,187 pregnancies. We
estimated paternal exposure to DDT before each pregnancy using three approaches: 
a) a dichotomous indicator for pregnancies before and after exposure began, b) a 
qualitative index of four exposure categories, and c) an estimation of the DDT
metabolite DDE [1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene] accumulated in fat.
To assess associations, we used logistic regression models that accounted for
correlated observations and adjusted for parents' age at each child's birth,
exposure to other pesticides, exposure to chemical substances in other
employment, smoking, and alcohol consumption. The odds ratio for birth defects
comparing pregnancies after and before the first exposure was 3.77 [95%
confidence interval (95% CI), 1.19-9.52]. Compared with the lowest quartile of
estimated DDE in fat, the ORs were 2.48 (95% CI, 0.75-8.11), 4.15 (95% CI,
1.38-12.46), and 3.76 (95% CI, 1.23-11.44) for quartiles 2, 3, and 4, equivalent 
to p,p -DDE in fat of 50, 82, and 298 microg/g fat, respectively. No significant 
association was found for spontaneous abortion or sex ratio. We found an
increased risk of birth defects associated with high occupational exposure to DDT
in this group of workers. The significance of this association at lower exposure 
levels found in the general population remains uncertain.

We conducted laboratory tests to assess the sensitivity to the insect repellent
1-piperidinecarboxylic acid, 2-(2-hydroxyethyl)-, 1-methylpropylester (known as
KBR 3023 or Picaridin, trade name Bayrepel) of West African strains of the yellow
fever mosquito Aedes aegypti and of malaria vectors of the Anopheles gambiae
complex, in comparison with the standard repellent N,N-diethyl-3-methyl-benzamide
(DEET). Test mosquitoes were exposed according to a 'separate arms' protocol to
logarithmic dose increments applied on one arm of human subjects to evaluate the 
relative potency, and the median effective dosages (ED50 and ED90). According to 
a logistic regression model fitted to the experimental data, the dose-response
relationship for the two repellents was the same within each species, thus pooled
ED values were assessed for each mosquito separately. The median ED of KBR 3023
and DEET was estimated at 0.78 (95% confidence limits (CI): 0.57-1.04) and at
0.018 microg/cm2 (0.004-0.052) for mosquitoes of the An. gambiae complex and Ae. 
aegypti, respectively. ED90 values were 125.6 (81.4-201.3) and 24.0 microg/cm2
(5.7-208.5) for An. gambiae s.l. and Ae. aegypti, respectively. The relative
potency of KBR 3023 was not significantly different from that of DEET for An.
gambiae s.l. (95% confidence limits 0.7-1.0), whereas in the case of Ae. aegypti 
it was with 95% probability 1.1-2.0 times more potent than DEET. On the basis of 
available evidence, KBR 3023 represents a promising alternative to DEET for
personal protection against bites of these important vectors of disease in the
Afrotropical region.

This study examines hematologic profiles of persons with acute Plasmodium
falciparum or P. vivax infection in Maesod on Thailand's western border with
Myanmar compared with febrile, non-parasitemic persons also reporting to malaria 
clinics. Nine hundred seventy-nine subjects were malaria-negative, 414 were
infected with P. falciparum, and 646 were infected with P. vivax. Persons with
patent parasitemia tended to have significantly lower white blood cell, red blood
cell, platelet, and hemoglobin levels than those who were malaria-negative. For
the first time, a parallel trend in thrombocytopenia with parasitemia was found
to be associated with both P. falciparum, and P. vivax infection. Using logistic 
regression, persons with platelet counts < 150,000/microL were 12-15 times more
likely to have malaria than persons with platelet counts > or = 150,000/microL.
This study supplements previous literature on the hematologic effects of malaria 
and helps define those alterations for a semi-immune population. Thrombocytopenia
is identified as a key indicator of malaria in these febrile patients.

[Pertinence of the 2000 WHO criteria in non-immune children with severe malaria
in Dakar, Senegal ].

The relevance of World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for severe malaria has 
not been assessed in non-immune children. The objectives of this study were (i)
to evaluate the significance of 1990 WHO definition reconsidered in 2000 on
distribution and lethality of severe cases in children admitted with falciparum
malaria, and (ii) to contribute to the study of relevance of the WHO severe
criteria in Dakar, an hypoendemic area in Senegal.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The 1990 
WHO criteria, respiratory distress and platelet counts were prospectively
collected in 1997-99 from children admitted to Hôpital Principal de Dakar,
Senegal, with falciparum malaria diagnosed on a thick blood film. This method
allowed also the definition of severe cases according to 2000 WHO criteria.
RESULTS: Among 311 patients (median age: 8 years old), according to the 2000 WHO 
criteria, the frequency of severe malaria cases was increased by 23% (75% versus 
52%) and case-fatality rates thereof were decreased by 5% (17% versus 12%)
compared with 1990 WHO definition. One death occurred among cases defined as
severe on admission only according to criteria modified by WHO in 2000. A
multivariate logistic regression model identified several independent prognostic 
factors: cerebral malaria, hypoglycaemia, respiratory distress, renal failure,
collapse, abnormal bleedings, pupillary abnormalities and thrombocytopaenia
defined as a platelet count below 100,000/mm3. A significant association (p <
0.001) was observed between platelet count increase and consciousness level
improvement, evaluated on day of first platelet count control (time from
admission: 1-7 d). Among survivors, a lesser improvement in coma score was
associated with a decrease in platelet counts (p < 0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: The 1990 WHO criteria, which predicted death among malaria cases in 
children living under stable falciparum transmission, are relevant in this series
of non-immune children living in a low and seasonal transmission. Nevertheless
new WHO criteria showed poor prognostic significance. However, the 2000 WHO
definition was highly sensitive to detect severe malaria cases. These findings
should be considered for managing severe malaria in migrant children.

Who buys insecticide-treated nets? Implications for increasing coverage in
Nigeria.

onwujekwe@yahoo.com

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the determinants of purchase of insecticide-treated
nets (ITNs) and explore the policy implications of the findings for ITN
programmes.
METHODS: Two surveys were conducted 1 month apart in three villages. The first
survey was used to determine stated willingness to pay (WTP) and respondent
practices regarding untreated nets and ITNs. The second survey was accompanied by
actual sales of ITNs. Pre-tested interviewer-administered questionnaires using
three contingent valuation method (CVM) question formats, namely the bidding game
(BG), binary with follow up (BWFU) and a structured haggling technique (SH), were
administered to different sub-samples of the respondents. The nets were sold at a
price of 350 Naira (US dollars 1 = 110 Naira). Bivariate analysis and logistic
regression were used to investigate the factors that explain actual WTP.
FINDINGS: While 15/158 (9.5%), 21/166 (12.7%) and 35/144 (24.3%) of the
respondents in the BG, BWFU and SH stated WTP amounts that were equal to or
greater than the price of the net, 19.6%, 24.7% and 24.3% of respondents actually
purchased the nets in the three groups respectively. Lower socioeconomic groups
were less likely to purchase the nets, while households with a recent attack of
malaria and those that stated higher WTP amounts were more likely to purchase
nets. Stated WTP was positively associated with actual WTP (p < 0.01). Increased 
distance of the respondents to the ITNs sales point decreased net purchases (p < 
0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Stated WTP was a good predictor of actual WTP. ITNs distribution
strategies that will decrease time and travel costs to households are needed to
increase net coverage. Also, ITNs financing mechanisms are needed that will
ensure that lower socioeconomic groups and those at greater risk of malaria are
protected. Governments and donors should take the lead to ensure that ITNs
programmes are equitable.

A randomized, open-label comparison of artesunate and quinine was conducted in
113 adults with clinically severe falciparum malaria in western Thailand.
Mortality was 12% with artesunate and 22% with quinine treatment (relative risk, 
0.53; 95% confidence interval, 0.23-1.26; P=.22). Multiple logistic regression
analysis found admission plasma lactate level, Glasgow Coma Scale score, and
total serum bilirubin level to be independent risk factors for death. Coma
recovery and times to normalize plasma lactate levels were similar, but the
parasite clearance time was much shorter among artesunate-treated patients
(P=.019). Fewer patients became hypoglycemic during artesunate therapy (10%) than
during quinine therapy (28%) (P=.03). Artesunate is at least as effective as
quinine in the treatment of adults with severe malaria. Larger trials are
required to determine whether mortality is reduced among patients treated with
artesunate.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the knowledge and beliefs about malaria transmission
and practices for vector control in eight villages on the coastal plain of
Chiapas, Mexico.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted during May and June 
1995 in Chiapas, Mexico. A questionnaire to investigate family structure,
knowledge on malaria transmission, preventive measures and attitudes towards
seeking treatment was applied to both family heads of a sample of households.
Associations were analyzed by estimating odds ratios with confidence intervals
and p values, using bivariate and multivariate logistic regression methods.
RESULTS: Malaria knowledge was poor and only 48% associated malaria with mosquito
bites. The perceived benefit of indoor residual spraying was associated to a
reduction of mosquitoes, a reduction in the numbers of cockroaches and rats, but 
only 3% associated it directly with the prevention of malaria transmission. Most 
villagers (97.6%) agreed with the indoor residual spraying of insecticides.
Ninety nine percent of villagers had mosquito bednets, 75.7% used them all year
round. Other measures used by villagers to prevent mosquito bites were smoke and 
mosquito coils. Above 40% of villagers self-medicated when any member of the
family had a fever episode, but 51% attended proper health services (community
dispensary, private physician, health worker). About 61% used pesticides for
agricultural or livestock purposes and 55% applied themselves. Women had a
greater participation as family health promoters, with 70% of the housewives
being in charge of the application of self-protection preventive measures.
CONCLUSIONS: Educational programs aimed at increasing awareness on the
participation of mosquitoes on malaria transmission could promote community
participation in malaria control in the region. The English version of this paper

BACKGROUND: In developing countries, health workers often do not follow clinical 
practice guidelines. However, few studies have examined why different types of
errors occur.
METHODS: We analysed a sample of consultations of children with non-severe
malaria (defined as fever without signs of severe illness) from a health facility
survey conducted in Ouémé Département, Benin. Treatment was defined as correct
(recommended antimalarial), a minor error (non-recommended antimalarial), or a
major error (no antimalarial).
RESULTS: In all, 85 health workers and 289 children were studied. In a
multivariate logistic regression analysis, the following factors were
significantly associated with major errors: treatment by a physician (adjusted
odds ratio [aOR] = 13.57, 95% CI: 1.45-126.75), child's age <12 months (aOR =
3.41, 95% CI: 1.15-10.07), and child's temperature (aOR = 0.58 per degrees C, 95%
CI: 0.34-0.97). Factors significantly associated with minor errors were: child's 
temperature (aOR = 1.43 per degrees C, 95% CI: 1.07-1.92), electricity at the
health facility (aOR = 3.10, 95% CI: 1.05-9.17), >/=1 supervision visit in the
past 6 months (aOR = 0.33, 95% CI: 0.14-0.77), fever treatment wall chart in the 
consultation room (aOR = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.12-0.73), and number of non-fever chief 
complaints (aOR = 0.67 per complaint, 95% CI: 0.48-0.93). In-service training in 
malaria treatment was not significantly associated with either error type.
CONCLUSIONS: Many factors may influence health worker performance, and factors
such as pre-service training may influence performance in unexpected ways.
Identifying different errors and analysing them separately can help reveal
potential causes that may be masked by combining errors into a single category.

Zooprophylaxis, artefact or reality? A paired-cohort study of the effect of
passive zooprophylaxis on malaria in The Gambia.

The World Health Organization has recommended the use of cattle for
zooprophylaxis as a protective measure against malaria since 1982. However,
concern has been raised about this practice, since some studies have shown that
the presence of cattle may instead increase malaria prevalence. This study was
designed to investigate the effect of passive zooprophylaxis on malaria in an
area of moderate seasonal transmission in The Gambia, West Africa. The study was 
based on a paired-cohort of 204 children aged < 7 years, sleeping < 20 m or > 50 
m from cattle, and surveys were done from 14 October to 2 December 1997.
Entomological investigations showed that the presence of cattle did not alter the
risk of malaria transmission in nearby houses. There was also no significant
difference in the prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum between the 2 groups.
Although the presence of cattle appeared to be protective against high
parasitaemia, cattle were also associated with greater wealth of the children's
families. Conditional logistic regression analysis showed that the decreased risk
of high parasitaemia in the group with cattle present was an artefact associated 
with the higher general wealth of the cattle owners. We concluded that
zooprophylaxis is not an effective intervention method against malaria in
settings similar to The Gambia.

Low plasma arginine concentrations in children with cerebral malaria and
decreased nitric oxide production.

Nitric oxide (NO) production and mononuclear cell NO synthase 2 (NOS2) expression
are high in healthy Tanzanian children but low in those with cerebral malaria.
Factors that downregulate NOS2 also diminish factors involved in cellular uptake 
and biosynthesis of L-arginine, the substrate for NO synthesis. We therefore
postulated that L-arginine concentrations would be low in individuals with
cerebral malaria. We measured concentrations of L-arginine in cryopreserved
plasma samples from Tanzanian children with and without malaria. L-arginine
concentrations were low in individuals with cerebral malaria (mean 46 micromol/L,
SD 14), intermediate in those with uncomplicated malaria (70 micromol/L, 20), and
within the normal range in healthy controls (122 micromol/L, 22; p<0.0001).
Analysis by logistic regression showed that hypoargininaemia was significantly
associated with cerebral malaria case-fatality. Hypoargininaemia may contribute
to limited NO production in children with cerebral malaria and to severe disease.

Loss of red blood cell-complement regulatory proteins and increased levels of
circulating immune complexes are associated with severe malarial anemia.

Severe anemia is one of the most lethal complications of Plasmodium falciparum
malaria. Red blood cells (RBCs) from children with severe malarial anemia are
deficient in complement regulatory proteins (CR1 and CD55). A case-control, age- 
and sex-matched study was carried out to determine whether these deficiencies are
acquired or inherited and the relative contribution of these complement
regulatory protein deficiencies, the immune complex level, and the parasite
density to the development of severe malarial anemia. RBC CR1 and CD55
deficiencies resolved after treatment, suggesting that these changes were
acquired. Using conditional logistic regression, a decline in CD55 (or CR1) (odds
ratio [OR], 4.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.1-8.1; P<.001) and an increase
in immune complex level (OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.5-4.8; P=.001) were significantly
associated with severe malarial anemia.

BACKGROUND: It is known that malnutrition in childhood interacting with
infectious diseases contributes to increase mortality. In Burkina Faso,
infectious pathologies and malnutrition are public health problems. We examined
the impact of malnutrition status, using the Weight-for-age (WA) index, on
mortality of children hospitalized for infectious diseases.
METHODS: This retrospective study uses a systematic sample derived from the year 
1999 hospital register. In total data of 1573 children from 0 to 59 months were
analyzed. The association between mortality and dependent variables was measured 
by relative risks (RR) in univariate analysis. A logistic regression was realized
and attributable risk percent (etiologic fraction among exposed) of death was
calculated.
RESULTS: The total intra-hospital lethality amounted to 15.3%. Age, diagnosis,
type of care recourse and malnutrition (low WA index) on admission were
associated to mortality. The logistic regression model confirmed the high risks
of deaths for young children (0-11m), children in malnutrition (low WA index) and
those with severe malaria. The attributable risk percent of death indicates that,
87% of deaths are statically attributable to severe malnutrition (WA Z-score<=-3)
and 64.3% of deaths are statically attributable to moderate malnutrition (WA
Z-score]-3, -2]).
CONCLUSION: Nutritional status evaluation would allow to select children at risk 
and reduce mortality by including nutritional intervention in standard treatment 
of children hospitalized for infectious diseases.

To search for evidence of a protective role of the CD23/NO pathway against
cerebral malaria, concentrations of reactive nitrogen intermediates (RNI) and
sCD21, total immunoglobulin (Ig)E and sCD23 were compared between 17 cases of
cerebral malaria and 33 controls. The geometric mean of sCD23 concentration was
higher among cerebral malaria cases than among controls (optical density
2643/1495, P = 0.01). The ratio between sCD21 and sCD23 was significantly lower
in cerebral malaria cases than in controls (0.67 +/- 0.02 versus 0.77 +/- 0.02,
respectively, P = 0.009). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that, among 
cerebral malaria cases, there was a clear correlation between RNI and both IgE (P
= 0.007) and sCD21 (P < 0.0001). Among controls, there was a strong negative
correlation between RNI and sCD23 concentrations (r = -0.61, P < 0.0001).
However, multivariate analysis unmasked the fact that, in controls, there was
also a positive correlation between RNI and IgE (P = 0.045). Logistic regression 
showed that increased RNI concentrations were associated with a cerebral malaria 
adjusted odds ratio of 1.05 per unit increase [95% confidence interval (CI)
1.006-1.1, P = 0.02] and that an increased ratio between sCD21 and sCD23 was
associated with protection from cerebral malaria (adjusted OR = 0.00001 per unit 
increase (95% CI 0-0.03, P = 0.005). These different immunological profiles
suggest that, among controls, the CD23/NO pathway was chronically stimulated
whereas, in cerebral malaria, its stimulation was acute, which could explain why 
some patients developed cerebral malaria and others did not.

The repellency of potted plants against the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae
sensu stricto Giles was quantified in experimental huts under semi-field
conditions inside a screen-walled greenhouse. Ocimum americanum Linnaeus
(Labiatae), Lantana camara L. (Verbenaceae), and Lippia uckambensis Spreng
(Verbenaceae) repelled at an average of 39.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] =
29.6-48.4%), 32.4% (95% CI = 19.7-43.1%), and 33.3% (95% CI = 21.5-43.3%) of the 
mosquitoes, respectively (P < 0.0001 for all treatments). This was determined by 
logistic regression, allowing for variations associated with different bait
hosts, sampling huts, and replicate test nights. In contrast, Ocimum
kilimandscharicum Guerke (Labiatae), Ocimum suave Willd. (Labiatae), Corymbia
citriodora Hook (Myrtaceae), Azadirachta indica A. Juss (Meliaceae), Tagetes
minuta L. (Asteraceae), and Hyptis suaveolens Poit. (Lamiaceae) did not
significantly repel mosquitoes. The combination of O. americanum with either L.
camara or L. uckambensis repelled 31.6% (95% CI = 19.7-41.7%) and 45.2% (95% CI =
34.7-54.0%) of the mosquitoes, respectively (P < 0.0001 for both treatments).
This study is the first to show that live intact plants can reduce domestic
exposure to malaria vector mosquitoes. As such, they may represent a new,
sustainable and readily applicable malaria vector control tool for incorporation 
into integrated vector management programs.

Relationship between parasite density and fever risk in a community exposed to a

To establish a simple definition of a malaria attack based on blood parasite
density and other explanatory covariates, a cohort study was conducted from 1993 
to 1996 in the Madagascar highlands undergoing a low seasonal transmission of
falciparum malaria. Using logistic regression, the explanatory variables found to
be significantly related to the risk of fever are parasite density, age, season, 
and year. However, and in contrast with other studies, we found no evidence of a 
clear cutoff in parasite density values consistent with the concept of "pyrogenic
threshold" despite a gradual increase of the risk of fever with increasing
parasite density. Furthermore, the model evidenced an individual-dependent
relationship at a given age. This point was in accordance with the immunological 
data recorded from the participants. The investigators conclude that the parasite
density to distinguish malaria attacks from other causes of fever is not reliable
in a context of low falciparum transmission.

Behavioural determinants of gene flow in malaria vector populations: Anopheles
gambiae males select large females as mates.

BACKGROUND: Plasmodium-refractory mosquitoes are being rapidly developed for
malaria control but will only succeed if they can successfully compete for mates 
when released into the wild. Pre-copulatory behavioural traits maintain genetic
population structure in wild mosquito populations and mating barriers have foiled
previous attempts to control malaria vectors through sterile male release.
METHODS: Varying numbers of virgin male and female Anopheles gambiae Giles, from 
two strains of different innate sizes, were allowed to mate under standardized
conditions in laboratory cages, following which, the insemination status,
oviposition success and egg batch size of each female was assessed. The influence
of male and female numbers, strain combination and female size were determined
using logistic regression, correlation analysis and a simple mechanistic model of
male competition for females.
RESULTS: Male An. gambiae select females on the basis of size because of much
greater fecundity among large females. Even under conditions where large numbers 
of males must compete for a smaller number of females, the largest females are
more likely to become inseminated, to successfully oviposit and to produce large 
egg batches.
CONCLUSIONS: Sexual selection, on the basis of size, could either promote or
limit the spread of malaria-refractory genes into wild populations and needs to
be considered in the continued development and eventual release of transgenic
vectors. Fundamental studies of behavioural ecology in malaria vectors such as
An. gambiae can have important implications for malaria control and should be
prioritised for more extensive investigation in the future.

Impact of health care financing reforms on the management of malaria in Ghana.

Biritwum RB(1).

Author information: 
(1)Department of Community Health, Ghana Medical School, Accra.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of the introduction of the 'cash and carry'
system on how health care providers manage malaria cases in Ghana.
DESIGN: A cross sectional study of treatment patterns of cases of malaria.
SETTING: Health services in Ghana changed significantly in 1992, from being
virtually free to a 'cash and carry' system in which all patients attending
government health services had to pay in full for drugs and services. Staff of
private companies and parastatal organisations continue to enjoy free health
services at other clinics and hospitals.
SUBJECTS: Prescriptions for 9539 cases diagnosed as having malaria at the
out-patient departments (OPD) of eight health facilities four in the 'cash and
carry' scheme and four outside this scheme were reviewed.
RESULTS: The mean (SD) number of drugs prescribed per case of malaria was higher 
for the 'cash and carry' group than for the 'free for service' group; 4.5+/-1.3
versus 3.8+/-1.3 (p value <.001). Injection chloroquine was used more frequently 
in the 'cash and carry' group than in the 'free service' group 56.4% and 28.6%
respectively (p value <.001). Second-line antimalarial drugs were however, more
often used in the 'free service' group 13.5% versus 7.3% (p value <.001). About
30% of the 'cash and carry' group received antibiotics, compared with 15.5% of
the 'Free Service' group. Logistic regression analysis showed that the modality
of payment for services contributed significantly to whether a case of malaria
was managed with more than three drugs, or received injection chloroquine or
antibiotics or a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug.
CONCLUSION: Evidence in this study suggests that health care providers tend to
pay more attention in treating the symptoms of malaria in cases in which patients
pay for service. This leads to unnecessarily high costs of care for the
individual and the health system.

Significant association of longer forms of CCTTT Microsatellite repeat in the
inducible nitric oxide synthase promoter with severe malaria in Thailand.

A CCTTT microsatellite repeat in the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)
promoter was analyzed among 256 adult patients with severe Plasmodium falciparum 
malaria and 179 adult patients with mild malaria living in northwestern Thailand.
Genotypes with longer forms of the CCTTT repeat (alleles of > or =15 repeats)
were significantly associated with severe malaria (odds ratio [OR], 2.14;
P=.0029, chi(2) test). More interestingly, the summed repeat number of both
microsatellite alleles in an individual was found to be a significant risk factor
for severe malaria (OR, 1.11; logistic regression analysis, P=.0041). The single 
nucleotide substitution, -954G-->C, in the iNOS promoter was rare in Thai
patients with malaria. No variations were detected in the iNOS promoter region
containing functional NF-kappaB elements at -5.2, -5.5, -5.8, and -6.1 kb
upstream of the iNOS transcriptional start site. Thus, a CCTTT repeat in the iNOS
promoter may play a key role in the pathogenesis of severe malaria.

A continental risk map for malaria mosquito (Diptera: Culicidae) vectors in
Europe.

Medicine, UK. katrin.kuhn@lshtm.ac.uk

Although malaria was officially declared eradicated from Europe in 1975, its
former vectors, mainly members of the Anopheles maculipennis (Meigen) complex,
are still distributed throughout the continent. The present situation of
Anophelism without malaria indicates that current socio-economic and
environmental conditions maintain the basic case reproduction number, Ro, below
1. Recently, it has been speculated that predicted climate changes may increase
anopheline abundance and biting rates (as well as reduce the Plasmodium parasite 
extrinsic incubation period), allowing the reemergence of malaria transmission in
Europe. As a preliminary step toward predicting future scenarios, we have
constructed models to test whether the current distribution of the five former
European malaria vectors [An. atroparvus (Van Thiel),An. labranchiae (Falleroni),
An. messeae (Swellengrebel & De Buck), An. sacharovi (Favr) and An. superpictus
(Grassi)] can be explained by environmental parameters, including climate.
Multivariate logistic regression models using climate surfaces derived from
interpolation of meteorological station data (resolution 0.5 x 0.5 degrees) and
remotely sensed land cover (resolution 1 x 1 km) were fitted to 1,833 reported
observations of the presence and absence of each species across Europe. These
relatively crude statistical models predicted presence and absence with a
sensitivity of 74-85.7% and specificity of 73.4-98.1% (with climate a
significantly better predictor than land cover type). A geographically
independent validation of the models gave a sensitivity of 72.9-88.5% and a
specificity of 72.7-99.6%. This allowed us to generate risk maps for each species
across Europe. Assuming that high risk equates with the potential for high
abundance, these models should permit the development of risk maps for European
mosquitoes under future climate scenarios. These techniques would be equally
useful for estimating the risk of reemergence in other nonendemic areas such as
the United States and Australia, as well as changes to risk within endemic areas.

Following a study showing an association between Ascaris and protection from
cerebral malaria, we hypothesized helminths may have induced protection through
immunoglobulin E (IgE) and the CD23/NO pathway. We compared the prevalence of
helminth infections in 67 cerebral malaria patients and 217 hyperparasitemic
controls with no complications. For 24 cerebral malaria cases and 56 controls, we
compared reactive nitrogen intermediates (RNI) concentrations and their
correlations to total IgE and sCD23 concentrations in helminth-infected and
noninfected patients. We observed a dose-dependent association between helminth
infections and protection from cerebral malaria (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 0.36,
95% CI = 0.19-0.7, P = 0.002, linear trend P = 0.0007). Helminth-infected
controls had higher RNI concentrations than those without helminths: 72 OD +/- 19
SD and 57 OD +/- 20 SD, respectively (P = 0.006). Logistic regression, including 
interaction terms between RNI and sCD23, showed that an increase of RNI could be 
both protective and pathogenic depending on the concentration of sCD23. Helminths
increasing both the CD23 receptor and its ligand may have a role in the
establishment of malaria tolerance through the CD23/NO pathway.

We studied the impact of reduced residual spraying in Belize by developing a
logistic regression model on relationships between numbers of houses sprayed
(mostly with DDT) and numbers of malaria cases. We defined the "minimum effective
house spray rate" (MEHSR) as the level of spraying that will prevent increases in
malaria rates for a defined population. Under the total coverage approach (all
houses sprayed), the MEHSR for Belize was 134.6. The model also showed that the
odds for decreasing malaria is 1.086 for each increase of 10 houses sprayed per
1,000 population. In further testing, highly significant and differential changes
in malaria rates were documented for paired groups of years with house spray
rates that were either above or below the MEHSR. Numbers of malaria cases since
1995 are used to show how stratification methods are used in Belize to spray
fewer houses (at levels below the MEHSR of 134.6).

Contribution of nonspecific laboratory test to the diagnosis of malaria in
febrile travelers returning from endemic areas: value of hypocholesterolemia.

    J Travel Med. 2003 Jan-Feb;10(1):66-7; author reply 67.

BACKGROUND: The gold standard in diagnosis of malaria is microscopic detection of
malaria parasites in thin blood smears. However, the sensitivity and specificity 
of blood smears depend mostly on the experience of the examiner. In the traveler 
returning from the tropics, diagnosis of malaria may be difficult when the
parasitemia is low. In this circumstance any indicator that suggests the
diagnosis of malaria is of great interest. The aim of this study is to determine 
the value of hypocholesterolemia to the diagnosis of imported malaria.
METHOD: A retrospective case-control study was performed among hospitalized
patients with fever returning from a malaria-endemic area, to compare the results
of routine biological parameters of 129 malaria cases with those of 92 control
patients.
RESULTS: Multivariate analysis, using a logistic regression model demonstrates
that hypocholesterolemia was the strongest parameter associated with malaria
(adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 75.22, 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.60-1227.78) and 
the most specific (98%, 95% CI 0.95-1.0). The most sensitive abnormality was
thrombocytopenia (82%, 95% CI-0.77 0.87). With a malaria prevalence of 52% in our
population study, hypocholesterolemia has the strongest positive predictive value
among routine biological parameters for malaria diagnosis (96%). The combination 
of hypocholesterolemia and thrombocytopenia was always associated with diagnosis 
of malaria in this study.
CONCLUSION: These results show that hypocholesterolemia is significantly
associated with malaria. Therefore, in the setting of negative thin and thick
blood smears, the presence of hypocholesterolemia, particularly when it is
combined with thrombocytopenia, in a febrile traveler returning from a

Although human infection with Ascaris appears to be associated with protection
from cerebral malaria, there are many potential socio-economic and nutritional
confounders related to helminth infection that need to be considered. In a
hospital-based study, 37 cases of cerebral malaria and 61 cases of non-severe
malaria with high parasite biomass (i.e. hyperparasitaemia and/or circulating
schizonts) answered a structured questionnaire and were screened for intestinal
helminths. Logistic regression was then used to adjust for the potential
confounders. The adjusted odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals
(CI) still showed a significant protective association for helminths (OR = 0.24; 
CI = 0.07-0.78, P = 0.02) and malnutrition (OR = 0.11; CI = 0.02-0.58; P = 0.01),
with no evidence of interaction between the two. There was also a significant
dose-effect trend for the helminth infections (P = 0.048). These results, despite
coming from a hospital-based study, indicate that the apparent association
between helminths and protection from cerebral malaria is not the result of
socio-economic or nutritional confounders.

In animal studies, vitamin A deficiency induces a shift from type 2 (humoral) to 
type 1 (cellular) cytokines; there are no similar data for humans. Control of
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections
requires type 1 cytokine (cellular) immunity. These infections and vitamin A
deficiency are highly prevalent in Africa. We therefore examined the interactions
among serum vitamin A levels, immune parameters, HIV infection status,
Mycobacterium bovis BCG vaccine scarring (as an indicator of a type 1 cytokine
profile), and clinical findings for 70 hospitalized children in Malawi, Africa.
Directly conjugated monoclonal antibodies and flow cytometry were used to assess 
cell-specific cytokine production by peripheral blood monocytes and lymphocyte
subpopulations. The statistical techniques employed included nonparametric
statistics and logistic regression analyses. Thirty percent of the participants
had severe vitamin A deficiency (<10 microg/dl), 34% had moderate deficiency (10 
to <20 microg/dl), and 36% had normal levels (> or = 20 microg/dl). Vitamin A
levels were lower for HIV-positive than for HIV-negative children (median, 10 and
17 microg/dl, respectively). Vitamin A-deficient children (<20 microg/dl) were
more likely than non-vitamin A-deficient children to have higher proportions of
natural killer (NK) cells (median, 8.3 and 5.2%, respectively) and lower ratios
of interleukin-10-producing monocytes to tumor necrosis factor alpha-producing
monocytes after induction (median, 1.0 and 2.3, respectively). Vitamin
A-deficient children were also more likely than non-vitamin A-deficient children 
to exhibit respiratory symptoms (47% versus 12%) and visible BCG vaccine scars
(83% versus 48%), which are indicative of a type 1 response to vaccination.
Vitamin A status did not vary with gender, age, incidence of malaria parasitemia,
blood culture positivity, or rates of mortality (6% of vitamin A-deficient
children died versus 20% of non-vitamin A-deficient children). Lower vitamin A
levels were associated with a relative type 1 cytokine dominance and
proportionately more NK cells, both of which may be somewhat beneficial to
persons who are exposed to HIV, M. tuberculosis, or other type 1 pathogens.

Clinical signs and symptoms in the assessment of immunodeficiency in men with
subtype C HIV infection in Harare, Zimbabwe.

PURPOSE: Providing low-cost interventions such as co-trimoxazole as prophylaxis
against opportunistic infections among HIV-infected individuals depends on the
identification of those at risk. This article describes the prevalence of
self-reported signs and symptoms and CD4 cell counts in a cohort of 447 HIV
seropositive men. A scoring system using self-reported signs and symptoms was
developed and tested in the prediction of low CD4 cell counts. This approach may 
allow health care providers in low-resource settings to predict severe
immunodeficiency and to provide care.
METHOD: Data on clinical manifestations of HIV infection and blood samples for
HIV serology were collected prospectively from an ambulatory cohort of men seen
at their workplace at enrollment and every 6 months thereafter. CD4+ cell counts 
were obtained on samples testing positive on ELISA. Using data reduction
techniques and logistic modeling, we developed a prognostic score system.
RESULTS: 20% of the men had CD4+ cell counts below 200. All reported signs and
symptoms were more frequent in men with less than 200 CD4+ cell counts compared
to men with CD4+ cell counts greater than 200. History of malaria, fever,
lymphadenopathy, persistent diarrhea, persistent cough, and skin infections
robustly predicted low CD4+ count. A scoring system equation was developed based 
on the coefficients of the multivariate logistic regression: 1x(tuberculosis) +
3.2x(herpes zoster) + 4.5x(malaria) + 5.7x(fever) + 5.8x(cough) +
8.2x(lymphadenopathy) + 8.5x(skin infection). Setting the score cutoff value
greater than or equal 5, the model had moderately high sensitivity of 61% and
specificity of 72%. The scoring system had an overall classification error rate
of 30%.
CONCLUSION: By using this simple scoring system, physicians can correctly
identify 72% of patients who do not require immediate intervention, thereby
channeling scarce resources to those who have both low CD4+ cell counts and
symptoms and are most likely to benefit from prophylactic and antiretroviral
interventions.

Bacteraemia is a recognised complication of severe malaria and may increase
mortality. We determined 1) the rate and pattern of bacteraemia in children with 
severe malaria; 2) the impact of bacteraemia on case-fatality rate; and 3) the
rate and pattern of bacteraemia in following blood transfusion for severe
malarial anaemia. For the first two objectives, a prospective study was
undertaken involving children admitted consecutively to the Malaria Research
Project ward between February 1996 and June 1999. Blood culture was performed on 
admission. Independent associations with bacteraemia and mortality were
determined by logistic regression. Of 701 children with a final diagnosis of
severe malaria, 36 (5.1%) had bacteraemia. A wide range of bacteria was isolated 
and the commonest was non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS: n=18 or 50% of all
isolates). The rate of bacteraemia was significantly higher in children with
severe malarial anaemia without coma (11.2%) than in children with cerebral
malaria without anaemia (3.2%) and this was due to the significant association of
NTS bacteraemia with severe malarial anaemia (p<0.001). The overall case-fatality
rate was 15% and was higher in children with bacteraemia (22%) but this
difference was not significant. For the third objective, data were collected
retrospectively of all children who received a blood transfusion in the
paediatric department from March 1996 until May 1997 inclusive. A total of 1712
children received a blood transfusion. Of these, 243 (14.2%) had a blood culture 
taken for the investigation of fever following transfusion; a pathogen was grown 
from 60 (24.7%). NTS bacteraemia accounted for 76.3% of all bacteraemia cases.
NTS bacteraemia is a common complication of severe malarial anaemia.

Birthweight distribution at Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital, Ghana.

Klufio CA(1), Lassey AT, Annan BD, Wilson JB.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of Ghana Medical School, 
P.O. Box 4236, Accra, Ghana.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the birthweight distribution of singleton births at the 
Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital and to determine if selected socio-demographic and
reproductive characteristics that are known to be associated with birthweight
would show the association in our setting.
DESIGN: A non-randomised cross-sectional survey of all deliveries within the
study period.
SETTING: Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital, a tertiary institution, delivering about
11,000 women a year.
STUDY POPULATION: From 1st November to 12th December 1994, 866 singleton normally
formed livebirths and fresh stillbirths were sequentially enrolled.
DATA SOURCES: Data sources were the antenatal and delivery records of the
subjects and an interviewer-administered questionnaire.
RESULTS: The mean birthweight for the total sample was 3070 g +/- 616 g. One
hundred and fifteen (13.3%) babies were low birthweight. The mean birthweight for
those with reliable dates and born at term was 3262 g +/- 488.8 g. Multiple
logistic regression analysis showed lack of antenatal malaria chemoprophylaxis
and a history of previous low birthweight to be significantly associated with low
birthweight.
CONCLUSION: Although the mean birthweight of Korle-Bu babies was lower than those
of USA and UK babies, it was comparable with those from other developing
countries. Antenatal malaria chemoprophylaxis is a practical intervention that
can produce an increase in mean birthweight and reduce the risk of low
birthweight in our population.

Molecular assays for monitoring sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine-resistant Plasmodium
falciparum have not been implemented because of the genetic and statistical
complexity of the parasite mutations that confer resistance and their relation to
treatment outcomes. This study analyzed pretreatment dihydrofolate reductase
(DHFR) and dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) genotypes and treatment outcomes in a 
double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and
chlorproguanil-dapsone treatment for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria.
Multiple logistic regression was used to identify mutations that were predictive 
of treatment failure and to identify interactions and confounding factors.
Infections caused by parasites with 3 DHFR mutations and 2 DHPS mutations (the
"quintuple mutant") were associated with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine treatment
failure but not with chlorproguanil-dapsone treatment failure. The presence of a 
single DHFR mutation (Arg-59) with a single DHPS mutation (Glu-540) accurately
predicted the presence of the quintuple mutant. If this model is validated in
other populations, it will finally be possible to use molecular markers for
surveillance of antifolate-resistant P. falciparum malaria in Africa.

Factors influencing the use of bed nets in Mbarara municipality of Uganda.

Nuwaha F(1).

Author information: 
(1)Health Services Sector, Bushenyi Local Government, Uganda.

In order to identify independent predictors for bed net use, respondents from 643
households selected randomly from 21 clusters were interviewed in Mbarara
municipality, Uganda. Respondents answered questions about demographic
characteristics, social economic conditions, causes and transmission of malaria, 
beliefs about severity and complications of malaria, malaria morbidity and health
care-seeking behavior, perceived control of malaria prevention, beliefs about
utility of bed nets, perceived susceptibility to malaria, and whether they use
bed nets or not. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were
used to identify predictors for bed net use. Fifty-five percent (356 of 643) of
the households had bed net users. The independent factors that favored bed net
use were as follows: 1) age < 30 years, 2) ownership of a television, 3) having
mosquito nets in ventilators of the house, 4) being a skilled worker or a
professional, or owning a major business, 5) living in a permanent house, 6)
believing that bed nets prevent malaria, 7) believing that bed nets are worth
their cost, 8) not believing that convulsions cannot be cured by modern medicine,
and 9) believing that bed nets are not expensive. The strongest predictors of bed
net use are living in a permanent house and agreeing that bed nets are worth
their cost, with adjusted odds ratios of 4.29 (95% confidence interval,
2.76-6.71) and 3.93 (95% confidence interval, 2.5-26.13), respectively. These
data suggest that in order to increase the use of bed nets, the price of bed nets
needs to be reduced and educational messages that stress the favorable use of bed
nets need to be increased.

BACKGROUND: Allergic diseases seem less prevalent in communities in less
developed parts of the world, where parasite infections are highly prevalent.
Altogether not much is known about the association between chronic infections
with tissue and blood-dwelling parasites and atopy.
METHODS: In an area in Gabon endemic for blood and tissue parasites, 520
schoolchildren were parasitologically examined and skin prick-tested for a set of
common environmental aeroallergens. Levels of allergen-specific IgE and
polyclonal IgE were measured.
RESULTS: In schoolchildren schistosome and filarial infections increased with
age, whereas malaria was more prevalent in younger children. In contrast to
allergen sensitization that increased with age, skin test reactivity tended to
decline. The number of children with mite-specific IgE antibodies (47%) by far
exceeded the number responding to skin prick testing (11%). Mite sensitization
was found to be the highest in children infected with schistosomes and/or
filariae whereas skin test reactivity was lowest. The multiple logistic
regression showed that the risk of a positive skin test was 8-fold higher with
increasing levels of mite-specific IgE but was reduced by 72% when infected with 
blood stage helminths.
CONCLUSIONS: Chronic blood and tissue parasite infections that are often capable 
of modulating immune responses in the host are negatively associated with skin
test reactivity in a sensitized population.

Médecine Pitié-Salpétrière, Paris, France.

The objective of this study was to determine whether pre-existing helminth
infections could affect sexual forms of Plasmodium falciparum. A cross-sectional 
case record study compared 120 mild P. falciparum malaria cases with patent
gametocyte carriage and 187 without gametocytes for helminth exposure. Relevant
crude odds ratios and potential confounders were included in a logistic
regression model. Helminth infections were associated with the presence of
gametocytes with a crude odds ratio of 1.9 (95% confidence interval = 1.1-3.3) (P
= 0.01). A positive linear trend was observed between the odds of having patent
gametocytemia and the number of different helminth species (P = 0.003). However, 
when adjusting for hemoglobin concentration the significance of the association
between helminths and gametocytes disappeared (P = 0.15). Pre-existing helminth
infections may increase the severity of malarial anemia and therefore increase
the likelihood of carrying gametocytes. At a population level, helminth
infections may thus have a significant influence on malaria transmission.

Author information: 
(1)Institute of Tropical Medicine, Charité, Humboldt University, Berlin, Germany.

Little is known about the distribution and disease association of multiple
Plasmodium falciparum infections in pregnant women. Genotyping of the merozoite
surface protein-1 region was performed in 332 P. falciparum infected pregnant
women in Ghana, and clinical and epidemiologic data were obtained. Overall, 68%
of the women were infected with more than one strain (mean number of strains per 
carrier = 2.9). The multiplicity of infection decreased significantly with an
increasing number of pregnancies, and infection with multiple P. falciparum
strains was significantly associated with anemia. In logistic regression, women
infected with four or more strains were 2.3 times more likely to be anemic than
women harboring fewer strains. This association, however, was only observed in
women with up to three pregnancies. The results suggest that with increasing
gravidity and subsequent infections with multiple strains effective immune
mechanisms against more and more strains develop. In pregnant women, the
multiplicity of infection may be an important factor for the acquisition and
maintenance of immunity against malaria.

Mapping distributions of chromosomal forms of Anopheles gambiae in West Africa
using climate data.

Bayoh MN(1), Thomas CJ, Lindsay SW.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biological Sciences, University of Durham, UK.

The mosquito Anopheles gambiae Giles sensu stricto (Diptera: Culicidae), the
principal vector of malaria in West Africa, comprises several chromosomal forms
(e.g. Bissau, Forest, Mopti, Savanna) associated with climatic zones. Here we
show how climate data can be used to map the geographical distribution of these
chromosomal forms. The climate at 144 sites surveyed for mosquitoes in West
Africa between 1971 and 92 was determined using computerized climate surfaces.
Forest and Bissau forms occurred at relatively wet sites: median annual
precipitation 1325 mm and 1438 mm, respectively, interquartile ranges (IQR)
1144-1858 mm and 1052-1825 mm), whilst the Mopti form was found at dry sites
(annual 938 mm, IQR 713-1047 mm) and the Savanna form at sites intermediate
between the wet and dry forms (annual 1067 mm, IQR 916-1279). Logistic regression
analyses of the climate variables were carried out on a stratified random sample 
of half the sites. The resulting models correctly classified over 80% of the
sites for presence or absence of each chromosomal form. When these models were
tested against excluded sites they were also correct at over 80% of sites. The
combined data produced models that were correct at over 86% of sites. Mean annual
precipitation, evapotranspiration, minimum temperature and maximum temperature
were the most important climate variables correlated with the distribution of
these forms of An. gambiae. We used the logistic models to map the distribution
of each chromosomal form within the reported range for An. gambiae s.s. in West
Africa employing a geographical information system. Our maps indicate that each
chromosomal form favours particular climate envelopes in well-defined ecoclimatic
zones, although these forms are sympatric at the edges of their ranges. This
study demonstrates that climate can be used to map the distribution of
chromosomal forms of insects across large areas.

The role of rodents as Leptospira renal carriers in Terceira island was evaluated
(1993-1995) through kidney culture and serology [microscopic aglutination test
(MAT)] of 94 mice and rats. Fifty-nine animals were positive (n = 41 by serology 
+ culturing; n = 11 serology; n = 7 culturing), presenting a wide distribution in
man-made and natural areas. House mice had the highest bacteriological (82.9%)
and serological (90.9%) rates, being strictly related to serovar arborea. Black
rats were involved in the dispersion of all isolated L. interrogans sensu lato
serovars (arborea, copenhageni and icterohaemorrhagiae). Logistic regression
analysis and non-metric multi-dimensional scaling, relating Leptospira infection 
with biological and environmental variables, expressed that adult males Mus
domesticus, sexually active and living in humid biotopes, mainly above 500 m, are
the most likely reservoirs. This study emphasizes the role of house-mice in the
epidemiology of leptospirosis in Terceira and the need of reducing the risk of
Leptospira transmission through integrated control programmes, primarily focusing
on adult house-mice in peri-domestic environments, before the breeding season.

Seasonal variation in the etiology of bloodstream infections in a febrile
inpatient population in a developing country.

Jarvis WR.

Author information: 
(1)Hospital Infections Program, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
Atlanta, Georgia, USA.

OBJECTIVES: Published data suggest that Streptococcus pneumoniae, non-typhi
Salmonella species, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis are the predominant causes of 
bloodstream infection (BSI) in hospitalized populations in sub-Saharan Africa.
This study was conducted during the wet season to ascertain the etiology and
prevalence of BSI among febrile inpatients in a hospital where the dry season BSI
profile in a similar study population had already been documented.
METHODS: In the period from March to May 1998, consecutive febrile (> or = 37.5
degrees C) adult (> or = 14 y) patients presenting to a Malawi hospital were
enrolled after providing informed consent. Following clinical evaluation, blood
was drawn for culture (bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi), human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV) testing, and malaria smears.
RESULTS: Of 238 enrolled patients, 173 (73%) were HIV-positive and 67 (28%) had
BSI. The predominant wet season BSI pathogens were non-typhi Salmonella species
(41%), M. tuberculosis (19%), and Cryptococcus neoformans (9%) (cf. the
predominant dry season pathogen was S. pneumoniae). Mycobacteremia was more
likely in HIV-positive than in HIV-negative patients (13/173 vs. 0/65; P < 0.05).
A logistic regression model yielded clinical predictors of BSI that included
chronic fever, oral candidiasis, or acute diarrhea.
CONCLUSION: Pathogens causing BSI in febrile inpatients in a Malawi teaching
hospital vary by season. Season- and country-specific studies, such as this one, 
provide data that may facilitate empirical therapy of febrile illnesses whose
etiologies vary by season.

Risk factors of malaria in the fringes of an evergreen monsoon forest of
Arunachal Pradesh.

Mohapatra PK(1), Narain K, Prakash A, Bhattacharyya DR, Mahanta J.

Author information: 
(1)Regional Medical Research Centre, Northeastern Region, Indian Council of
Medical Research, P.O. Box 105, Dibrugarh 786001, Assam, India.

BACKGROUND: The forested hilly and foothill regions of north-east India are
highly endemic for malaria and have a distinct epidemiological pattern. Nearly
half the reported cases of malaria are from these areas. A knowledge of the risk 
factors in this eco-geographic entity may be helpful in formulating a specific
control strategy. Hence, we conducted a community-based epidemiological study in 
a hilly, forested terrain of Arunachal Pradesh and examined different
socio-demographic factors to identify those predisposing to the occurrence of
malaria, especially Plasmodium falciparum infection, in such areas.
METHODS: Four epidemiological surveys were carried out during 1997 in 7 villages 
located at the fringes of a forest (total population: 1177) under Nompong Primary
Health Centre of Changlang district, Arunachal Pradesh. Blood slides were
collected randomly from the inhabitants, irrespective of their fever status,
ensuring at least 50% coverage. One hundred and thirty-four microscopically
confirmed Plasmodium falciparum cases were identified and 536 controls were
randomly selected from the list of uninfected inhabitants. Relevant
socio-demographic information was obtained from both cases and controls. The data
were analysed by simple and multiple logistic regression using the unconditional 
maximum likelihood method.
RESULTS: Factors which were found to be strongly associated with Plasmodium
falciparum malaria on univariate analysis were age, ethnicity, village of
residence and accessibility to the nearest health care facility. However, in
multiple regression analysis, after controlling for the effects of confounding
variables, the only risk factor identified was accessibility to the nearest
health care facility (adjusted odds ratio: 4.5; 95% CI: 1.8-11.3; p < 0.0001 for 
those at a distance of 2-8 km and adjusted odds ratio: 11.1; 95% CI: 4.1-30.0; p 
< 0.0001 for those > 8 km away).
CONCLUSION: Distance, particularly non-motorable distance, from the place of
residence to the nearest health care facility was a major risk factor for malaria
in this hilly forested terrain. This indicates the need for special efforts to
detect cases early and institute treatment promptly in such areas of the
north-eastern region, so as to reduce the morbidity and mortality of malaria.

Landscape features associated with infection by a malaria parasite (Plasmodium
mexicanum) and the importance of multiple scale studies.

reisen@nature.berkeley.edu

In a 3-year study, we examined landscape features (aspect, slope, sun exposure,
canopy cover, type of ground cover, and nearest water source) that were
potentially related to prevalence of infection with Plasmodium mexicanum in fence
lizards (Sceloporus occidentalis) within a 4.5 ha study area in northern
California, USA. Logistic regression analysis showed that ground cover type was
the primary mediator of the probability of P. mexicanum infection. Infected
lizards were captured more often in rock and/or leaf litter locations than in
grassy ones. In another experiment, the study area was divided into 9 sites
(0.07-0.33 ha), and infection prevalence was calculated for each. Three sites
with high (> 30%) infection prevalence had significantly more rocky outcrops and 
leaf litter than those with low (< 20%) or moderate (20-30%) infection prevalence
(N = 3 sites each). We conclude that lizard site selection may influence the
probability of exposure to infected vectors and thus the likelihood of P.
mexicanum infection. We also demonstrate that studies at different spatial scales
may be required to understand fully the relationship between landscape features
and parasite distribution.

Associations of peak shifts in age--prevalence for human malarias with bednet
coverage.

Effects of bednet coverage (C) on prevalence of malaria were analysed using data 
from 1990-92 from 9 Papua New Guinean villages. Effects of coverage varied by
age, resulting in a shift in age of peak prevalence from 4.7 (C = 0%) to 11.6 (C 
= 100%) years for Plasmodium falciparum, from 3.4 to 4.9 years for P. vivax and
from 11.0 to 16.8 years for P. malariae. In small areas with no bednets the age
distribution of P. falciparum parasitaemia was like that of a holoendemic area.
Where coverage was complete the pattern corresponded to mesoendemicity. Thus,
protracted use of bednets can result in profound changes in the endemicity of
malaria even when coverage is incomplete and without insecticide treatment.
Average entomological inoculation rates (EIRs) estimated from indoor landing
rates on individuals without bednets were 35, 12 and 10 infectious bites per
person per annum for P. falciparum, P. vivax and P. malariae, respectively.
Logistic regression analyses indicated that the EIR estimate for P. falciparum
was related to prevalence of this species independently of effects of bednet
coverage. However, the recent EIR still accounted for much less variation than
did the bednets. A similar pattern was seen for P. malariae, while there were no 
significant relationships between the recent EIR and the parasite positivity for 
P. vivax. It is concluded that short-term variations in inoculation rate are not 
important determinants of parasite prevalence in this population.

Hospital, Maputo, Mozambique. osman@teledata.mz

A prospective cohort of 908 consecutively enrolled pregnant women with biparietal
diameter (DBP) compatible with gestational age equal to or below 21 weeks were
followed up regularly at 2-4 weeks intervals. Normal antenatal care routine was
applied. The newborns were followed until 7 days postpartum. The setting was two 
suburban antenatal clinics in Maputo and the delivery ward at the Maputo Central 
Hospital. The main outcome variables were low birth weight (LBW), preterm
delivery, intrauterine fetal death, perinatal death and small for gestational age
(SGA). For each of these variables the odds ratio for maternal risk factors was
estimated with 95 per cent confidence interval and multiple logistic regression
analysis was used. LBW occurred in 16.2 per cent and low maternal weight, low
weight gain during pregnancy and not having a living child were risk factors.
Prevalence of preterm birth was 15.4 per cent and low weight gain during
pregnancy and malaria in the perinatal period were risk factors. Four per cent of
mothers delivered stillborns and syphilis serology (positive VDRL test) was a
risk factor. Perinatal death occurred in 4.7 per cent. These deaths were
associated with being SGA, LBW or preterm at birth. Of the cohort women, 9.7 per 
cent delivered SGA newborns. It was concluded that maternal constitutional
factors, particularly maternal weight gain, maternal height and maternal weight
as well as syphilis and malaria during pregnancy, need to be given attention
concerning the adverse outcomes addressed. The establishment of an obstetric
cohort, followed prospectively, was possible in a low-income setting with limited
numbers lost to follow-up at delivery.

We conducted a cross-sectional study to identify the socio-economic and
environmental protective/risk factors for severe malaria in Thailand. Forty-six
cases of severe malaria, 72 cases of non-severe malaria with high parasite
biomass and 40 mild malaria cases were included. When comparing severe malaria
and non-severe malaria with high parasite biomass, specific logistic regression
models showed a significant protective effect for helminths, adjusted odds ratio 
0.24 (0.07-0.78) for low body mass index (BMI), adjusted odds ratio 0.11
(0.02-0.58). When comparing severe and mild malaria, a longer residence duration,
adjusted odds ratio 0.36 (0.09-0.83) and the use of antimalarial self-medication,
adjusted odds ratio 0.08 (0.009-0.84) were associated with protection from severe
malaria. Using stepwise logistic regression with all the variables inserted in
the model yielded similar results. These findings suggest specific immunity and
self-medication control parasite multiplication whereas helminths and
malnutrition more specifically affect the pathogenesis of severe malaria.

Severe malaria is an important cause of death in hospitalized children in
Mozambique, but the risk factors for this remain unclear. The objectives of the
study were to define simple clinical criteria to identify on admission the
children most at risk of dying. We studied prospectively 559 children admitted
with severe malaria to the Department of Paediatrics of the Central Hospital of
Maputo, Mozambique between March 1995 and August 1996. The case fatality rate was
3.6%. In a multiple logistic regression model, mothers' education (RR = 9.6, 95% 
CI 1.2-76.0), acidotic breathing (RR = 4.3, 95% CI 1.3-13.8) and convulsions in
the emergency room (RR = 8.1, 95% CI 2.6-25.1) were associated with outcome.
Together they predicted 97% of outcomes but only 33.3% of deaths.

OBJECTIVES: There are a number of case reports in the medical literature
suggesting an association between the ingestion of chloroquine and subsequent
seizure activity. Our study was designed to investigate the relationship between 
blood levels of chloroquine (CQ), its metabolite desethylchloroquine (DCQ), and
seizures in children admitted to hospital with cerebral malaria.
METHODS: Serial blood levels of CQ and DCQ were measured over the first 24 h of
hospital admission in children with cerebral malaria. The number and duration of 
all seizures was recorded, and statistical analysis subsequently performed to
determine the relationship between seizure activity and blood concentrations of
CQ and DCQ.
RESULTS: Chloroquine was detected in 92% (100/109) of admission blood samples.
54% (59/109) of the patients had one or more seizures after admission, while 8%
(9/109) had an episode of status epilepticus. Median (interquartile range)
baseline concentrations of CQ and DCQ were, respectively, 169.4 microg/ml
(75.1-374.9) and 352.3 microg/ml (81.9-580.1) for those children who had seizures
after admission, compared to CQ 227.5 microg/ml (79.4-430.2) and DCQ 364.0
microg/ml (131.3-709.4) for those who did not have seizures (P > 0.5 for all
comparisons). Baseline concentrations of CQ and DCQ were not significantly
associated with the occurrence of seizures lasting for 5 min or more. The nine
children who had an episode of status epilepticus had significantly lower median 
admission levels of CQ than those without status epilepticus: 75.1 microg/l
(7.4-116.5) vs. 227.5 microg/l (85.6-441.2), P = 0.02. Multivariate logistic
regression analysis, taking into account factors likely to affect the risk of
seizures in hospital, failed to change the significance of these results.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that chloroquine does not play an important
role in the aetiology of seizures in childhood cerebral malaria.

Impact of subpatent multi-species and multi-clonal plasmodial infections on
anaemia in children from Nigeria.

Childhood anaemia in sub-Saharan Africa is often caused by Plasmodium falciparum 
malaria. The influence of subpatent, multi-species and polyclonal infections with
malaria parasites on haematological parameters was assessed in 1996/97 in
clinically healthy children in Nigeria. Of the 228 children studied, 64% were
anaemic by the WHO age-dependent criteria. A univariate analysis of risk factors 
indicated that the prevalence of anaemia was dependent on the number of
Plasmodium species detected by species-specific PCR (P < 0.0001). Furthermore,
the prevalence of anaemia increased gradually with the complexity (P < 0.003) as 
well as with the extent of P. falciparum parasitaemia (P < 0.0001). A logistic
regression analysis revealed that individuals with an enlarged spleen tended to
be anaemic. The number of Plasmodium species by which an individual was infected 
was independently associated with anaemia (P < 0.03). ANOVA revealed that the
age-corrected values for haemoglobin (Hb) and red blood cells (RBCs) were mainly 
influenced by the occurrence of mixed infections. Haematological parameters were 
also influenced by the number of different P. falciparum clones by which an
individual was infected. Hb levels and RBC counts were further diminished by
additional infections with P. malariae and/or P. ovale. However, the effect of
multi-species infections on haematological parameters exceeded that of
multi-clonal infections.

In rural Malawi, 703 newborns were visited monthly for 1 year to describe the
epidemiology and health-seeking behaviour during acute episodes of diarrhoea,
respiratory infections (ARI) and malaria. On average, the infants suffered from
1.3 annual episodes (11.0 illness days) of diarrhoea, 1.1 episodes (9.4 days) of 
ARI and 0.7 episodes (4.8 days) of malaria. Multivariate analysis with
polychotomous logistic regression indicated that the amount of morbidity was
associated with the child's area of residence, weight in early life, number of
siblings, father's marital status and the source of drinking water. Diarrhoea and
malaria were most common at 6-12 months of age and during the rainy months
whereas respiratory infections peaked at 1-3 months of age and in the cold
season. Ten per cent of diarrhoea, 9% of ARI and 7% of malaria episodes lasted
for more than 14 days. Fifty-eight infants died, giving case fatality rates of 1%
for diarrhoea, 2% for ARI and 4% for malaria. One-third (37%) of the illness
episodes were managed at home without external advice. A traditional healer was
consulted in 16% of episodes and a medical professional in 55% of episodes. If
consulted, traditional healers were seen earlier than medical professionals
(median duration after the onset of symptoms 0.7 vs. 1.8 days, P < 0.001).
Traditional healers were significantly more commonly used by those families whose
infants died than by those whose infants did not die (odds ratio 1.8, 95% CI 1.1,
3.0). Our results emphasise the influence of seasonality, care and living
conditions on the morbidity of infants in rural Malawi. Case fatality for
diarrhoea, ARI and malaria was high and associated with health-seeking behaviour 
among the guardians. Future interventions must aim at early and appropriate
management of common childhood illnesses during infancy.

Malaria and anemia are common in pregnant African women. We screened 4,764
Malawian women at first antenatal visits for malaria and anemia. A total of 42.7%
had a malaria infection, which was more common and of higher density in
primigravidae (prevalence = 47.3%, geometric mean = 332 parasites/microl) and
teenagers (49.8%, 390/microl) than in multigravidae (40.4%, 214/microl) or older 
women (40.6%, 227/microl). However, 35% of gravida 3+ women were parasitemic. A
total of 57.2% of the women was anemic (hemoglobin < 11 g/dl), with moderate
anemia (7.0-8.9 g/dl) in 14.9% and severe anemia (< 7 g/dl) in 3.2%. Prevalences 
of malaria and anemia were highest in the rainy season. Women with
moderate/severe anemia had higher parasite prevalences and densities than women
with mild/no anemia. Logistic regression showed that age, season, and trimester
of presentation were significantly associated with the prevalence of malaria, but
gravidity was not. In this urban setting, age and season are more important than 
gravidity as predictors of malaria at first antenatal visit, and parasitemia is
frequent in women of all gravidities.

From September 1995 to May 1997, 315 consecutive stillbirths and 315 randomly
selected controls were studied at the Port Moresby General Hospital to determine 
the causes of the deaths, to describe the sociodemographic and reproductive
characteristics of the mothers, and to see if there were any avoidable factors in
the stillbirths and where the responsibility for them lay. 249 (79%) of the
stillbirths were antepartum and 14% were intrapartum; the timing of death could
not be determined in the remaining 21 (7%). 36% of the stillbirths were
unexplained. The common identified causes were: syphilis (VDRL and TPHA positive)
10%, intrauterine growth restriction/placental insufficiency 9%, antepartum
haemorrhage 9%, malaria 6%, major congenital abnormalities 6%, cord accidents 6%,
pregnancy-induced hypertension 5% and acute intrapartum asphyxia 4%. Multiple
logistic regression analysis showed a significant association between stillbirth 
and the following variables: husband's occupation unskilled, age over 35 years,
poor antenatal attendance, a past history of stillbirth, syphilis and malaria. An
avoidable factor was established in 41% of the cases; in 60% the responsibility
for the avoidable factor lay with the patient and her relatives.

A spatial statistical approach to malaria mapping.

Kleinschmidt I(1), Bagayoko M, Clarke GP, Craig M, Le Sueur D.

Author information: 
(1)Medical Research Council (South Africa), Congella, Durban. kleinsci@mrc.ac.za

BACKGROUND: Good maps of malaria risk have long been recognized as an important
tool for malaria control. The production of such maps relies on modelling to
predict the risk for most of the map, with actual observations of malaria
prevalence usually only known at a limited number of specific locations.
Estimation is complicated by the fact that there is often local variation of risk
that cannot be accounted for by the known covariates and because data points of
measured malaria prevalence are not evenly or randomly spread across the area to 
be mapped.
METHOD: We describe, by way of an example, a simple two-stage procedure for
producing maps of predicted risk: we use logistic regression modelling to
determine approximate risk on a larger scale and we employ geo-statistical
('kriging') approaches to improve prediction at a local level. Malaria prevalence
in children under 10 was modelled using climatic, population and topographic
variables as potential predictors. After the regression analysis, spatial
dependence of the model residuals was investigated. Kriging on the residuals was 
used to model local variation in malaria risk over and above that which is
predicted by the regression model.
RESULTS: The method is illustrated by a map showing the improvement of risk
prediction brought about by the second stage. The advantages and shortcomings of 
this approach are discussed in the context of the need for further development of
methodology and software.

Canada.

The objective of this study is to determine the effect of permethrin
insecticide-treated bed net (PITN) use on the incidence of febrile episodes and
on household malaria expenses in Benin. Over the course of one year, 208 randomly
selected PITN user and non-user households were visited weekly to determine
expenditures on febrile morbidity and its treatment, and to monitor spending on
malaria prevention. Multivariate analyses were performed to distinguish the
effects of PITN use from other important determinants of morbidity, such as
malaria-related beliefs and practices, income, and other socio-economic
variables. Results from the logistic regression analysis show that the use of
PITNs decreases the risk of febrile episodes by 34% in children living in the
rural zone. Multiple regression analysis reveals that PITN use does not reduce
prevention and treatment expenses. These expenses are significantly associated
with women's income. This report also discusses other factors associated with
febrile morbidity and malaria-related expenditures.

(1)Churches Medical Association of Zambia, Lusaka, Zambia.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate if severe malarial anaemia is associated with a
specific immune response pattern, we determined serum levels of neopterin (a
marker of activation of macrophages by interferon-gamma) and of the
anti-inflammatory cytokines, interleukins 4 and 10.
METHODS: Zambian children < 6 years of age presenting to a rural hospital with
cerebral malaria were studied. Twenty-one children with admission haemoglobin
concentrations </= 5 g/dl were classified as having severe anaemia and 40 with
haemoglobin concentrations >/= 7 g/dl served as a control group.
RESULTS: Logistic regression modelling indicated that a 10-fold rise in serum
neopterin concentrations was associated with a 50-fold increase in the estimated 
odds of having severe anaemia (P = 0.015), while a 10-fold rise in serum
interleukin 4 concentrations was associated with a 10-fold decrease in the
estimated odds of having severe anaemia (P = 0.023). Increasing serum interleukin
10 concentrations, measured in less than half of the subjects, were associated
with a nonsignificant reduction in the odds of having severe anaemia (P = 0.095).
CONCLUSION: Development of severe malarial anaemia may be directly associated
with serum neopterin concentrations and inversely correlated with serum
interleukin 4 levels.

High immunoglobulin G2 (IgG2) and low IgG4 levels are associated with human
resistance to Plasmodium falciparum malaria.

There is accumulating evidence for a role of immunoglobulin G (IgG) in protection
against malarial infection and disease. Only IgG1 and IgG3 are considered
cytophilic and protective against P. falciparum, whereas IgG2 and IgG4 were
thought to be neither and even to block protective mechanisms. However, no clear 
pattern of association between isotypes and protection has so far emerged. We
analyzed the isotypic distribution of the IgG response to conserved epitopes and 
P. falciparum blood-stage extract in 283 malaria-exposed individuals whose
occurrence of infection and malaria attack had been monitored for about 1 year.
Logistic regression analyses showed that, at the end of the season of
transmission, high levels of IgG2 to RESA and to MSP2 epitopes were associated
with low risk of infection. Indeed, IgG2 is able to bind FcgammaRIIA in
individuals possessing the H131 allele, and we showed that 70% of the study
subjects had this allele. Also, high specific IgG4 levels were associated with an
enhanced risk of infection and with a high risk of malaria attack. Moreover,
specific IgG2 and IgG3 levels, as well as the IgG2/IgG4 and IgG3/IgG4 ratios,
increased with the age of subjects, in parallel with the protection against
infection and disease. IgG4 likely competes with cytophilic antibodies for
antigen recognition and may therefore block cytotoxicity mediated by
antibody-activated effector cells. In conclusion, these results favor a
protective role of IgG3 and IgG2, which may activate effector cells through
FcgammaRIIA, and provide evidence for a blocking role of IgG4 in malarial
infection and disease.

Diagnostic accuracy of physician review, expert algorithms and data-derived
algorithms in adult verbal autopsies.

Quigley MA(1), Chandramohan D, Rodrigues LC.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, London School of Hygiene and
Tropical Medicine, UK.

BACKGROUND: The verbal autopsy (VA) is used to collect information on
cause-specific mortality from bereaved relatives. A cause of death may be
assigned by physician review of the questionnaires, or by an algorithm. We
compared the diagnostic accuracy of physician review, an expert algorithm, and
data-derived algorithms.
METHODS: Data were drawn from a multicentre validation study of 796 adult deaths 
that occurred in hospitals in Tanzania, Ethiopia, and Ghana. A 'gold standard'
cause of death was assigned using hospital records and death certificates. The VA
interviews were carried out by trained fieldworkers 1-21 months after the
subject's death. A cause of death was assigned by physician review and an expert 
algorithm. Data-derived algorithms that most accurately estimated the
cause-specific mortality fraction (CSMF) for each cause of death were identified 
using logistic regression.
RESULTS: The most common causes of death were tuberculosis/AIDS (CSMF = 18.6%),
malaria (CSMF = 10.7%), meningitis (CSMF = 8.3%), and cardiovascular disorders
(CSMF = 8.2%). The CSMF obtained using physician review was within +/-20% of the 
gold standard value for 12 causes of death including the four common causes. The 
CSMF obtained using the expert algorithm was within +/-20% of the gold standard
for eight causes of death, including tuberculosis/AIDS, malaria, and meningitis. 
The CSMF obtained using the data-derived algorithms was within +/-20% of the gold
standard for seven causes of death, including tuberculosis/ AIDS, meningitis, and
cardiovascular disorders. All three methods yielded a specificity of at least 80%
for all causes of death, and a sensitivity of at least 80% for deaths due to
injuries and rabies.
CONCLUSIONS: For those settings where physician review is not feasible, expert
and data-derived algorithms provide an alternative approach for assigning many
causes of death. We recommend that the algorithms proposed herein are validated
further.

Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum cerebral malaria in a
chloroquine-susceptible area.

Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum is endemic in many areas. Saudi
Arabia was considered to have chloroquine-susceptible P. falciparum. During the
1997-1998 season, an outbreak of malaria occurred in the southwestern region.
Over a 4-month period, 32 cases (6.2%) of 520 malaria admissions met the World
Health Organization criteria for cerebral malaria. The mean patient age was 28
years. Thirteen male and 19 female patients were admitted in coma. The mean
duration of coma was 4.3 days; the case fatality rate was 41%. Compared with
those who recovered, patients who died had a lower mean admission diastolic blood
pressure and hemoglobin level, higher mean blood urea nitrogen and blood glucose 
levels, and thrombocytopenia. Logistic regression analysis identified treatment
with quinine rather than chloroquine to be associated with survival. These
findings show the potential of P. falciparum to emerge as chloroquine resistant
in previously susceptible areas, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality
in spite of sophisticated medical care.

Malaria remains the most important parasitic cause of mortality in humans. Its
presentation is thought to vary according to the intensity of Plasmodium
falciparum transmission. However, detailed descriptions of presenting features
and risk factors for death are only available from moderate transmission
settings. Such descriptions help to improve case management and identify priority
research areas. Standardized systematic procedures were used to collect clinical 
and laboratory data on 6,624 children admitted to hospital over a 1-year period
in an intensely malarious part of Tanzania. Frequencies of signs and symptoms
were calculated and their association with a fatal outcome was assessed using
multivariate logistic regression. There were 72 deaths among 2,432 malaria cases 
(case fatality rate [CFR] = 3.0%); 44% of the cases and 54% of the deaths were in
individuals less than 1 year of age. There was no association between level of
parasitemia and CFR. Increased risk of dying was independently found in all
children with hypoglycemia (odds ratio [OR] = 6.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] =
3.9-11.7), in children 1-7 months of age with tachypnea (OR = 8.8, 95% CI =
2.6-30.5) and dehydration (OR = 5.0, 95% CI = 1.9-14.2), and in children 8 months
to 4 years of age with chest indrawing (OR = 4.7, 95% CI = 2.0-11.2) and
inability to localize a painful stimulus (OR = 6.9, 95% CI = 2.9-16.5). Children 
in the bottom quartile of weight-for-age were more likely to die (OR = 2.1, 95%
CI = 1.3-3.5). Eight percent of the malaria cases had severe anemia (packed cell 
volume < 15%) but 24% received a blood transfusion. The epidemiology of malaria
disease may be more complex than previously thought. Improved case management in 
a wide variety of health facilities may result from adequate identification and
treatment of dehydration and hypoglycemia. Transfusion-requiring anemia is a
major problem and sustainable, effective preventive measures are urgently needed.

Plasmodium falciparum clinical malaria in Dielmo, a holoendemic area in Senegal: 
no influence of acquired immunity on initial symptomatology and severity of
malaria attacks.

Six hundred eighty-nine Plasmodium falciparum malaria attacks were observed
during a three-year period among 226 inhabitants of the village of Dielmo,
Senegal, an area of high malaria transmission. Malaria attacks were defined as
clinical episodes with fever (body temperature > or = 38.0 degrees C) or
reporting of fever or headache or vomiting, associated with a parasite:leukocyte 
ratio above an age-dependent pyrogenic threshold identified in this population.
The symptom frequencies were tested against age, gender, and parasite density
using a random-effect logistic regression model and the study of distinguishable 
clinical presentations was carried out by multi-correspondence analysis. There
was little difference between the severity of symptoms during the initial course 
of attacks in young children and adults, and this severity was not correlated
with the duration of the pathologic episode. It was not possible to distinguish
objectively different malaria attack types according to the severity of clinical 
manifestations. In contrast, the duration of fever, symptoms, and parasite
clearance were significantly longer among the youngest children than among the
oldest children and adults. These findings suggest that of the two components of 
protective immunity, anti-parasite immunity and anti-toxic immunity, only the
first would play a major role as age increases. They suggest also that the
initial clinical presentation of malaria attacks is not predictive of the level
of protective immunity.

The factors affecting the development of patent Plasmodium falciparum
gametocytemia were assessed in 5,682 patients entered prospectively into a series
of antimalarial drug trials conducted in an area of low and seasonal transmission
on the western border of Thailand. Of the 4,565 patients with admission thick
smear assessments, 110 (2.4%) had gametocytemia. During the follow-up period 170 
(3%) of all patients developed patent gametocytemia, which in 89% had developed
by day 14 following treatment. In a multiple logistic regression model five
factors were found to be independent risk factors at presentation for the
development or persistence of gametocytemia during follow up; patent
gametocytemia on admission (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 7.8, 95% confidence
interval [CI] = 3.7-16, P < 0.001), anemia (hematocrit <30%) (AOR = 3.9, 95% CI =
2.3-6.5, P < 0.001), no coincident P. vivax malaria (AOR = 3.5, 95% CI =
1.04-11.5, P < 0.04), presentation with a recrudescent infection (AOR = 2.3, 95% 
CI = 1.3-4.1, P < 0.004), and a history of illness longer than two days (AOR =
3.3, 95% CI = 1.7-6.6, P < 0.001). Patients whose infections responded slowly to 
treatment or recrudesced subsequently were also more likely to carry gametocytes 
than those who responded rapidly or were cured (relative risks = 1.9, 95% CI =
1.3-2.7 and 2.8, 95% CI = 2.0-4.0, respectively; P < 0.001). These data provide
further evidence of important epidemiologic interactions between P. falciparum
and P. vivax, and drug resistance and transmission potential.

Low birthweight in infants born to African HIV-infected women: relationship with 
maternal body weight during pregnancy: Pregnancy and HIV Study Group (EGE).

The effect of maternal HIV infection on birthweight was estimated. In the
prenatal clinic of the Centre Hospitalier de Kigali, HIV screening was proposed
to women with a gestational age (GA) of less than 28 weeks. HIV-infected (HIV+)
and uninfected (HIV-) women were recruited, when they consented. At inclusion,
socioeconomic, obstetrical data, and body weight were collected, a clinical
examination was performed, and tests for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and
malaria were performed. Two prenatal visits were made, at 28-32 and 32-36 weeks, 
with clinical data and weight measurement. At delivery, birthweight, body length,
and head circumference of the infant were documented. At inclusion and at the
second follow-up visit, HIV+ women (N = 177) weighed less than HIV- women (N =
194) (p = 0.004). Mean birthweight in infants born to HIV+ women was 2947 g (SD =
429) and 3104 g (SD = 461) in infants born to HIV- women (p = 0.001). Frequencies
of low birthweight (LBW, weight < 2500 g), prematurity (GA < 37 weeks, according 
to Finnström score at birth), and intrauterine growth retardation (defined by LBW
and GA > or = 37 weeks) were higher in infants born to HIV+ women than to HIV-
women (p = 0.009, 0.01, and 0.053, respectively). In multivariate logistic
regression, the association between maternal HIV infection and LBW disappeared (p
= 0.61), while low GA (p = 0.01) and low last prenatal weight (p = 0.01) were
independant risk factors of LBW. LBW in infants born to HIV+ women could be
partly attributable to impaired maternal weight. These results underline the need
for nutritional surveillance and dietary counselling, hoping to improve the
prognosis of pregnancy in HIV+ women, regardless of other therapeutic
interventions.

OBJECTIVES: To determine clinical correlates and outcome of hypoxaemia in
children admitted to hospital with an acute lower respiratory tract infection.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.
SETTING: Paediatric wards of the Royal Victoria Hospital and the hospital of the 
Medical Research Council's hospital in Banjul, the Gambia.
SUBJECTS: 1072 of 42 848 children, aged 2 to 33 months, who were enrolled in a
randomised trial of a Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine in the western region
of the Gambia, and who were admitted with an acute lower respiratory tract
infection to two of three hospitals.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of hypoxaemia, defined as an arterial oxygen
saturation <90% recorded by pulse oximetry, and the relation between hypoxaemia
and aetiological agents.
RESULTS: 1072 children aged 2-33 months were enrolled. Sixty three (5.9%) had an 
arterial oxygen saturation <90%. A logistic regression model showed that
cyanosis, a rapid respiratory rate, grunting, head nodding, an absence of a
history of fever, and no spontaneous movement during examination were the best
independent predictors of hypoxaemia. The presence of an inability to cry, head
nodding, or a respiratory rate >/= 90 breaths/min formed the best predictors of
hypoxaemia (sensitivity 70%, specificity 79%). Hypoxaemic children were five
times more likely to die than non-hypoxaemic children. The presence of malaria
parasitaemia had no effect on the prevalence of hypoxaemia or on its association 
with respiratory rate.
CONCLUSION: In children with an acute lower respiratory tract infection, simple
physical signs that require minimal expertise to recognise can be used to
determine oxygen therapy and to aid in screening for referral. The association
between hypoxaemia and death highlights the need for early recognition of the
condition and the potential benefit of treatment.

PIP: Acute lower respiratory tract (ALRT) infections cause considerable child
morbidity and mortality in developing countries. Oxygen therapy can improve the
outcome of children with moderate or severe ALRT infections and, in those with
hypoxemia, the severity of hypoxia correlates with outcome. However, since oxygen
is not always available in resource-poor countries, rational guidelines must be
followed for the use of oxygen and the referral of patients to specialist
hospitals. Findings are presented from a prospective cohort study conducted to
determine which clinical signs predict hypoxemia and the outcome of hypoxemia
among children admitted to hospital with ALRT infection. Findings are based upon 
the study of 1072 of 42,848 children aged 2-33 months who were enrolled in a
randomized trial of a Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine in western Gambia,
and who were admitted with an ALRT infection to 2 of 3 hospitals. 63 (5.9%) had
an arterial oxygen saturation level of less than 90%. Logistic regression found
cyanosis, a rapid respiratory rate, grunting, head nodding, absence of a history 
of fever, and no spontaneous movement during examination were significantly
associated with hypoxemia. When cyanosis may not be correctly assessed, the
inability to cry, head nodding, and a respiratory rate of at least 90
breaths/minute can be useful ways of predicting hypoxemia. Hypoxemic children
were 5 times more likely to die than were nonhypoxemic children. The presence of 
malaria parasitemia had no effect upon the prevalence of hypoxemia or upon its
association with respiratory rate.

fever.

Diagnosis of malaria in children is difficult without laboratory support because 
the symptoms and signs of malaria overlap with those of other febrile illnesses
such as pneumonia. Nevertheless, in many parts of Africa diagnosis of malaria
must be made without laboratory investigation. Therefore, a scoring system has
been developed to assist peripheral health care workers in making this diagnosis.
Four hundred and seven Gambian children aged 6 months to 9 years who presented to
a rural clinic with fever or a recent history of fever were investigated. A
diagnosis of malaria was made in 159 children who had a fever of 38 degrees C or 
more and malaria parasitaemia of 5000 parasites/microL or more. Symptoms and
signs in children with malaria were compared with those in children with other
febrile illnesses to identify features which predicted malaria. Symptoms and
signs were incorporated into various logistic regression models to test which
were best independent predictors of malaria and these regression models were used
to construct simple scoring systems which predicted malaria. A nine terms model
predicted clinical malaria with a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 61%,
values comparable to those obtained by an experienced paediatrician without
laboratory support. The ability of peripheral health care workers to diagnose
malaria using this approach is now being investigated in a prospective study.

Clinical case definitions for malaria: clinical malaria associated with very low 
parasite densities in African infants.

McGuinness D(1), Koram K, Bennett S, Wagner G, Nkrumah F, Riley E.

Author information: 
(1)Institute of Cell, Animal and Population Biology, University of Edinburgh, UK.

In areas endemic for Plasmodium falciparum, clinical malaria is believed to be
less common in infants than in older children, but specific case definitions have
rarely been determined for this age group. As malaria case definitions are known 
to be both age- and site-specific, assessment of the risk of disease in infancy
requires the development of appropriate diagnostic criteria. In southern Ghana,
154 children were recruited at birth and monitored for fever and malaria
infection until 2 years of age. Logistic regression was used to model fever risk 
as a continuous function of parasite density to determine case definitions for
the diagnosis of clinical malaria, and to determine age- and season-specific
estimates of the fraction of fevers attributable to malaria (AF); 2360
observations were made on 154 children. For fevers defined by a measured
temperature > or = 37.5 degrees C, the estimated population AF was 44% (95%
confidence interval 34-53). Estimates of AF varied with age and season. For
infants, AF was 51% during the wet season and 22% during the dry season; for
children over one year of age, AF was 89% during the wet season and 36% during
the dry season. The estimated parasite density threshold for initiation of a
febrile episode was 100 parasites per microL of blood in infants, compared with
3500 parasites per microL for children over one year of age. Using these case
definitions, the incidence of clinical malaria was estimated at 0.09 cases per
child-year at risk for children less than 6 months of age, 0.40 for children aged
6-11 months, and 0.69 for children aged 12-23 months. Of 66 cases of clinical
malaria, only 3 were observed in children under 5 months of age. We concluded
that, although most fevers in infants are not due to malaria, infant clinical
malaria may occur at extremely low parasite densities. This may be indicative of 
a lack of anti-disease immunity in this age group. In southern Ghana, an infant
with axillary temperature > or = 37.5 degrees C and parasitaemia > or =
100/microL should be considered to have clinical malaria. Nevertheless, the
incidence of clinical malaria is very low in children under 6 months of age,
confirming that they are significantly protected from clinical malaria compared
to older children.

Levels of tumour necrosis factor and soluble TNF receptors during malaria fever
episodes in the community.

The pyrogenic cytokine, tumour necrosis factor (TNF), is a mediator of malaria
fever. Since high plasma levels of TNF are sometimes found in afebrile
individuals with Plasmodium falciparum parasitaemia, it has been suggested that
soluble forms of TNF receptors (sTNF-R55 and sTNF-R75) in the plasma may act to
inhibit the pyrogenic effect of TNF. We have investigated plasma levels of TNF,
sTNF-R55 and sTNF-R75 in relation to episodes of malaria fever detected in a
cross-sectional study of 313 rural Gambian children during the malaria
transmission season. Levels of TNF were significantly higher in the 20 children
who had parasitaemia associated with fever than in 120 children who were afebrile
despite malaria infection and 173 who had no detectable parasitaemia. In
contrast, soluble TNF receptor levels did not differ between these clinical
groups and, in a logistic regression model which included level of parasitaemia, 
we found TNF but not soluble TNF receptor levels to be associated with the
presence of fever. These data support the role of TNF in malaria fever but
suggest that soluble TNF receptors are not a major factor in modulating the
fever.

Effectiveness of chemoprophylaxis and other determinants of malaria in travellers
to Kenya.

Muehlberger N(1), Jelinek T, Schlipkoeter U, von Sonnenburg F, Nothdurft HD.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Public Health and Epidemiology, University of Munich, Germany.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effectiveness of chemoprophylaxis and the
determinants of malaria importation from Kenya.
METHOD: In a population-based case-control study, 51 travellers from Bavaria
diagnosed with falciparum malaria imported from Kenya (cases) and a sample of 383
healthy Bavarian travellers returning from Kenya (controls) were interviewed.
Data were analysed by multiple logistic regression.
RESULTS: Mefloquine (OR = 0.055; 95% CI 0.019-0.16) and chloroquine combined with
proguanil (OR = 0.128; 95% CI 0.039-0.419) were highly protective against P.
falciparum malaria, whereas other drugs were ineffective (OR = 1.225; 95% CI
0.536-2.803). Ineffective prophylaxis (10.4%) and non-prophylaxis (11.2%) were
the main reasons for malaria importation. Travelling alone or with friends, male 
sex, and travel duration over 4 weeks could be identified as additional risk
factors. The main reason for inadequate chemoprophylaxis was inappropriate
medical advice (87.5%). Prophylaxis refusal occurred frequently despite correct
advice (58.1%). Diagnosis was often delayed unnecessarily (27.5%).
CONCLUSION: Malaria importation from Kenya could be reduced substantially (34%)
by eliminating inappropriate medical advice.

Improving antenatal care for pregnant adolescents in southern Malawi.

Brabin L(1), Verhoeff FH, Kazembe P, Brabin BJ, Chimsuku L, Broadhead R.

Author information: 
(1)Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, United Kingdom.

BACKGROUND: This paper considers why antenatal care (ANC) programs for
adolescents may need to be improved in areas where a high proportion of first
pregnancies are to young girls.
DESIGN: Descriptive data on the characteristics of 615 adolescents (aged 10-19
years) who attended for a first antenatal care visit at two rural hospitals in
southern Malawi are given. For the 41.5% who came for a supervised delivery,
details of their pregnancy care and delivery outcome are provided. The Chi-square
test is used for determining significant differences between age and parity
groups and logistic regression for an analysis of low birthweight.
RESULTS: Fifty-two percent of girls were nulliparous, 24.5% were < or =16 years
and 73.3% were illiterate. Prevalence of anemia, malaria and HIV infection was
high. Girls who were nulliparous, illiterate, made early antenatal care visits or
gave a history of stillbirth or abortion were less likely to attend for delivery.
Few primiparae required an assisted vaginal delivery or cesarean section but
primiparae had more adverse birth outcomes. Forty percent of primiparae <17 years
gave birth to low birthweight babies as did 28.3% of multiparae. In a logistic
regression (all adolescents) low birthweight was correlated with literacy
(p=0.03) and number of antenatal care visits (p=0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Pregnancy morbidity and adverse birth outcomes were common in spite 
of antenatal care attendance. This partly reflects poor management of malaria
during pregnancy. In areas like Malawi, where childbearing starts early, girls in
their first pregnancy need good quality care and careful monitoring if problems
are not to be perpetuated to a second pregnancy. Many girls start pregnancy with 
HIV and schistosomal infections which indicates the need for programs before
girls become pregnant.

PIP: A descriptive study of 615 girls 10-19 years of age attending their first
prenatal visit at 2 rural hospitals in southern Malawi revealed a need to improve
the quality of antenatal care for this high-risk group. 52% of teens were
nulliparous and 73.3% were illiterate. Most nulliparae first attended for
antenatal care at 20-23 weeks of gestation, while multiparae tended to report at 
24-27 weeks. The mean number of antenatal visits was high: 5.3. 26.6% of pregnant
adolescents were HIV-infected, 34.4% had malaria, and 92.6% were anemic. Details 
of pregnancy outcome were available only for the 251 girls (41.5%) who presented 
for supervised delivery. Girls who were nulliparous, illiterate, made early
antenatal care visits, or gave a history of stillbirth or abortion were less
likely to attend for delivery. 40% of primiparae under 17 years of age and 28.3% 
of multiparae had a low-birth-weight infant. Logistic regression analysis
indicated that low birth weight was significantly inversely associated with
literacy and number of antenatal care visits. The prevalence of peripheral
parasitemia was as high at delivery as at first antenatal visit, indicating that 
malaria control during pregnancy was not performed or was not effective. These
findings indicate that, when adolescent pregnancy begins at an early age, girls
in their first and second pregnancies require intensive monitoring. On the other 
hand, in settings such as Malawi, where many young girls are anemic and
HIV-infected when they become pregnant and have infections such as
schistosomiasis that cannot be treated during pregnancy, programs must be
initiated to improve the health status and literacy of young girls before they
reach childbearing age.

We studied the aetiology of malnutrition in a cohort of 1511 children < 10 years 
old in Espiritu Santo, Vanuatu. Malnutrition was categorized using standard
anthropometric criteria as: underweight [weight-for-age (WA) Z score < -2],
wasting [weight-for-height (WH) Z < -2], or stunting [height-for-age (HA) Z <
-2]. On multiple logistic regression analysis, the only factors significantly
associated with wasting were age < 5 years [OR (95% CI) 1.8 (1.2-2.9), p = 0.01] 
and having suffered one or more episodes of clinical P. vivax malaria in the 6
months preceding nutritional assessment [OR 2.4 (1.3-4.4), p = 0.006]. The
incidence of P. vivax infection was significantly higher during the 6 months
preceding assessment in underweight vs. non-underweight children [incidence rate 
ratio (IRR) 2.6 (1.5-4.4), p < or = 0.0001). These groups had similar incidences 
of clinical P. falciparum infection during the same period [IRR 1.1 (0.57-2.1) p 
= 0.8] and of either species during the 6 months following assessment [IRR P.
vivax 1.3 (0.9-2.0) p = 0.2; IRR P. falciparum 1.3 (0.9-1.9) p = 0.2]. In these
children, P. vivax malaria was a major predictor of acute malnutrition; P.
falciparum was not. Wasting neither predisposed to nor protected against malaria 
of either species. Although P. vivax malaria is generally regarded as benign, it 
may produce considerable global mortality through malnutrition.

PIP: The etiology of malnutrition was investigated in a cohort of all 1511
children under 10 years of age living in 13 villages in the island of Espiritu
Santo, Vanuatu, where malaria is endemic. 18% of children under 5 years were
underweight, 5% were wasted, and 20% were stunted. The mean weight-for-age Z
score for the 1114 children resident in hyperendemic villages was significantly
lower (-0.99) than that of the 397 children living in the mesoendemic area
(-0.77). According to multiple logistic regression analysis, the only factors
significantly associated with wasting in the hyperendemic area were age under 5
years (odds ratio (OR), 1.8; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.2-2.9) and 1 or more
episodes of clinical Plasmodium vivax malaria in the 6 months preceding
nutritional assessment (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.3-4.4). Only male sex and low birth
weight were significantly associated with stunting. The incidence of P. vivax
infection in the 6 months preceding the survey was significantly higher in
underweight compared to non-underweight children (relative risk (RR), 2.6; 95%
CI, 1.5-4.4). The incidence of P. falciparum malaria was not significantly
different between groups, suggesting that this is not a major cause of
malnutrition on the island. Wasting neither predisposed to nor protected against 
malaria of either species. Although P. vivax malaria is generally regarded as
benign, it may produce substantial global mortality through malnutrition.

Imbalanced distribution of Plasmodium falciparum MSP-1 genotypes related to
sickle-cell trait.

Ntoumi F(1), Rogier C, Dieye A, Trape JF, Millet P, Mercereau-Puijalon O.

Author information: 
(1)Unité d'Imunologie Moléculaire des Parasites, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.

BACKGROUND: The sickle-cell trait protects against severe Plasmodium falciparum
malaria and reduces susceptibility to mild malaria but does not prevent
infection. The exact mechanism of this protection remains unclear. We have
hypothesized that AS individuals are protected by virtue of being less
susceptible to a subset of parasite strains; thus we compared some genetic
characteristics of parasites infecting AS and AA subjects.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood was collected from asymptomatic individuals living
in two different regions of Africa. The polymorphic MSP-1 and MSP-2 loci were
genotyped using a PCR-based methodology. Individual alleles were identified by
size polymorphism, amplification using family-specific primers, and hybridization
using family-specific probes. Multivariate logistic regression was used to
analyze allele distribution.
RESULTS: In Senegalese carriers, age and hemoglobin type influenced differently
the distribution of the three MSP-1 families and had an impact on distinct
individual alleles, whereas the distribution of MSP-2 alleles was marginally
affected. There was no influence of other genetic traits, including the HLA Bw53 
genotype, or factors such as place of residence within the village. In a cohort
of Gabonese schoolchildren in which the influence of age was abrogated, a similar
imbalance in the MSP-1 allelic distribution but not of MSP-2 allelic distribution
by hemoglobin type was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: The influence of the host's hemoglobin type on P. falciparum
genotypes suggests that parasite fitness for a specific host is strain-dependent,
which is consistent with our hypothesis that innate resistance might result from 
reduced fitness of some parasite strains for individuals with sickle-cell traits.

Mothers' management of childhood diseases in Yorubaland: the influence of
cultural beliefs.

Feyisetan BJ(1), Asa S, Ebigbola JA.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Demography and Social Statistics, Obafemi Awolowo University,
Ile-Ife, Nigeria.

Several studies have noted that, besides inadequate availability of health care
services in many areas, especially the less developed countries, certain
disease-specific and non-disease-specific cultural beliefs may influence people's
health seeking behaviour. It has even been noted that health services may be
underutilized and several health and child care instructions may be ineffective
or ignored in traditional and transitional societies where people's ideas and
behavioural patterns conflict with the knowledge being passed to them (Feyisetan 
and Adeokun 1992; Feyisetan 1992). Feyisetan and Adeokun (1992) argued that
non-adoption of modern preventive and curative measures cannot be attributed to
poverty alone since the costs of some preventive and curative measures are not
exorbitant in several of these societies. Rather, they suggested that the gap
between awareness of modern health measures and health seeking behaviour must be 
sought in the social and cultural determinants of behaviour in such matters as
child care and disease management. Earlier studies have noted that children in
Nigeria die mainly from malaria, diarrhoea, measles, neonatal tetanus, whooping
cough, tuberculosis, and bronchopneumonia (Morley and MacWilliam 1961; Ogunlesi
1961; Morley, Woodland and Martin 1963, 1966; Baxter-Grillo and Leshi 1964;
Animashaun 1977; Tomkins 1981). Because these diseases are preventable at low
cost to the individual, there is a need to investigate why large percentages of
children are still subjected to many episodes of these diseases. In this paper,
we examine (1) the mothers' perceptions of the aetiology of the three most cited 
childhood diseases in our study areas, measles, diarrhoea and fever, and the
effect of these perceptions on the mothers' suggested curative measures; and (2) 
the persistence of the belief in abiku and how this cultural belief can influence
mothers' management of childhood diseases. Since, for most mothers, perceptions
of the aetiology of the childhood diseases are rooted in cultural beliefs, a
brief review of disease-specific cultural beliefs is undertaken. In order to
determine the effect of socio-economic factors, the mothers' perceptions of the
aetiology of the childhood diseases, their recommended curative measures and the 
belief in abiku are examined according to selected socio-economic variables.

PIP: This study examines data from a two-round survey undertaken in September
1991 and April-May 1992 in Nigeria to reveal the "Impact of Cultural Beliefs and 
Practices on Child Health among the Yoruba." Data were analyzed to determine 1)
mothers' perceptions of the etiology of measles, diarrhea, and fever and the
effect of these beliefs on which curative measures they suggested and 2) the
persistence of the belief in "abiku" (special children who have come from the
spirit world and can die at will unless certain rituals are performed) and how
this belief can influence the way mothers manage childhood diseases. The data for
this study, collected via formal interviews with 1559 respondents supplemented by
in-depth interviews and focus group discussions, were submitted to simple cross
tabulation and logistic regression analysis. It was found that 1) many of the
mothers lack accurate information about the causes of the selected childhood
diseases, especially measles; 2) many of the mothers nevertheless recommended
modern curative methods; 3) the belief in abiku remains strong among these
mothers; and 4) the curative measures adopted by a mother may depend upon whether
the sick child is believed to an abiku. Over half of the mothers believed that an
abiku required treatment from traditional healers and religious institutions
irrespective of the nature of the illness. Thus, the probability of a child
receiving modern curative treatment depends upon whether or not that child is
perceived to be abiku. This study underscores the need to consider local beliefs 
and practices when implementing health policies.

Exchange blood transfusion in severe falciparum malaria: retrospective evaluation
of 61 patients treated with, compared to 63 patients treated without, exchange
transfusion.

The rationale for exchange blood transfusion (ET) in severe falciparum malaria is
threefold: reduction of parasitaemia, reduction of presumptive 'toxic' factors,
and improvement of the rheological quality of the blood. We evaluated the records
of 61 patients treated with ET to describe the present status of malaria
treatment in Germany, Austria and Switzerland and to assess the efficacy of ET.
Clinical data of 61 patients treated with ET were compared to data of 63 patients
treated in 2 hospitals where ETs were generally not performed. We found that
exchange transfusion is applied according to the clinician's subjective
impression rather than strict guidelines. Logistic regression analysis adjusting 
for the differences in clinical parameters between patients treated with or
without ET did not identify treatment as a prognostic indicator (odds ratio for
relative risk of death with ET: 1.3; 95% CI: 0.4-4.9). Exchange transfusion did
not significantly improve the unfavourable prognosis in cases of severe
falciparum malaria. However, failure to reach statistical significance may be due
to the retrospective design of the study and therefore non-systematic approach.

Anti-malarial drug resistance, malnutrition and socio-economic status.

Germany.

To investigate the relationship between nutritional status and resistance to
chloroquine treatment, we designed a nested case-control study prospective with
respective to the outcome of Plasmodium falciparum-infected school children aged 
5-14 years from Honiara, Solomon Islands. 38 chloroquine-resistant cases were
compared with treatment-susceptible controls with respect to current nutritional 
status, behavioural characteristics, medical and demographic data. The overall
prevalence of moderate malnutrition was 28%. The incidence rate of chloroquine
resistance was 23%. Malnourished children were generally at higher risk for
treatment failure than well-nourished ones (OR: 3.6; 95% CI: 1.6-8.4; P = 0.001).
This effect was modified by socio-economic status. Stratified analysis by
logistic regression resulted in an eightfold risk of resistance for malnourished 
children in the higher socio-economic category (OR: 8.1; 95% CI: 2.4-27.9; P =
-.0001). In children from the lower socio-economic group, the effect of
malnutrition was not significant (OR: 1.5; 95% CI: 0.4-5.6). Socio-economic
differences may affect the immune status. The treatment response in children of
lower socio-economic status, which are more exposed to malaria, may therefore be 
less affected by malnutrition.

Author information:

Kingdom.

BACKGROUND: Cerebral malaria is an important cause of pediatric hospital
admissions in the tropics. It commonly leads to neurologic sequelae, but the risk
factors for this remain unclear and the long-term outcome unknown.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to identify the common forms of
neurologic sequelae that occur after cerebral malaria, their evolution over time,
and the major clinical risk factors for residual disability.
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective study in 624 children admitted with cerebral malaria to
two hospitals in The Gambia, West Africa.
RESULTS: We found that 23.3% of survivors had neurologic sequelae on discharge
from the hospital. By 1 month the proportion had decreased to 8.6%, and at 6
months only 4.4% of survivors were found to have residual neurologic sequelae.
The most common forms of neurologic sequelae were paresis and ataxia, often found
in combination with other neurologic abnormalities. In a multiple logistic
regression analysis, depth of coma on admission, multiple convulsions, and
duration of unconsciousness were the only three independent risk factors.
Hypoglycemia and lactate acidosis were not predictive of sequelae, although they 
are important risk factors for fatality.
CONCLUSION: This finding raises the possibility that fatal outcome and neurologic
sequelae arise from separate pathologic processes.

Predictors of a fatal outcome following childhood cerebral malaria.

Jaffar S(1), Van Hensbroek MB, Palmer A, Schneider G, Greenwood B.

Author information: 
(1)Medical Research Council Laboratories, Banjul, The Gambia.

Despite prompt treatment with an effective anti-malarial drug, cerebral malaria
still has a mortality of 20-30%. To identify factors that may contribute to this 
high fatality rate, we have studied the relationship between clinical and
laboratory features and a fatal outcome in 624 Gambian children with strictly
defined cerebral malaria. One hundred twenty-four children (21.5%) died.
Three-quarters of the deaths occurred within 24 hr of admission. Multiple
logistic regression analysis showed that a cold periphery (odds ratio [OR] =
2.7), a deep coma (OR = 2.0), and hypoglycemia (OR = 4.1) were the clinical signs
and laboratory parameters that predicted death most strongly. More than 90% of
the children who died had at least one of these conditions. Also, children with
elevated urea levels on admission or those who experienced multiple episodes of
hypoglycemia or multiple convulsions subsequently were more likely to die. A
combination of clinical and laboratory abnormalities can identify a group of
children with cerebral malaria who are most at risk of dying, who require
intensive care and who are candidates for new forms of therapy.

Criteria for better detection of brucellosis in the Narok District of Kenya.

Muriuki SM(1), McDermott JJ, Arimi SM, Mugambi JT, Wamola IA.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Infectious Diseases, National Museums of Kenya, Karen, Nairobi.

Monthly disease summary sheets from 1986-1992 of 60 dispensaries, clinics and
hospitals in Narok district, Kenya were reviewed for the occurrence of
brucellosis and other diseases with "flu-like symptoms". Diseases with these
symptoms accounted for about 52% of the 1,037,875 cases reported for the time
period. These were classified as malaria (79.3%), rheumatism (7.1%), PUO (2.4%), 
and brucellosis (0.8%). Brucellosis was diagnosed by a positive Rose Bengal (RB) 
test routinely conducted in seven out of the 60 health units. In these units, 55%
of flu-like cases were classified as malaria and 21.2% as brucellosis. Individual
case records of patients at four dispensaries using the RB test during 1991-92
were assessed for specific predictor symptoms. For 625 RB tested patients, a
positive test result was associated with joint pain, headache, and the
combinations of joint pain with headache and lameness with headache. A logistic
regression model correctly predicted the RB test result in 62.3% of the time. For
the 465 patients examined by the blood smear examination, identification of
malaria parasites was associated with, headache, joint pain and combinations of
emesis with pale mucous membranes. This regression model correctly predicted
positive results 67.2% of the time. Both models indicate that selected clinical
predictors represented significantly increased odds of being positive to the
respective tests. However, for both diseases, clinical signs alone appear
insufficient for reliable diagnosis and differentiation probably due to
resemblance in symptomatology between these two and other diseases.

(1)Dept. of Community Medicine.

The city of Mangalore in South India was having increasing number of malaria
cases from 1990. Concerned over the import of cases through migrant construction 
workers, a screening was done among them using clinical and parasitological
methods. This demonstrated 6.28% slide positivity rate with statistically
insignificant difference in prevalence of infection between males and females.
There were many asymptomatic individuals reporting positive only on peripheral
smear examination. Yet, clinical symptoms like fever were found to have good
predictive value on logistic regression. It was more so with the P. falciparum
which is a relatively new entrant to Mangalore.

Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., Basel, Switzerland.

Background: There is a perceived increased health risk in senior visitors to
malaria endemic countries. Methods: The authors sought to compare effectiveness
and tolerability of malaria chemoprophylaxis in senior travelers (>=60 years)
with those in younger travelers (20-59 years). The "Malpro 2" database consists
of more than 100,000 questionnaires completed by travelers on charter planes
returning from East Africa to Europe during July 1988-December 1991. Among them, 
9106 (9.1%) of the travelers were 60 years or older, and 84,562 (84.6%) of the
travelers reported to be 20-59 years. Variables of demography, travel data, and
the effectiveness and tolerability of chemoprophylaxis were compared in the two
subgroups. Results: Malaria in Africa was reported by 8 (1/1000) elderly
travelers and by 189 (2.2/1000) travelers aged 20-59 years. Adjusting for age,
sex, prophylaxis, and duration of stay in Africa in a logistic regression model, 
malaria was significantly more frequent in younger than in senior travelers
(p<.05). Any travel-associated illness was reported by 7.0% in the senior age
group and by 13.6% in the younger age group (p<.05). The rates of travelers who
indicated they had "side effects" attributable to malaria prophylaxis varied
between 9.7% in the elderly and 15.5% in the younger travelers (p<.05).
Conclusion: Senior travelers tolerate malaria chemoprophylaxis and visits to the 
tropics at least as well as younger travelers.

Studies of the prevalence and incidence of malaria were conducted in children <
10 years old living in 10 rural villages on the island of Espiritu Santo,
Vanuatu, south-west Pacific. Malaria prevalence remained stable at 30% throughout
the year but the relative contributions of the 2 major species were highly
dependent on season. Plasmodium falciparum predominated in the long wet season
(November-May) and P. vivax in the dry season (June-October). Case definitions
for malaria, derived using a multiple logistic regression method, showed that
parasite densities associated with clinical disease were low; case definitions
for P. falciparum (> 1000 parasites/microL in children > 1 year old and > 500
microL in infants) and P. vivax (> 500 parasites/microL at all ages) were both
associated with a specificity and sensitivity of > 90%. Like prevalence data,
malaria morbidity was highly seasonal; 80% of clinical P. falciparum infections
occurred in the wet season and 66% of clinical P. vivax in the dry season. Mixed 
infections were rare. Malaria was important cause of morbidity with children < 5 
years old experiencing 1.3-3.0 episodes of clinical malaria per year and 23% of
fevers being attributable to malaria in this age group. Children aged 5-9 years
continued to suffer one episode of clinical malaria per year. The peak incidence 
of P. vivax malaria occurred earlier in life than the peak incidence of P.
falciparum malaria. The possible interactions between these 2 parasite species
are discussed.

Risk factors of chloroquine resistance in Plasmodium falciparum malaria.

Hess FI(1), Iannuzzi A, Leafasia J, Cowdrey D, Nothdurft HD, Von Sonnenburg F,
Löscher T, Rieckmann KH.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Tropical Medicine, University of Munich, Germany.

OBJECTIVE: To identify patient-related risk factors of chloroquine resistance.
DESIGN: A case control study.
SUBJECTS: Plasmodium falciparum infected school children were followed
prospectively for 7 days for the detection of chloroquine resistance. Cases were 
38 individuals with chloroquine resistant infections. Controls were 125
individuals with chloroquine sensitive infections. Cases were compared with
controls with respect to previous or current study factor levels. Subjects were
recruited from randomly selected schools which were stratified for area. Study
location was in North Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands.
OUTCOME MEASURE: Treatment failure of chloroquine in standard dosage (25 mg/kg). 
Follow-up period was 7 days.
RESULTS: Logistic regression resulted in 5 independent significant predictors of 
chloroquine resistance, obtained simultaneously with the diagnosis of malarial
infection: (i) Young age (odds ratio (OR) for age < 7 years: 7.1; 95% confidence 
interval (CI): 2.5-25.0; OR per year increase after the age of 5 years: 0.8; 95% 
CI: 0.6-0.9). (ii) High parasite density (OR for > 1000/microliters: 5.0; 95% CI:
2.0-10.6; OR per 500 parasites/microliters increase: 1.3; 95% CI: 1.1-1.7). (iii)
Normal spleen size (OR: 4.0, 95% CI; 1.5-10.8). (iv) Malnutrition (OR: 4.9; 95%
CI: 1.8-13.2). (v) Presence of gametocytes in the thick smear (OR: 3.0; 95% CI:
1.1-8.0).
CONCLUSION: The identified risk factors are easily measurable without special
equipment. They may be useful for health workers in the Solomon Islands, even in 
remote areas, to identify Plasmodium falciparum infected individuals at high risk
for chloroquine resistance before a treatment decision is made.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Medicine, University of Natal, Durban.

Comment in
    S Afr Med J. 1996 Nov;86(11):1429-30.

OBJECTIVE: To describe severe and complicated malaria, including the common
complications, causes of death and predictors of poor outcome.
DESIGN: Retrospective case series.
SETTING: King Edward VIII Hospital, Durban, Natal, a referral centre.
PATIENTS: One hundred and forty-three consecutive patients (88 males, 55 females;
median age 25 years, range 2-86 years) admitted with a microscopic diagnosis of
Plasmodium falciparum malaria from 1984 to 1991.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A univariate analysis comparing survival and death for
categorical and continuous data for various complications was performed using the
t-test or chi 2-test (or Fisher's exact test in the case of small cell sizes).
Variables that showed significance on univariate analysis (P < 0.1) were used in 
a multivariate analysis to determine which contributed independently to survival 
or death.
RESULTS: The case fatality rate was 11.1% (15/135) and the commonest
complications were hyperparasitaemia (30%), renal failure (17%), acidaemia (14%),
jaundice (10.4%) and cerebral malaria (6%). The commonest complications in
patients who died were renal failure (10 patients), cerebral malaria (7),
hyperparasitaemia (6) and severe anaemia (5). Multivariate analysis using a
logistic regression model showed a high parasite load and cerebral malaria
(relative risks of 11.9 and 51.8 respectively) and high urea levels to be the
significant predictors of poor outcome (95% confidence intervals 1.53-91.9,
2.74-100.0 and 1.01-1.09, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with high parasite densities, cerebral involvement and
renal dysfunction need urgent attention with parenteral chemotherapy, intravenous
fluid replacement and early referral to a tertiary hospital with facilities for
intensive monitoring and supportive treatment.

Multiple infection with Plasmodium and helminths in communities of low and
relatively high socio-economic status.

Tshikuka JG(1), Scott ME, Gray-Donald K, Kalumba ON.

Author information: 
(1)Institute of Parasitology, Macdonald Campus, McGill University, St-Anne de
Bellevue, Canada.

A study was conducted in the city of Lubumbashi, Zaire: (1) to survey parasitic
infections and clinical conditions in the local children and their mothers; (2)
to identify combinations of parasites and clinical conditions that commonly
occurred together in individuals; and (3) to determine whether single- and/or
multiple-species infections were risk determinants of the observed clinical
conditions. Overall, 1100 children and mothers from three subdivisions, two of
low socio-economic status (LSES) and one of relatively high socio-economic status
(HSES), provided stool and blood samples and were clinically examined. Plasmodium
prevalence was higher in the two LSES subdivisions than in the HSES subdivision. 
Prevalence and intensity of Ascaris lumbricoides infection were low in the HSES
subdivision and one of the two LSES subdivisions. In contrast, prevalence and
intensity of Trichuris trichiura and of hookworms were similar in all
subdivisions. Plasmodium and A. lumbricoides were the most frequently found
single-species infections. The combination of A. lumbricoides and Plasmodium was 
the most frequent double-species infection and that of A. lumbricoides,
Plasmodium and T. trichiura was the most frequent triple-species infection.
Significant positive associations between parasite species were detected in the
HSES subdivision, and in one of the two LSES subdivisions. Because the
relationships were not consistently detected, it is hypothesized that the
associations are determined by environmental conditions rather than synergy
between the parasites in the host. The most commonly observed clinical conditions
were abdominal pain, diarrhoea, fever, and low packed-cell volume (PCV). The
occurrence of each was significantly lower in the HSES subdivision than in at
least one of the two LSES subdivisions. Abdominal pain and low PCV were most
common in individuals presenting with only a single clinical condition, and the
combination of this symptom and sign was the most commonly observed pair of
conditions. Abdominal pain, low PCV and diarrhoea was the most common combination
in individuals with three clinical conditions. Logistic regression revealed that 
hookworm infection, T. trichiura infection, young age and residence in an LSES
subdivision were determinants of diarrhoea. Trichuris trichiura infection, young 
age and living in an LSES subdivision were risk factors for abdominal pain.
Plasmodium infection and young age were risk factors for fever. LSES was the only
predictor of low PCV. Infection with A. lumbricoides did not enter any of the
models. No significant interactions were detected among parasites, indicating
that there was no synergism or antagonism among parasites in the induced disease.

Evidence for an age-dependent pyrogenic threshold of Plasmodium falciparum
parasitemia in highly endemic populations.

Rogier C(1), Commenges D, Trape JF.

Author information: 
(1)Institut Pasteur de Dakar, Senegal.

The high prevalence of asymptomatic malaria infections and the nonspecific signs 
and symptoms of the disease make the individual diagnosis of clinical malaria
uncertain in highly endemic areas. Longitudinal data obtained during a four-month
period from a daily survey of 200 permanent inhabitants (one month-83 years old) 
living in a holoendemic area were analyzed in a random-effects logistic
regression model to investigate the relationship between the level of Plasmodium 
falciparum parasitemia and risk of fever. It was not possible to build a model
that described/summarized correctly this relationship by a continuous function.
Findings provide evidence for an age-dependent threshold effect of parasitemia on
the occurrence of fever. The level of this threshold varied by 2.45 trophozoites 
per leukocyte, maximum at one year of age, to 0.5 trophozoites per leukocyte,
minimum at 60 years of age. When the parasite density of a person crossed the
threshold level corresponding to his or her age, the individual's risk of fever
was multiplied by 44 (95% confidence interval = 13.6-144.8). The existence of
this threshold effect allows parasite density to be used to distinguish malaria
attacks from other causes of fever within an individual and should facilitate the
accurate evaluation of the incidence of clinical malaria in highly endemic areas.

Malarial infection and birthweight in urban Zanzibar, Tanzania.

Matteelli A(1), Donato F, Shein A, Muchi JA, Abass AK, Mariani M, Leopardi O,
Maxwell CA, Carosi G.

Author information: 
(1)Clinic of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, University of Brescia, Italy.

In urban Zanzibar, Tanzania, 389 women with full-term pregnancies were studied to
see what effect their infection with malaria (at delivery) had on the birthweight
(BW) of their infants. The overall prevalence of low birthweight (LBW) (i.e. <
2500 g) was 3.9% (15 out of 389). Overall, 21.3% (82/384) of the women only had
peripheral parasitaemias at delivery, 17.6% (58/329) only had active placental
infections and 47.9% (157/328) had both. The youngest women (< 20 years), the
primiparae and those with Plasmodium infection gave birth to neonates with
relatively low mean BW. The lowest mean BW (2967 g) was found among the offspring
of women with active placental infection (N = 58). The women with past/chronic
infection (N = 73) or no infection (N = 201) generally produced heavier infants, 
with mean BW of 3242 and 3338 g, respectively. The women with active placental
infection were also far more likely to have babies of LBW (15.5%) than those with
past/chronic infection (1.4%) or no infection (1.5%). Multivariate analysis
indicated that the highest relative risk of LBW (10.1, with a 95% confidence
interval of 2.9-35.4) was associated with active placental infection, with no
significant difference between primiparae and multiparae. In the study
population, therefore, with its low prevalence of LBW, malaria infection
increased the risk of LBW in full-term neonates by about 10-fold, with a
population-attributable proportion of 55.4%.

PIP: 389 pregnant women admitted for full- term, uncomplicated delivery at the
Regional Hospital on the island of Zanzibar (Tanzania) were recruited to study
the effect of malarial infection on birth weight in an endemic area. 3.8% of all 
newborns weighed less than 2500 g (i.e., low birth weight [LBW]). 21.4% of all
women had peripheral parasitemias but no active placental infection. 17.6% had
active placental infection but no peripheral parasitemia. 47.9% had both active
placental and peripheral infections. Logistic regression analysis revealed that
active placental infection was associated with LBW (15.5% vs. 1.2%; relative risk
[RR] = 10.1, population attributable proportion [PAP] = 61.4%; p = 0.003). Serum 
albumin level less than 2.5 mg/dl was also associated with LBW (11.8% vs. 1.2%;
RR= 10.2, PAP = 61.%; p = 0.008). Overall malarial infection was associated with 
LBW (6.5% vs. 1.8%; RR = 3.5; PAP = 55.4%; p = 0.04). These findings suggest that
placental malaria causes intrauterine growth retardation, leading to LBW newborns
and that malarial preventive interventions in pregnant women are needed in
Tanzania.

BACKGROUND: Identification of children who need antimalarial treatment is
difficult in settings where confirmatory laboratory testing is not available, as 
in much of sub-Saharan Africa. The current national policy in Malawi is to treat 
all children with fever, usually defined as the mother's report of fever in the
child, for presumed malaria. To assess this policy and to find out whether a
better clinical case definition could be devised, we studied acutely ill children
presenting to two hospital outpatient departments in Malawi.
METHODS: The parent or guardian of each enrolled child (n = 1124) was asked a
standard series of questions about the symptoms and duration of the child's
illness. Each child was examined, axillary and rectal temperatures and blood
haemoglobin concentrations were measured, and a giemsastained thick smear was
examined for malaria parasites. Logistic regression procedures were used to
identify clinical predictors of parasitaemia.
FINDINGS: High temperature (37.7 degrees C or above), nailbed pallor, enlarged
spleen, and being seen at one of the clinics rather than the other were
associated with an increased risk of malaria parasitaemia in univariate analyses.
A revised malaria case definition of rectal temperature of 37.7 degrees C or
higher, splenomegaly, or nailbed pallor was 85% sensitive in identifying
parasitaemic children and 41% specific; the corresponding sensitivity and
specificity for the nationally recommended definition that equates mother's
history of fever with malaria were 93% and 21%. The revised case definition had
89% sensitivity in identifying parasitaemic children with haemoglobin
concentration below 80 g/L and 89% sensitivity in identifying children with
parasite density greater than 10,000/microL, characteristics that indicate a
clear need for antimalarial treatment.
INTERPRETATION: These results suggest that better clinical definitions are
feasible, that splenomegaly and pallor are helpful in identifying children with
malaria, and that much overtreatment of children without parasitaemia could be
avoided.

Clinical and parasitological studies on immunity to Plasmodium falciparum malaria
in children.

Høgh B(1).

Author information:

Malaria remains one of the major health problems in many tropical countries.
Plasmodium falciparum is the most common malaria parasite in Africa, and it
causes much more severe and progressive illness than any of the other types of
malaria parasite. Children living in sub-Saharan Africa are bearing the major
burden of the disease and the mortality. Whatever parameter is used to measure
the mortality or the morbidity from malaria, the true problem is likely to be
underestimated. The pattern of morbidity and mortality depends on the
transmission intensity; the more intensity of malaria transmission is increased, 
the earlier and more confined the age range of symptomatic malaria. The
asymptomatic carrier status is common, and 60-80% of the children in highly
endemic areas have P. falciparum parasitaemia at any given time. Consequently a
case definition based on the mere presence of parasites in the blood is
non-informative in terms of measuring morbidity. Recognizing that there are no
specific diagnostic clinical parameters for malaria, but that fever is very
common, and that morbidity is to some extent dependent on the parasite density,
we described using a logistic regression model the probability of being sick from
malaria in relation to body temperature and parasite density. Acquired clinical
and parasitological immunity develop progressively over several years after
repeated exposure to infection. Protection is acquired first against death or
severe clinical disease, then against milder clinical attacks, but protection
against infection is never complete. Clinical and parasitological immunity
develop concomitantly, as demonstrated by relating the parasite densities to
measured body temperature. However, the ability to control the disease and
parasite density develops earlier than the ability to prevent the parasite
infection. The individual immune mechanisms that are responsible for the acquired
immunity remain uncertain, but classical transfer experiments with polyvalent
gamma globulin from immune donors to non-immune individuals showed that
antibodies play an important role. Potential targets for malarial vaccines
include antigens on the surface of the sporozoites and the merozoites. Several
protein antigens from P. falciparum have been characterized at the molecular
level, and most of the characterized antigens have the common characteristic that
they are recognized by immune sera from individuals living in malaria endemic
areas. Working on the approach that potentially useful targets for protective
vaccine development can be identified by correlating the naturally acquired
immune responses with defined P. falciparum antigens, we examined antigens from
both the sporozoite stage (CS-protein) and the blood stages (Pf155/RESA, GLURP,
and MSP1), as well as P. falciparum induced neoantigens on the red blood cell
(band-3 neoantigens). The relationship between the immune response to these
defined P. falciparum antigens and clinical and parasitological protection was
analysed in the individual age groups. The contribution of the antigen-specific
immune response was evaluated, and a positive correlation of parasite density or 
probability of an episode of clinical malaria with antibody response to the
individual antigens was identified in defined age groups. This correlation,
however, did not span all age groups, and thus overall responses to defined
antigens are not considered to be reliable indicators of protection. The findings
may contribute to the understanding of immunological and clinical host responses 
to parasitaemia and to defined P. falciparum antigens. The studies on the impact 
of asexual stage infection and the human immune response led to studies on
specific and non-specific responses to P. falciparum blood-stage parasites and
observations on gametocytaemia. We demonstrated that pyrimethamine/sulfadoxine
and chloroquine did not induce gametocytogenesis as suggested previously, but
preformed gametocytes persisted after

Algorithms for verbal autopsies: a validation study in Kenyan children.

Author information: 
(1)Tropical Health Epidemiology Unit, London School of Hygiene and Tropical
Medicine, England.

The verbal autopsy (VA) questionnaire is a widely used method for collecting
information on cause-specific mortality where the medical certification of deaths
in childhood is incomplete. This paper discusses review by physicians and expert 
algorithms as approaches to ascribing cause of deaths from the VA questionnaire
and proposes an alternative, data-derived approach. In this validation study, the
relatives of 295 children who had died in hospital were interviewed using a VA
questionnaire. The children were assigned causes of death using data-derived
algorithms obtained under logistic regression and using expert algorithms. For
most causes of death, the data-derived algorithms and expert algorithms yielded
similar levels of diagnostic accuracy. However, a data-derived algorithm for
malaria gave a sensitivity of 71% (95% Cl: 58-84%), which was significantly
higher than the sensitivity of 47% obtained under an expert algorithm. The need
for exploring this and other ways in which the VA technique can be improved are
discussed. The implications of less-than-perfect sensitivity and specificity are 
explored using numerical examples. Misclassification bias should be taken into
consideration when planning and evaluating epidemiological studies.

Malaria during pregnancy may result in fetal exposure to malaria when parasites
are transmitted across the placenta. To document the rate of transplacental
passage of Plasmodium falciparum and to identify the risk factors for
congenitally acquired malaria infection, we examined umbilical cord blood for
malaria parasites from 2,080 newborn infants born to mothers enrolled in a study 
of malaria prophylaxis during pregnancy. Cord blood parasitemia was detected in
140 (6.7%) newborn infants with a geometric mean density of 187
parasites/microliter (range 12-99, 752 parasites/microliter). The likelihood of
umbilical cord blood parasitemia was closely linked to the parasite density of
placental malaria infection and the density of maternal peripheral blood
parasitemia at the time of delivery; all babies born to women with both placental
and peripheral blood parasitemia densities > or = 10,000/microliter had cord
blood parasitemia. In a multivariate logistic regression model, male sex,
premature delivery, and placental and maternal peripheral blood malaria
parasitemia were independently associated with a baby being born with umbilical
cord blood parasitemia. In this setting, highly endemic for malaria,
transplacental transmission of malaria from infected placentae occurs frequently 
and is directly related to the density of maternal malaria infection.

The factors which identify patients at risk of treatment failure were
characterized in 1590 children and adults with uncomplicated falciparum malaria
treated with 15 or 25 mg/kg of mefloquine on the borders of Thailand. Six
independent predictors of failure were identified using multiple logistic
regression. Age < or = 2 years (odds ratio [OR] 4.54), 3-15 years (OR 4.4),
vomiting < 30 min after a single dose of 25 mg/kg (despite re-administration of
the dose) (OR 2.5) and diarrhoea after treatment (OR 3.6) were the strongest
predictors of failure by day 7. Parasitaemias > 10 000/mm3 (OR 1.4), and fever
with a history of recent vomiting (OR 1.6) were risk factors for recrudescence of
the infection between days 10 and 28. Patients treated with mefloquine in the
previous 2 months were also at increased risk of failure (OR 2.38), particularly 
if they were anaemic (haematocrit < 30%) (OR 5.96), which suggested that they had
recrudescent infections at presentation. Combined, these 6 factors identified
half of all treatment failures. Vomiting and diarrhoea accounted for 24% of the
early failures in children. Patients at increased risk of treatment failure
should be monitored closely and given early alternative treatment if fever and
parasites persist for > or = 3 d.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze primary health care service (PHCS) utilization by febrile
patients in a malarial area of Mexico.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out in September, 1993,
in 32 communities of Tabasco (decentralized health services) and Campeche
(non-decentralized) states. Predictors of utilization were analyzed using
descriptive statistics and logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: 817 febrile patients received care at home 55% of all febrile patients
received care at home (SELF), 16.5% by PHCS and 17% by volunteer collaborators,
with no significant differences in health services utilization between states.
Febrile patients living in communities where PHCS was available used these
facilities 11 times more than those without PHCS (C.I. 95%: 7.0-18.2%). Severely 
febrile patients used PHCS 2.8 times more than mild-moderate cases (C.I. 95%:
1.7-4.6%). Febrile patients under 13 years of age used PHCS 1.9 times more than
older patients. Two per cent of febrile patients consisted of malaria cases.
CONCLUSIONS: There was no difference between decentralized and non-decentralized 
health services regarding the utilization of PHCS. Fever symptoms must be
evaluated as a single screening indicator of malarial disease.

The clinical and laboratory features of severe falciparum malaria in 180 Gambian 
children were studied between 1985 and 1989. Of the 180 children, 118 (66%)
presented with seizures, 77 (43%) had cerebral malaria, 35 (20%) had witnessed
seizures after admission, 29 (16%) were hypoglycemic, and 27 (15%) died.
Respiratory distress was a common harbinger of a fatal outcome. The differences
in admission parasite counts in the blood, hematocrit, and opening cerebrospinal 
pressures for patients who died and survivors were not significant. A multiple
logistic regression model identified neurological status (coma, particularly if
associated with extensor posturing), stage of parasite development on the
peripheral blood film, pulse rate of > 150 or respiratory rate of > 50,
hypoglycemia, and hyperlactatemia (plasma lactate level, > 5 mmol/L) as
independent indicators of a fatal outcome. Biochemical evidence of hepatic and
renal dysfunction was an additional marker of a poor prognosis, but, in contrast 
to severe malaria in adults, none of these children with severe malaria had acute
renal failure.

Malaria mortality and morbidity were studied in a rural population of 4000 in the
Wosera area, East Sepik Province, Papua New Guinea. Malaria accounted for 4.9% of
the 162 deaths investigated by verbal autopsy and for 12.2% of the 49 deaths
assessed through medical records. Malaria was the first cause of death in
children aged 0.5-4 years. Of the 7795 subjects interviewed and bled during six
cross-sectional community-based surveys, children of 1-4 years had the highest
malaria-related morbidity. In this age group, point prevalences of fever, fever
associated with parasitaemia, and fever plus Plasmodium falciparum (Pf)
parasitaemia > or = 10,000 parasites/microliters blood were 5%, 4.1% and 1.5%,
respectively. The corresponding figures for adults were 2%, 0.9% and 0.1%,
respectively. The calculation of attributable fraction (AF) using a multiple
logistic regression model showed that malaria accounted for 0.44 of all fevers in
children of 1-4 years and 0.08 of the fevers in adults. Prevalence data derived
from the AF estimate were compared with those calculated using different accepted
density thresholds. The prevalences which best approximated the results from the 
logistic regression model were obtained using parasitaemia cut-offs of > or =
1000 Pf parasites/microliter in children aged 1-4 years and adults older than 19 
years and of > or = 10,000 parasites/microliter in those aged 5-19 years.
Prevalence of fever associated with parasitaemia was highly seasonal, with a peak
at the beginning of the wet season. The geographical distribution of malaria
morbidity was not uniform. The measurement of malaria-related morbidity, the
identification of significant seasonal and local variation as well as the
assessment of different methods of defining a clinical episode of Pf malaria are 
crucial for the design and evaluation of intervention studies, including field
trials of antimalarial vaccines.

The kinetics of Plasmodium berghei infection and the development of lactic
acidosis, hypoglycemia, and anemia were defined in young Wistar rats. This model 
of metabolic dysfunction, which is similar to that of severe human malaria, was
used to test the hypothesis that dichloroacetate, a treatment for lactic
acidosis, prolonged survival in rats receiving a single antimalarial dose of
quinine (20 mg/kg). Rats with hyperlactatemia (lactate > 5 mmol/liter, N = 183)
were randomized to receive either dichloroacetate (100 mg/kg, N = 99) or saline
(N = 84) and were monitored for outcome (survival or death) for 50 hr. Logistic
regression modeling adjusting for baseline venous lactate concentration
demonstrated that dichloroacetate increases survival rates in rats with venous
lactate concentrations between 5 and 8.9 mmol/liter (odds ratio > 2.2, P <
0.021). This is the first demonstration that specific intervention to treat
lactic acidosis can prolong survival and suggests that dichloroacetate may be
useful as adjunctive therapy in the management of lactic acidosis complicating
severe falciparum malaria.

BACKGROUND: About 90 percent of the deaths from malaria are in African children, 
but criteria to guide the recognition and management of severe malaria have not
been validated in them.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective study of all children admitted to the
pediatric ward of a Kenyan district hospital with a primary diagnosis of malaria.
We calculated the frequency and mortality rate for each of the clinical and
laboratory criteria in the current World Health Organization (WHO) definition of 
severe malaria, and then used logistic-regression analysis to identify the
variables with the greatest prognostic value.
RESULTS: We studied 1844 children (mean age, 26.4 months) with a primary
diagnosis of malaria. Not included were 18 children who died on arrival and 4 who
died of other causes. The mortality rate was 3.5 percent (95 percent confidence
interval, 2.7 to 4.3 percent), and 84 percent of the deaths occurred within 24
hours of admission. Logistic-regression analysis identified four key prognostic
indicators: impaired consciousness (relative risk, 3.3; 95 percent confidence
interval, 1.6 to 7.0), respiratory distress (relative risk, 3.9; 95 percent
confidence interval, 2.0 to 7.7), hypoglycemia (relative risk, 3.3; 95 percent
confidence interval, 1.6 to 6.7), and jaundice (relative risk, 2.6; 95 percent
confidence interval, 1.1 to 6.3). Of the 64 children who died, 54 were among
those with impaired consciousness (n = 336; case fatality rate, 11.9 percent) or 
respiratory distress (n = 251; case fatality rate, 13.9 percent), or both. Hence,
this simple bedside index identified 84.4 percent of the fatal cases, as compared
with the 79.7 percent identified by the current WHO criteria.
CONCLUSIONS: In African children with malaria, the presence of impaired
consciousness or respiratory distress can identify those at high risk for death.

PIP: Approximately 90% of mortality due to malaria is in African children, but
criteria to guide the recognition and management of severe malaria have not been 
validated in them. Findings are presented from a prospective study of all
children admitted to the pediatric ward of a Kenyan district hospital with a
primary diagnosis of malaria. The authors calculated the frequency and mortality 
rate for each of the clinical and laboratory criteria in the World Health
Organization (WHO) definition of severe malaria, and then used
logistic-regression analysis to identify the variables with the greatest
prognostic value. 1844 children of mean age 26.4 months were seen. Not included
were 18 children who died on admission and 4 who died of other causes. The
mortality rate was 3.5% and 84% of the deaths occurred within 24 hours of
admission. Impaired consciousness carried a relative risk of 3.3; respiratory
distress, 3.9; hypoglycemia, 3.3; and jaundice, 2.6. 54 of the 64 children who
died had impaired consciousness, respiratory distress, or both. This bedside
index thus identified 84.4% of the fatal cases compared to only 79.7% identified 
by current WHO criteria. The presence of impaired consciousness or respiratory
distress can therefore identify which African children with malaria are at high
risk of dying.

A total of 736 outpatients diagnosed as having malaria using clinical criteria at
a health centre in a highly endemic area of Papua New Guinea were investigated
parasitologically. Plasmodium falciparum-attributable fractions were determined
using a logistic regression model to compare parasite densities in cases with
those of healthy individuals in community surveys. Thirty-seven percent of
presumptive cases were found to have raised P. falciparum parasitaemia. This
corresponds to an average reporting rate for the population of 0.53 attributable 
episodes per annum. Whilst the maximum prevalence of parasitaemia in the
community was in children aged 5-9 years, the maximum age-specific incidence of
attributable cases at the outpatient clinic was 2 cases per annum in the 2- to
4-year-old age group. The procedure for estimating attributable fractions makes
it possible to compare morbidity rates between age groups, and to examine how the
relationship between morbidity risk and parasite density changes with age,
without diagnosing individual episodes. The average tolerance of parasites in an 
age group was measured by considering the level of parasitaemia associated with a
given risk of malaria-attributable morbidity. In contrast to anti-parasite
immunity, tolerance of parasites declines with age since at parasite isodensity
the probability of being symptomatic increases with age.

Attributable fraction estimates and case definitions for malaria in endemic
areas.

Smith T(1), Schellenberg JA, Hayes R.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Public Health and Epidemiology, Swiss Tropical Institute, Basel.

Asymptomatic carriage of malaria parasites occurs frequently in endemic areas and
the detection of parasites in a blood film from a febrile individual does not
necessarily indicate clinical malaria. In areas of low and moderate endemicity
the parasite prevalence in fever cases can be compared with that in community
controls to estimate the fraction of cases which are attributable to malaria. In 
areas of very high transmission such estimates of the attributable fraction may
be imprecise because very few individuals are without parasites. Furthermore,
non-malarial fevers appear to suppress low levels of parasitaemia resulting in
biased estimates of the attributable fraction. Alternative estimation techniques 
were therefore explored using data collected during 1989-1991 from a highly
endemic area of Tanzania, where over 80 per cent of young children are
parasitaemic. Logistic regression methods which model fever risk as a continuous 
function of parasite density give more precise estimates than simple analyses of 
parasite prevalence and overcome problems of bias caused by the effects of
non-malarial fevers. Such models can be used to estimate the probability that any
individual episode is malaria-attributable and can be extended to allow for
covariates. A case definition for symptomatic malaria that is used widely in
endemic areas requires fever together with a parasite density above a specific
cutoff. The choice of a cutoff value can be assisted by using the probabilities
derived from the logistic model to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of
the case definition.

Severe anaemia in pregnancy is a major obstetric problem in malaria-endemic
areas. This study reports a cross-sectional investigation of malaria infection
and haematological values at delivery in 440 women from urban Zanzibar. Severe
anaemia [with haemoglobin (Hb) < or = 7 g/dl] was identified in 36 women (9.3%)
and mild anaemia (7 < Hb < 10 g/dl) in 269 (69.7%) while 81 women (21.0%) had
normal Hb values. Malaria infection was diagnosed in 187/385 women (48.6%) on the
basis of either peripheral blood examination or placental histology. Univariate
analysis indicated that the proportion of women with anaemia was similar in those
with (85%) and without (80%) malaria infection. However, when primigravidae were 
considered alone, malaria infection was significantly more frequent among anaemic
women (65.2%) than in those with normal Hb values (40.0%). In the logistic
regression analysis, including age, parity, education level, malaria and free
serum iron as independent variables and anaemia (Hb < or = 10 g/dl) as response
variable, the odds ratio (OR) for malaria infection was 1.2 (P > 0.1). However, a
similar analysis indicated that malaria was significantly associated with anaemia
in the primigravidae, with an OR of 3.2 (95% confidence interval: 1.1-9.6; P <
0.05). In conclusion, this cross-sectional investigation indicated that malaria
plays a significant role in the determination of anaemia in primigravidae, but
not in multiparae, in the urban study area.

Malaria: how useful are clinical criteria for improving the diagnosis in a highly
endemic area?

Author information: 
(1)Papua New Guinea Institute of Medical Research, Madang.

To assess the validity of clinical criteria, we investigated 2096 outpatients
diagnosed as malaria cases by nurses at a rural health subcentre in a highly
endemic area of Papua New Guinea. 73% of the children < 10 years old had a
positive blood slide for any species of Plasmodium and 32% had > or = 10,000 P.
falciparum parasites per microL. For adults the frequencies were 51% and 9%,
respectively. Stepwise logistic regression identified spleen size, no cough,
temperature, no chest indrawing, and normal stools as significant predictors for 
a positive blood slide in children; no cough and normal stools predicted a
positive blood slide in adults. Fever, no cough, vomiting, and enlarged spleen
were significant predictors for a P. falciparum parasitaemia > or = 10,000/microL
in children; in adults the only predictor was vomiting. In children the
association of no cough and enlarged spleen had the best predictive value for a
positive blood slide, and a temperature > or = 38 degrees C had the best
predictive value for a P. falciparum parasitaemia > or = 10,000 microL. In
adults, no major symptom had a good predictive value for a positive blood slide
but vomiting had the best predictive value for a P. falciparum parasitaemia > or 
= 10,000/microL. When microscopy is not available, these findings can help in
areas of high endemicity to determine which patients with a history of fever are 
most likely to have malaria and, more importantly, for which patients another
diagnosis should be strongly considered.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Community Medicine, College of Medicine, University of Juba,
Sudan.

OBJECTIVES: To determine levels and risk factors for perinatal mortality in
Central Sudan.
METHODS: Hospital and community based studies were conducted during the period
1989-1990. Of 5328 births registered in the hospital, 197 stillborns and 812
live-born infants were included in a nested case-control study. In the community,
a follow-up study was conducted on 1592 midwife-assisted home deliveries.
Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors of
perinatal mortality and adjusted population attributable risks were estimated to 
assess the contribution of each factor.
RESULTS: The perinatal mortality rate was 85.4/1000 births in the hospital
population and 29.4/1000 births in the community population. The major risk
factors for perinatal mortality in the hospital and the community studies were
similar and modifiable.
CONCLUSIONS: To lower perinatal mortality, improvements in maternal nutrition,
malaria treatment and control, avoidance of agricultural pesticides during
pregnancy, and adequate antenatal and intrapartum care are recommended.

To investigate behaviour in the use of drug prophylaxis against malaria and the
risk factors for non-compliance, 507 European or North American travelers
returning from endemic areas were studied retrospectively at Berlin in a 11-year 
period from 1980 to 1990. Compliance was significantly correlated with shorter
travel duration: the group with good compliance stayed 37.2 +/- 38.5 days (mean
+/- SD) in contrast to 69.8 +/- 93.5 days in the group of patients with no
compliance (p = 0.00001). Older patients were significantly more compliant than
patients aged < 55 years (20/27 compliant at > 54 years vs. 175/476 at < 55
years; p = 0.0001). Compliance was significantly affected by travel destination
(Southern and East African regions; p = 0.0054), age (< or = 15 and > or = 55
years, respectively; p = 0.0001), and reason of travel (package tours; p =
0.0001). CART analysis confirmed logistic regression analysis with respect to age
and travel type, and revealed that patients using only one information source
were significantly more compliant than those using two or more information
sources. Travel agencies were nearly as well informed as Institutes of Tropical
Medicine, but family doctors had a significant incidence of giving wrong advice. 
This study should enable medical personnel dealing with prophylactic advice
against malaria to identify patients at high risk for non-compliance, and to
educate them more carefully than other travellers regarding antimalarial drug
prophylaxis.

The environmental and socioeconomic risk factors for preterm delivery were
assessed in a West African urban population (Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso). The
study population were 102 cases of preterm delivery matched with 102 controls
obtained from 4124 sequential deliveries which occurred between May and October
1989 in the three maternity centres in the city. The univariate analysis
identified the risk factors as age (< 20 years), primiparity, marital status
(single), low frequency of antenatal visits, death of a previous child and level 
of education of the mother. The following risk factors identified by multivariate
analysis (logistic regression) are consistent with those identified in previous
studies: youth of the mother, primiparity (P = 0.01) and death of a previous
child (P < 0.05). On the other hand, in this study, the level of education of the
parent was identified as an independent risk factor (P < 0.001). This finding
could be used to determine a target population for prevention programmes.

PIP: Between May and October 1989 in Burkina Faso, a pediatrician daily visited
the clinic at the maternity hospital, the Farakan maternity clinic, and the
Guimbi maternity clinic (the only 3 maternity clinics) in Bobo-Dioulasso to
confirm the diagnosis of preterm delivery (gestational age 28-37 weeks) and to
collect data on 102 deliveries and on 102 full-term deliveries occurring at the
same time. The physician and epidemiologists conducted perhaps the first case
control study of preterm delivery risk factors in West Africa. The incidence of
preterm deliveries was 2.6%. The univariate analysis identified the following to 
be risk factors of prematurity: being 20 years old (odds ratio [OR] = 6.9 for
15-19 year olds vs. older women; p .01), primiparity (OR = 2.88; p = .03), being 
single (OR = 3.44; p .01), having less than 3 prenatal care visits (OR = 7.9; p
.001), death of a previous child (OR = 3.1; p .01), and malaria prophylaxis (OR =
1.7; p = .05). Absence of schooling of parents appeared to be a protective factor
(OR = .47; p .001). The multivariate analysis uncovered 3 significant risk
factors of prematurity: young mother and primiparity (OR = 4.4; p = .01), less
than 3 prenatal visits (OR = 9.3; p .001), and death of a previous child (OR =
2.2; p .05). Lack of schooling continued to have a protective effect when
researchers adjusted for other variables (OR = .37; p .001). As a possible
explanation for education being a risk factor of prematurity in Burkina Faso, the
researchers suggested that educated parents are more likely to use motorized
transport on bumpy roads for 6-7 hours at a time which caused intrauterine
vibrations, resulting in preterm delivery. In developed countries, education
reduces the risk of preterm delivery.

Antimalarial drug utilization by women in Ethiopia: a
knowledge-attitudes-practice study.

Quebec, Canada.

A survey was undertaken between December 1991 and February 1992 to assess the
knowledge, attitudes, and practices with respect to malaria of 300 women from six
randomly selected rural communities in central Ethiopia. A total of 85% were able
to recognize one or more of the common symptoms of the disease; however, the
modes of transmission were generally misunderstood and only 23% believed that
transmission could be prevented. More women preferred to obtain antimalarials
from government clinics rather than from private drug shops, mission clinics,
unofficial suppliers of injections, open markets, or from leftover sources.
Under-5-year-olds were identified as the most malaria-vulnerable group and given 
priority for treatment; severity of illness was the principal determinant in
seeking treatment. Decisions about treatment were generally made jointly by both 
parents. Knowledge about the transmissibility of malaria decreased with
increasing distance from a health unit (odds ratio: 0.48; 95% confidence
interval: 0.27, 0.86). A logistic regression analysis indicated that literacy and
village were the most important variables associated with knowledge about
preventing malaria.

PIP: Malaria is the most important cause of fever and morbidity in the tropics
and is a significant source of mortality, especially among infants and young
children. It remains one of the top ten leading causes of morbidity and mortality
in Ethiopia. The resistance of the anopheline mosquito vectors and of the
Plasmodium falciparum parasites is the major obstacle to the control of malaria. 
Preventing the foci of resistant falciparum malaria from widening requires the
rational use of antimalarials and the intensification of vector control. The use 
and misuse of antimalarial drugs has, however, been largely neglected. The
authors conducted a survey between December 1991 and February 1992 to assess the 
knowledge, attitudes, and practices with respect to malaria of 300 women from six
randomly selected rural communities in central Ethiopia. Most participants were
aged 30-44 years in the range of 17-60, and 90.3% were married. 98% of the
spouses were farmers and only 16.7% of the women could read or write. 85% were
able to recognize one or more of the common symptoms of malaria, but the modes of
transmission were generally misunderstood and only 23% believed that transmission
could be prevented. More women preferred to obtain antimalarials from government 
clinics instead of from private drug shops, mission clinics, unofficial suppliers
of injections, open markets, or from leftover sources. The women identified
under-five year olds as the group most vulnerable to malaria and gave them
priority treatment. Severity of illness was the principal determinant in seeking 
treatment, with decisions about treatment generally made jointly by both parents.
Knowledge about the transmissibility of malaria decreased with increasing
distance from a health unit, while literacy and village were the most important
variables associated with knowledge about preventing malaria.

Some determinants of nutritional status of one- to four-year-old children in low 
income urban areas in Tanzania.

Some socio-economic and demographic factors contributing to nutritional status
(underweight and wasting) of children aged 1 to 4 years (n = 949) were studied in
selected low income urban areas in Tanzania. Children were classified as either
normal or malnourished and logistic regression was used in the analysis. Of the
demographic variables studied, sex of the child was significant using both
weight-for-age and weight-for-height indices. Males had better nutritional status
than females. Mother's education level and age were significant risk factors
using weight-for-age. Immunization status of the child and household density were
also significant, but their effects became insignificant when morbidity and
dietary variables were included in the analysis. Using weight-for-height the
place of residence and number of children under 5 years in a household had
significant effects on nutritional status through the latter was less significant
when morbidity variables were incorporated. Children from big towns were
significantly better off nutritionally than those from small towns. For dietary
and morbidity variables frequency of feeding and diarrhoea were significant
predictors of nutritional status (weight-for-age) while malaria was a significant
predictor of weight-for-height.

Field surveys of mosquito breeding sites on the Pacific coastal plain and
foothill regions of southern Chiapas, Mexico, were carried out in the dry and wet
seasons of 1988. At each site, selected environmental variables were measured or 
estimated, presence and percent cover of aquatic plants recorded, a water sample 
collected for subsequent analyses, and 10-30 dips made for mosquito larvae.
Logistic regression and discriminant analyses revealed that the occurrence of
Anopheles albimanus larvae in both the wet and dry seasons was positively
associated with planktonic algae and negatively associated with altitude. In the 
dry season, An. albimanus larvae were largely restricted to the margins of
permanent water bodies and were associated with the presence of floating plants, 
particularly Eichhornia crassipes. During the wet season An. albimanus larvae
were positively associated with emergent plants, particularly seasonally flooded 
Cyperaceae, and phosphorus (PO4) concentrations, and were negatively associated
with abundant filamentous algae, high levels of total suspended solids (TSS) and 
Salvinia. In the dry season, An. pseudopunctipennis larvae were positively
associated with filamentous algae, altitude and the presence of Heteranthera if
encountered in a riverine setting, and were negatively associated with water
depth. During the wet season, flooding eliminated typical flood plain An.
pseudopunctipennis habitats, and larvae were rarely encountered.

Multiple risk factors of nasopharyngeal carcinoma: Epstein-Barr virus, malarial
infection, cigarette smoking and familial tendency.

A community-based case-control study was carried out to assess multiple risk
factors and familial aggregation of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). All of the
347 pathologically-confirmed NPC new cases were serially recruited from the
National Taiwan University Hospital, and healthy community controls one-to-one
matched with cases on age, sex and residence were selected from household
registration offices. NPC risk factors were obtained from the study subjects
through standardized interviews according to a structured questionnaire. Levels
of antibody to EBV-specific DNase (anti-EBV DNase) and IgA antibody to EBV viral 
capsid antigen (anti-EBV VCA) were determined by standard methods blindly.
Multiple logistic regression analysis for matched data showed significant
associations of NPC with high levels of anti-EBV DNase and anti-EBV VCA
independently. The effect of cigarette smoking on NPC was modified by age. The
older the age, the more striking the dose-response relation between cigarette
smoking and NPC. There was no significant association between alcohol consumption
and NPC. Malarial infection history was associated with NPC with an odds ratio of
2.2, but the association was significant in males only. First-degree relatives of
NPC cases had a greater NPC-affected rate than those of matched healthy controls 
with a relative risk of 19.2, and the heritability of NPC was estimated as 0.60
(95% confidence interval = 0.55-0.64) based on the multifactorial inheritance
model. Familial NPC cases were younger than sporadic cases, but environmental
risk factors were similar in the two groups.

Parasites and showy males: malarial infection and color variation in fence
lizards.

Ressel S(1), Schall JJ(1).

Author information: 
(1)Department of Zoology, University of Vermont, 05405, Burlington, VT, USA.

Hamilton and Zuk (1982) proposed that the quality of male showy traits reflects
genetically-based resistance to parasites and can be used by females to select
mates that are less prone to parasitic attack. The hypothesis requires that a
particular state of a variable showy trait should be associated with parasite
infection. We tested this idea with a population of western fence lizards,
Sceloporus occidentalis, infected with the malarial parasite, Plasmodium
mexicanum. Ventral color pattern is strongly dimorphic in fence lizards and
varies greatly among males in this population. Malaria-infected males exhibited
significantly more black and less pale on their ventral surface than did
noninfected males of similar body size. This difference was not a function of
differing ages of infected and noninfected animals of the same body size.
However, logistic regression demonstrated that females using male ventral color
as a gauge of infection status would only marginally improve their chance of
choosing a noninfected lizard over random selection of mates.

A hospital-based case-control study was conducted at Paholpolpayuhasena Hospital,
Kanchanaburi, Thailand to investigate social and behavioural factors believed to 
be associated with malaria occurrence. Data were obtained from 210 malaria and
210 non-malaria patients presenting at the hospital from August to September
1984. All study subjects were interviewed by trained interviewers using a
structured interview form. The results showed that the malaria cases were
predominantly male, under age 30 and single. Bivariate analysis showed a
significant association for knowledge of transmission, use of mosquito nets, and 
residing or working in forested areas 2 weeks before the illness with malaria
occurrence. Logistic regression analysis revealed that age, education, duration
of stay in the area and knowledge of transmission were significantly associated
with disease occurrence. After adjusting for these variables, use of a mosquito
net was also found to be significantly associated with occurrence. Residence or
work place 2 weeks before the illness was another variable significantly
associated with the presence of malaria infection even after adjustment for age
and knowledge of transmission. The groups found in this study to be at high risk 
of malaria infection were younger age groups, forest-related workers and migrant 
workers. The results of this study suggest that efforts should be made to
identify these people and target them for malaria health education.
