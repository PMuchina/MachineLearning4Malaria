BACKGROUND: Microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained blood films remains a major
form of diagnosis in malaria case management, and is a reference standard for
research. However, as with other visualization-based diagnoses, accuracy depends 
on individual technician performance, making standardization difficult and
reliability poor. Automated image recognition based on machine-learning,
utilizing convolutional neural networks, offers potential to overcome these
drawbacks. A prototype digital microscope device employing an algorithm based on 
machine-learning, the Autoscope, was assessed for its potential in malaria
microscopy. Autoscope was tested in the Iquitos region of Peru in 2016 at two
peripheral health facilities, with routine microscopy and PCR as reference
standards. The main outcome measures include sensitivity and specificity of
diagnosis of malaria from Giemsa-stained blood films, using PCR as reference.
METHODS: A cross-sectional, observational trial was conducted at two peripheral
primary health facilities in Peru. 700 participants were enrolled with the
criteria: (1) age between 5 and 75 years, (2) history of fever in the last 3 days
or elevated temperature on admission, (3) informed consent. The main outcome
measures included sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis of malaria from
Giemsa-stained blood films, using PCR as reference.
RESULTS: At the San Juan clinic, sensitivity of Autoscope for diagnosing malaria 
was 72% (95% CI 64-80%), and specificity was 85% (95% CI 79-90%). Microscopy
performance was similar to Autoscope, with sensitivity 68% (95% CI 59-76%) and
specificity 100% (95% CI 98-100%). At San Juan, 85% of prepared slides had a
minimum of 600 WBCs imaged, thus meeting Autoscope's design assumptions. At the
second clinic, Santa Clara, the sensitivity of Autoscope was 52% (95% CI 44-60%) 
and specificity was 70% (95% CI 64-76%). Microscopy performance at Santa Clara
was 42% (95% CI 34-51) and specificity was 97% (95% CI 94-99). Only 39% of slides
from Santa Clara met Autoscope's design assumptions regarding WBCs imaged.
CONCLUSIONS: Autoscope's diagnostic performance was on par with routine
microscopy when slides had adequate blood volume to meet its design assumptions, 
as represented by results from the San Juan clinic. Autoscope's diagnostic
performance was poorer than routine microscopy on slides from the Santa Clara
clinic, which generated slides with lower blood volumes. Results of the study
reflect both the potential for artificial intelligence to perform tasks currently
conducted by highly-trained experts, and the challenges of replicating the
adaptiveness of human thought processes.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become the architecture of choice for
visual recognition tasks. However, these models are perceived as black boxes
since there is a lack of understanding of the learned behavior from the
underlying task of interest. This lack of transparency is a serious drawback,
particularly in applications involving medical screening and diagnosis since
poorly understood model behavior could adversely impact subsequent clinical
decision-making. Recently, researchers have begun working on this issue and
several methods have been proposed to visualize and understand the behavior of
these models. We highlight the advantages offered through visualizing and
understanding the weights, saliencies, class activation maps, and region of
interest localizations in customized CNNs applied to the challenge of classifying
parasitized and uninfected cells to aid in malaria screening. We provide an
explanation for the models' classification decisions. We characterize, evaluate, 
and statistically validate the performance of different customized CNNs keeping
every training subject's data separate from the validation set.

Malaria is a blood disease caused by the Plasmodium parasites transmitted through
the bite of female Anopheles mosquito. Microscopists commonly examine thick and
thin blood smears to diagnose disease and compute parasitemia. However, their
accuracy depends on smear quality and expertise in classifying and counting
parasitized and uninfected cells. Such an examination could be arduous for
large-scale diagnoses resulting in poor quality. State-of-the-art image-analysis 
based computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) methods using machine learning (ML)
techniques, applied to microscopic images of the smears using hand-engineered
features demand expertise in analyzing morphological, textural, and positional
variations of the region of interest (ROI). In contrast, Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNN), a class of deep learning (DL) models promise highly scalable and 
superior results with end-to-end feature extraction and classification. Automated
malaria screening using DL techniques could, therefore, serve as an effective
diagnostic aid. In this study, we evaluate the performance of pre-trained CNN
based DL models as feature extractors toward classifying parasitized and
uninfected cells to aid in improved disease screening. We experimentally
determine the optimal model layers for feature extraction from the underlying
data. Statistical validation of the results demonstrates the use of pre-trained
CNNs as a promising tool for feature extraction for this purpose.
