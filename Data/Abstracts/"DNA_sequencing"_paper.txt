BACKGROUND: Anopheles sinensis is the primary vector of vivax malaria in China
and its control is under great threat as the development of insecticide
resistance. In contrast to physiological resistance, there is no report of
behavioural modifications of resistant An. sinensis after long-term insecticide
use, despite their huge potential impact on malaria transmission.
METHODS: Larvae or pupae of An. sinensis were collected from Yuanyang, Bishan,
and Wuhe counties from southwestern to eastern China. Resistance to deltamethrin 
was assayed using the standard World Health Organization (WHO) susceptibility
test. The frequency distribution of the kdr allele of the para-type sodium
channel gene was determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and 
DNA sequencing. Contact repellency to deltamethrin-impregnated bed nets was
evaluated using a modified WHO cone bioassay.
RESULTS: All contemporary field populations for all three geographic locations
were resistant to deltamethrin, with mortality ranging from 6.00 to 26.79%. Three
kdr genotypes with either an L1014F or L1014C substitution with frequencies of
76.10-100% were identified in the Bishan and Wuhe populations, but no kdr
mutations were detected in the Yuanyang samples despite high phenotypic
resistance. The susceptible mosquitoes exhibited significantly longer flying time
and more takeoffs on deltamethrin-treated bed nets (DTN) than on untreated bed
nets (UTN), suggestive of robust avoidance behaviour. However, no significant
increases in the frequency of takeoffs or flying time were observed in
deltamethrin-resistant An. sinensis populations when exposed on DTNs, regardless 
of the presence of a kdr mutation. Moreover, the first takeoff from DTNs by
resistant mosquitoes significantly lagged behind compared to susceptible
mosquitoes.
CONCLUSION: The An. sinensis populations were highly resistant to deltamethrin
and exhibited decreased avoidance behaviour. Behavioural modification
significantly associated with deltamethrin resistance, but not directly related
to the presence of kdr mutations, indicating that there are additional factors
contributing to the changes.

Cyclospora cayetanensis is a human parasite transmitted via ingestion of
contaminated food or water. Cases of C. cayetanensis infection acquired in the
United States often go unexplained, partly because of the difficulties associated
with epidemiologic investigations of such cases and the lack of genotyping
methods. A Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) method for C. cayetanensis based on 
five microsatellite loci amplified by nested PCR was described in 2016. The MLST 
loci had high variability, but many specimens could not be assigned a type
because of poor DNA sequencing quality at one or more loci. We analyzed
Cyclospora-positive stool specimens collected during 1997-2016 from 54 patients, 
including 51 from the United States. We noted limited inter-specimen variability 
for one locus (CYC15) and the frequent occurrence of unreadable DNA sequences for
two loci (CYC3 and CYC13). Overall, using the remaining two loci (CYC21 and
CYC22), we detected 17 different concatenated sequence types. For four of five
clusters of epidemiologically linked cases for which we had specimens from >1
case-patient, the specimens associated with the same cluster had the same type.
However, we also noted the same type for specimens that were geographically and
temporally unrelated, indicating poor discriminatory power. Furthermore, many
specimens had what appeared to be a mixture of sequence types at locus CYC22. We 
conclude that it may be difficult to substantially improve the performance of the
MLST method because of the nucleotide repeat features of the markers, along with 
the frequent occurrence of mixed genotypes in Cyclospora infections.

Amoebic trophozoites were identified in the cervicovaginal smear of a U.S.
patient without travel history at the time of intrauterine device (IUD) removal. 
Subsequent morphologic analysis and DNA sequencing identified a mixed
cervicovaginal colonization of the female genital tract with both Entamoeba
gingivalis and Entamoeba polecki in association with Actinomyces species
bacteria. This highlights to the potential for colonization of the genital tract 
with E. gingivalis, particularly in association with IUD placement, and
represents the first report of E. polecki in this context.

BACKGROUND: Malaria in Nigeria is principally due to Plasmodium falciparum and,
to a lesser extent to Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium ovale. Plasmodium vivax 
is thought to be absent in Nigeria in particular and sub-Saharan Africa in
general, due to the near fixation of the Duffy negative gene in this population. 
Nevertheless, there are frequent reports of P. vivax infection in Duffy negative 
individuals in the sub-region, including reports from two countries sharing
border with Nigeria to the west (Republic of Benin) and east (Cameroon).
Additionally, there were two cases of microscopic vivax-like malaria from
Nigerian indigenous population. Hence molecular surveillance of the circulating
Plasmodium species in two states (Lagos and Edo) of southwestern Nigeria was
carried out.
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey between September 2016 and March 2017 was
conducted. 436 febrile patients were included for the present work. Venous blood 
of these patients was subjected to RDT as well as microscopy. Further, parasite
DNA was isolated from positive samples and PCR diagnostic was employed followed
by direct sequencing of the 18S rRNA of Plasmodium species as well as sequencing 
of a portion of the promoter region of the Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines.
Samples positive for P. vivax were re-amplified several times and finally using
the High Fidelity Taq to rule out any bias introduced.
RESULTS: Of the 256 (58.7%) amplifiable malaria parasite DNA, P. falciparum was, 
as expected, the major cause of infection, either alone 85.5% (219/256; 97 from
Edo and 122 from Lagos), or mixed with P. malariae 6.3% (16/256) or with P. vivax
1.6% (4/256). Only one of the five P. vivax isolates was found to be a single
infection. DNA sequencing and subsequent alignment of the 18S rRNA of P. vivax
with the reference strains displayed very high similarities (100%). Remarkably,
the T-33C was identified in all P. vivax samples, thus confirming that all
vivax-infected patients in the current study are Duffy negative.
CONCLUSION: The present study gave the first molecular evidence of P. vivax in
Nigeria in Duffy negative individuals. Though restricted to two states; Edo in
South-South and Lagos in South-west Nigeria, the real burden of this species in
Nigeria and sub-Saharan Africa might have been underestimated, hence there is
need to put in place a country-wide, as well as a sub-Saharan Africa-wide
surveillance and appropriate control measures.

Evolution and spread of malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum capable of evading
antimalarials are the prime concern to malaria control. The currently effective
drug, artemisinin (ART), is under threat due to detection of ART-resistant P.
falciparum parasites in the Southeast Asian countries. It has been shown that
amino acid (AA) mutations at the P. falciparum Kelch13 (Pfk13) gene provide
resistance to ART. Nigeria, a part of the Sub-Saharan Africa, is highly endemic
to malaria, contributing quite significantly to malaria, and resistance to
chloroquine (CQ) and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) combination drugs has already
been reported. Since artemisinin combined therapy (ACT) is the first-line drug
for treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Nigeria and five amino acid mutations
have been validated in the Pfk13 gene alongside with candidate mutations for ART 
resistance, we performed molecular surveillance for mutations (following PCR and 
DNA sequence analyses) in this gene from two southwestern states of Nigeria.
Statistical analyses of DNA sequences were also performed following different
evolutionary models. None of the different validated and candidate AA mutations
of Pfk13 gene conferring resistance to ART could be detected in P. falciparum
sampled in the two southwestern states of Nigeria. In addition, DNA sequencing
and sequence analyses indicated neither evolutionary selection pressure on the
Pfk13 gene nor association of mutations in Pfk13 gene with mutations of other
three genes conferring resistance to CQ and SP. Therefore, based on the
monomorphism at the Pfk13 gene and nonassociation of mutations of this gene with 
mutations in three other drug-resistant genes in malaria parasite P. falciparum, 
it can be proposed that malaria public health is not under immediate threat in
southwestern Nigeria concerning ART resistance.

Many US immigrant populations develop metabolic diseases post immigration, but
the causes are not well understood. Although the microbiome plays a role in
metabolic disease, there have been no studies measuring the effects of US
immigration on the gut microbiome. We collected stool, dietary recalls, and
anthropometrics from 514 Hmong and Karen individuals living in Thailand and the
United States, including first- and second-generation immigrants and 19 Karen
individuals sampled before and after immigration, as well as from 36 US-born
European American individuals. Using 16S and deep shotgun metagenomic DNA
sequencing, we found that migration from a non-Western country to the United
States is associated with immediate loss of gut microbiome diversity and function
in which US-associated strains and functions displace native strains and
functions. These effects increase with duration of US residence and are
compounded by obesity and across generations.

BACKGROUND Human trichinellosis is a foodborne parasitic zoonotic disease caused 
by ingestion of raw or undercooked meat infected with nematode larvae of the
genus Trichinella. In the USA, sporadic cases and outbreaks caused by the
consumption of wild game meat infected with Trichinella have been reported. The
current methods for diagnosis such as serology and microscopy are not specific,
may result in false negative results, and cannot differentiate encapsulated
Trichinella larvae to species level. The molecular protocols currently available 
for the differentiation of all encapsulate Trichinella species prevalent in North
America have some limitations such as the inability to identify and resolve the
presence of several Trichinella species in a single test. OBJECTIVES/METHODS In
this study we developed and evaluated a multiplex TaqMan quantitative real-time
polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay, which can simultaneously detect, identify
and differentiate all species of encapsulated Trichinella occurring in North
America i.e., T. nativa, T. spiralis, T. murrelli and Trichinella T6, even in
cases of multiple infection in a single sample. We investigated two human
biopsies and 35 wild animal meat samples considered as having a high likelihood
of harboring Trichinella larvae obtained from the United States during 2009-2017.
FINDINGS Using the multiplex assay describe here, 22 (59%) samples that tested
positive contained Trichinella spp., were identified as: T. nativa (n = 7,
including a human biopsy), T. spiralis (n = 9, including a human biopsy), T.
murrelli (n = 3), Trichinella T6 (n = 1). Results also included two rare mixed
infection cases in bears, a T. nativa/T. spiralis from Alaska and a T.
spiralis/Trichinella T6 from California. The species identifications were
confirmed using a conventional PCR targeting the rRNA ITS1-ITS2 region, followed 
by DNA sequencing analysis. The estimated limit of detection (LOD) was
approximately seven larvae per gram of meat. MAIN CONCLUSIONS Differentiation of 
Trichinella spp. is needed to improve efforts on identification of case, optimize
food safety control and better understand the geographic distribution of
Trichinella species. The Trichinella qPCR multiplex proved to be a robust, easy
to perform assay and is presented as an improved technique for identification of 
all known encapsulated species occurring in North America continent.

BACKGROUND: Protozoan parasites such as Giardia duodenalis, Cryptosporidium spp.,
Cyclospora cayetanensis, Toxoplasma gondii and Entamoeba histolytica represent a 
great challenge to the systems producing water for human consumption because
their cystic forms are persistent in the environment and resist to the
disinfection methods conventionally used for their control. In this study, we
investigated the presence of these protozoan pathogens in both raw and treated
water samples used for the production of drinking water in Nariño Department,
southwest Colombia. We collected 110 water samples (10 lof each sample) and
analyzed them with real-time PCR (qPCR). qPCR-positive samples were genotyped
with PCR and DNA sequencing.
RESULTS: Giardia duodenalis was detected in 35/110 (31.8%) of the samples and
Cryptosporidium spp. in 9/110 (8.2%) of the samples; no sample was positive for
T. gondii, E. histolytica or C. cayetanensis. Giardia duodenalis was detected in 
samples of both raw water (Drinking Water Treatment Plants (DWTP):
47.83%;Drinking Water Rural Plants (DWRP): 18.42%) and water collected either
after conventional physicochemical treatment (26.09%) or after disinfection by
chlorine (50%), whereas Cryptosporidium spp. were only detected in raw waters
(DWTP: 17.39%; DWRP: 13.16%). The two pathogens were detected in both types of
treatment plants supplying water to urban areas and to rural zones. Analysis of
gdh and tpi markers identified assemblages AI, AII and H of G. duodenalis, while 
analysis of the small subunit rRNA and gp60 markers of Cryptosporidium-positive
samples identified C. parvum (Subtype IIcA5G3c), C. galli, C. molnari,
Cryptosporidium sp. genotype II of bats and Cryptosporidium sp. genotype VIII of 
birds.
CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained demonstrate the presence of protozoan parasites
in the water of the study region, and the need to improve the surveillance
systems for these pathogens and identify the corresponding sources of
contamination.

BACKGROUND: Asymptomatic infections with sub-microscopic Plasmodium serve as a
silent reservoir of disease, critical to sustaining a low level of remanent
malaria in the population. These infections must be effectively identified and
targeted for elimination. The sensitivity of light microscopy, the traditional
method used for diagnosing Plasmodium infections, is frequently insufficient for 
detecting asymptomatic infections due to the low density of parasitaemia. The
objective of this study was to explore the current prevalence of asymptomatic
sub-microscopic Plasmodium carriages to evaluate the parasite reservoir amongst
residents from 7 hamlets in Tak Province in northwestern Thailand using a highly 
sensitive molecular method.
METHODS: Malaria infection was screened in a real-world setting from 3650
finger-prick blood specimens collected in a mass cross-sectional survey using
light microscopy and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). LAMP results 
were later confirmed in a laboratory setting in Bangkok using nested PCR,
restriction enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing. The association of malaria
infection with demographic factors was explored.
RESULTS: Parasite prevalence was 0.27% (10/3650) as determined by microscopy.
Sub-microscopic infection prevalence was 2.33% (85/3650) by LAMP. Of these, 30.6%
(26/85) were infected with Plasmodium falciparum, 52.9% (45/85) with Plasmodium
vivax, 2.4% (2/85) with Plasmodium malariae, 4.7% (4/85) with mixed P. falciparum
and P. vivax, and 9.4% (8/85) had parasite densities too low for species
identification. Asymptomatic carriages (T < 37.5 °C) accounted for 95% (76/80) of
all sub-microscopic cases with the highest prevalence occurring in the subjects
31-45 years of age (p ≤ 0.035). Participants working on plantations or as
merchants had an increased infection risk. Evaluation by microscopy identified
10.53% (10/95) of all Plasmodium infected participants.
CONCLUSION: Participants carrying asymptomatic Plasmodium infections with
sub-microscopic parasite densities are considerable in this area. These findings 
provide the true disease burden and risk factors in this region. This information
helps to direct policy makers towards better schemes and delivery of targeted
interventions. Moreover, this is the first study to use LAMP in mass screening
for sub-clinical and sub-microscopic infections in a field setting in Thailand.
LAMP proves to be a sensitive and field-deployable assay suitable for national
malaria control screening campaigns.

BACKGROUND: Malaria is the leading cause of global paediatric mortality in
children below 5 years of age. The number of fatalities has reduced significantly
due to an expansion of control interventions but the development of new
technologies remains necessary in order to achieve elimination. Recent attention 
has been focused on the release of genetically modified (GM) mosquitoes into
natural vector populations as a mechanism of interrupting parasite transmission
but despite successful in vivo laboratory studies, a detailed population genetic 
assessment, which must first precede any proposed field trial, has yet to be
undertaken systematically. Here, the genetic structure of Anopheles gambiae
populations in north-western Lake Victoria is explored to assess their
suitability as candidates for a pilot field study release of GM mosquitoes.
METHODS: 478 Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes were collected from six locations and a
subset (N = 96) was selected for restriction site-associated DNA sequencing
(RADseq). The resulting single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) marker set was
analysed for effective size (Ne), connectivity and population structure (PCA,
FST).
RESULTS: 5175 high-quality genome-wide SNPs were identified. A principal
components analysis (PCA) of the collinear genomic regions illustrated that
individuals clustered in concordance with geographic origin with some overlap
between sites. Genetic differentiation between populations was varied with
inter-island comparisons having the highest values (median FST 0.0480-0.0846). Ne
estimates were generally small (124.2-1920.3).
CONCLUSIONS: A reduced-representation SNP marker set for genome-wide An. gambiae 
genetic analysis in the north-western Lake Victoria basin is reported. Island
populations demonstrated low to moderate genetic differentiation and greater
structure suggesting some limitation to migration. Smaller estimates of Ne
indicate that an introduced effector transgene will be more susceptible to
genetic drift but to ensure that it is driven to fixation a robust gene drive
mechanism will likely be needed. These findings, together with their favourable
location and suitability for frequent monitoring, indicate that the Ssese Islands
contain several candidate field locations, which merit further evaluation as
potential GM mosquito pilot release sites.

Plasmodium vivax apical membrane antigen-1(PvAMA-1) is a surface protein with
polymorphic sites. This study was aimed to analyze the polymorphic amino acid
residues at PvAMA-1 in different infected age groups. 92 blood samples were
collected from the south and southeast of Iran. The DNA coding for the domain I
(DI), DII, and partial DIII of this antigen was amplified by Nested-PCR, and
sequenced. Nucleotide mutations were found in 49 sites and based on the amino
acid sequence, 30 variable sites were detected. Age distribution of malaria cases
showed that the majority of the patients were between 10 to 30 years old. The
scattering plot haplotypes by age showed an increasing incidence rate with age
during childhood, whereas, incidence was the lowest in patients under five years 
old. Comparison of the polymorphic sites of PvAMA-1 in Iranian isolates with
those found in other geographic regions of the world indicated nine common
variable positions. In addition, a significant dependence was found between some 
particular substitutions and age categories. Dependence between particular
substitutions and age groups suggests that certain residues in AMA-1 are
responsible for clinical attacks in different ages, likely as a result of host
immune pressure. The crystal structure of the PvAMA-1 showed that the amino acid 
substitutions that changed the protein charge were exclusively located in loops
and turns where, the interactions with antibodies could occur. These data provide
the necessary information for an AMA-1 based malaria vaccine design to be
effective across all ages.

Second-generation DNA sequencing techniques generate short reads that can result 
in fragmented genome assemblies. Third-generation sequencing platforms mitigate
this limitation by producing longer reads that span across complex and repetitive
regions. However, the usefulness of such long reads is limited because of high
sequencing error rates. To exploit the full potential of these longer reads, it
is imperative to correct the underlying errors. We propose HECIL-Hybrid Error
Correction with Iterative Learning-a hybrid error correction framework that
determines a correction policy for erroneous long reads, based on optimal
combinations of decision weights obtained from short read alignments. We
demonstrate that HECIL outperforms state-of-the-art error correction algorithms
for an overwhelming majority of evaluation metrics on diverse, real-world data
sets including E. coli, S. cerevisiae, and the malaria vector mosquito A.
funestus. Additionally, we provide an optional avenue of improving the
performance of HECIL's core algorithm by introducing an iterative learning
paradigm that enhances the correction policy at each iteration by incorporating
knowledge gathered from previous iterations via data-driven confidence metrics
assigned to prior corrections.

BACKGROUND: Blood group phenotype variation has been attributed to potential
resistance to pathogen invasion. Variation was mapped in blood donors from
Lampang (northern region) and Saraburi (central region), Thailand, where malaria 
is endemic. The previously unknown blood group allele profiles were characterized
and the data were correlated with phenotypes. The high incidence of the
Vel-negative phenotype previously reported in Thais was investigated.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: DNA from 396 blood donors was analyzed by
matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry.
Outliers were investigated by serology and DNA sequencing. Allele discrimination 
assays for SMIM1 rs1175550A/G and ACKR1 rs118062001C/T were performed and
correlated with antigen expression.
RESULTS: All samples were phenotyped for Rh, MNS, and K. Genotyping/phenotyping
for RhD, K, and S/s showed 100% concordance. Investigation of three RHCE outliers
revealed an e-variant antigen encoded by RHCE*02.22. Screening for rs147357308
(RHCE c.667T) revealed a frequency of 3.3%. MN typing discrepancies in 41 samples
revealed glycophorin variants, of which 40 of 41 were due to Mia . Nine samples
(2.3%) were heterozygous for FY*01W.01 (c.265C > T), and six samples (1.5%) were 
heterozygous for JK*02N.01. All samples were wildtype SMIM1 homozygotes with 97% 
homozygosity for rs1175550A.
CONCLUSIONS: Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass
spectrometry is an efficient method for rapid routine genotyping and
investigation of outliers identified novel variation among our samples. The
expected high prevalence of the Mi(a+) phenotype was observed from both regions. 
Of potential clinical relevance in a region where transfusion-dependent
thalassemia is common, we identified two RHCE*02 alleles known to encode an
e-variant antigen.

BACKGROUND: Primaquine (PQ) is recommended as an addition to standard malaria
treatments in pre-elimination settings due to its pronounced activity against
mature Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes, the parasite stage responsible for
onward transmission to mosquitoes. However, PQ may trigger haemolysis in
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)-deficient individuals. Additional human 
genetic factors, including polymorphisms in the human cytochrome P450 2D6
(CYP2D6) complex, may negatively influence the efficacy of PQ. This study
assessed the prevalence of G6PD deficiency and two important CYP2D6 variants in
representative pre-elimination settings in South Africa, to inform malaria
elimination strategies.
METHODS: Volunteers (n = 248) attending six primary health care facilities in a
malaria-endemic region of South Africa were enrolled between October and November
2015. G6PD status was determined phenotypically, using a CareStart™ G6PD rapid
diagnostic test (RDT), and genotypically for two common African G6PD variants,
namely A+ (A376G) and A- (G202A, A542T, G680T & T968C) by PCR, restriction
fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) and DNA sequencing. CYP2D6*4 and CYP2D6*17
variants were determined with PCR and RFLP.
RESULTS: A prevalence of 13% (33/248) G6PD deficiency was observed in the cohort 
by G6PD RDT whilst by genotypic assessment, 32% (79/248) were A+ and 3.2% were
A-, respectively. Among the male participants, 11% (6/55) were G6PD A-
hemizygous; among females 1% (2/193) were G6PD A- homozygous and 16% (32/193)
G6PD A- heterozygous. The strength of agreement between phenotyping and
genotyping result was fair (Cohens Kappa κ = 0.310). The negative predictive
value for the G6PD RDT for detecting hemizygous, homozygous and heterozygous
individuals was 0.88 (95% CI 0.85-0.91), compared to the more sensitive
genotyping. The CYP2D6*4 allele frequencies for CYP2D6*4 (inferred poor
metabolizer phenotype) and CYP2D6*17 (inferred intermediate metabolizer
phenotype) were 3.2 and 19.5%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Phenotypic and genotypic analyses both detected low prevalence of
G6PD deficiency and the CYP2D6*4 variants. These findings, combined with
increasing data confirming safety of single low-dose PQ in individuals with
African variants of G6PD deficiency, supports the deployment of single low-dose
PQ as a gametocytocidal drug. PQ would pose minimal risks to the study
populations and could be a useful elimination strategy in the study area.

BACKGROUND: Plasmodium vivax remains a potential cause of morbidity and mortality
for people living where it is endemic. Understanding the regional genetic
diversity of P. vivax is valuable for studying population dynamics and tracing
the origins of parasites. The Plasmodium vivax circumsporozoite gene (PvCSP) is
highly polymorphic and has been used previously as a marker in P. vivax
population studies. The aim of this study is to investigate the genetic diversity
of the PvCSP, to provide more genetic polymorphism data for further studies on
P. vivax population structure, and tracking of the origin of clinical cases.
METHODS: Nested PCR and DNA sequencing of the PvCSP were performed to obtain
nucleotide sequences of P. vivax isolates collected from Zhejiang province,
China, between 2006 and 2014. To investigate the genetic diversity of PvCSP, the 
nucleotide sequences and amino acid sequences of the PvCSP were analyzed using
DNAstar, Mega software and the phylogenetic tree constructed. The relatedness
between the polymorphism and infection source were also analyzed using the SPSS
software.
RESULTS: The 66 P. vivax isolates collected from Zhejiang province were either
indigenous cases or cases imported from different regions of the world. All 66
P. vivax isolates belonged to the VK210 variant. Fourteen different Peptide
Repeat Motifs (PRMs) were detected in the Central Repeat Region (CRR) of PvCSP,
among which, two PRMs of GDRADGQPA and GDRAAGQPA were widely distributed in all
isolates. Several polymorphic characteristics of the VK210 variant were observed,
including the insertion sequence of 12 peptides, the frequency of the GGNA
repeat, the frequency of the PRMs repeat in CRR, and the frequency of the PRM of 
GNGAGGQAA repeat, which were indicative for tracking the parasite.
CONCLUSION: This study presents abundant genetic diversity in the PvCSP marker
among P. vivax strains around the world. The genetic data are valuable to expand 
the polymorphism information on P. vivax, which could be helpful for further
study on population dynamics and tracking the origin of P. vivax.

BACKGROUND: In Niger, malaria transmission is markedly seasonal with most of the 
disease burden occurring in children during the rainy season. Seasonal malaria
chemoprevention (SMC) with amodiaquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (AQ + SP)
is recommended in the country to be administered monthly just before and during
the rainy season. Moreover, clinical decisions on use of SP for intermittent
preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) now depend upon the validated molecular 
markers for SP resistance in Plasmodium falciparum observed in the local parasite
population. However, little is known about molecular markers of resistance for
either SP or AQ in the south of Niger. To address this question, clinical samples
which met clinical and biological criteria, were collected in Gabi, Madarounfa
district, Maradi region, Niger in 2011-2012 (before SMC implementation).
Molecular markers of resistance to pyrimethamine (pfdhfr), sulfadoxine (pfdhps)
and amodiaquine (pfmdr1) were assessed by DNA sequencing.
RESULTS: Prior to SMC implementation, the samples showed a high proportion of
clinical samples that carried the pfdhfr 51I/59R/108N haplotype associated with
resistance to pyrimethamine and pfdhps 436A/F/H and 437G mutations associated
with reduced susceptibility to sulfadoxine. In contrast mutations in codons 581G,
and 613S in the pfdhps gene, and in pfmdr1, 86Y, 184Y, 1042D and 1246Y associated
with resistance to amodiaquine, were less frequently observed. Importantly,
pfdhfr I164L and pfdhps K540E mutations shown to be the most clinically relevant 
markers for high level clinical resistance to SP were not detected in Gabi.
CONCLUSIONS: Although parasites with genotypes associated with the highest levels
of resistance to AQ + SP are not yet common in this setting, their importance for
deployment of SMC and IPTp dictates that monitoring of these markers of
resistance should accompany these interventions. This study also highlights the
parasite heterogeneity within a small spatial area and the need to use caution
when extrapolating results from surveys of molecular markers of resistance in a
single site to inform regional policy decisions.

BACKGROUND: Malaria is still one of the serious public health problems in Grande 
Comore Island, although the number of annual cases has been greatly reduced in
recent years. A better understanding of malaria parasite population diversity and
transmission dynamics is critical for assessing the effectiveness of malaria
control measures. The objective of this study is to investigate temporal changes 
in genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum populations and multiplicity of
infection (MOI) in Grande Comore 10 years after introduction of ACT.
METHODS: A total of 232 P. falciparum clinical isolates were collected from the
Grande Comore Island during two sampling periods (118 for 2006‒2007 group, and
114 for 2013‒2016 group). Parasite isolates were characterized for genetic
diversity and complexity of infection by genotyping polymorphic regions in
merozoite surface protein gene 1 (msp-1), msp-2, and msp-3 using nested PCR and
DNA sequencing.
RESULTS: Three msp-1 alleles (K1, MAD20, and RO33), two msp-2 alleles (FC27 and
3D7), and two msp-3 alleles (K1 and 3D7) were detected in parasites of both
sampling periods. The RO33 allele of msp-1 (84.8%), 3D7 allele of msp-2 (90.8%), 
and K1 allele of msp-3 (66.7%) were the predominant allelic types in isolates
from 2006-2007 group. In contrast, the RO33 allele of msp-1 (63.4%), FC27 allele 
of msp-2 (91.1%), and 3D7 allele of msp-3 (53.5%) were the most prevalent among
isolates from the 2013-2016 group. Compared with the 2006‒2007 group, polyclonal 
infection rates of msp-1 (from 76.7 to 29.1%, P < 0.01) and msp-2 (from 62.4 to
28.3%, P < 0.01) allelic types were significantly decreased in those from
2013‒2016 group. Similarly, the MOIs for both msp-1 and msp-2 were higher in P.
falciparum isolates in the 2006-2007 group than those in 2013-2016 group
(MOI = 3.11 vs 1.63 for msp-1; MOI = 2.75 vs 1.35 for msp-2). DNA sequencing
analyses also revealed reduced numbers of distinct sequence variants in the three
genes from 2006‒2007 to 2013‒2016: msp-1, from 32 to 23 (about 28% decline);
msp-2 from 29 to 21 (about 28% decline), and msp-3 from 11 to 3 (about 72%
decline).
CONCLUSIONS: The present data showed dramatic reduction in genetic diversity and 
MOI among Grande Comore P. falciparum populations over the course of the study,
suggesting a trend of decreasing malaria transmission intensity and genetic
diversity in Grande Comore Island. These data provide valuable information for
surveillance of P. falciparum infection and for assessing the appropriateness of 
the current malarial control strategies in the endemic area.

BACKGROUND: Point mutations in Plasmodium falciparum dihydrofolate reductase
(Pfdhfr) and dihydropteroate synthase (Pfdhps) genes which confer resistance to
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) occur at increasing rates. The present study aimed
to identify Pfdhfr and Pfdhps mutations in P. falciparum isolates recovered from 
women who received two doses of SP during pregnancy in Bandundu, the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC).
METHODS: A total of 48 women with confirmed P. falciparum infection were enrolled
in the study. Finger-prick blood samples that were collected on filter paper at
the time of delivery were used for DNA isolation. Pfdhfr and Pfdhps genes were
amplified by a nested PCR protocol. DNA sequencing was performed on both strands,
and the point mutations were analysed.
RESULTS: All of the 48 (100.0%) P. falciparum isolates carried at least one
polymorphism in both genes. The wild-type haplotypes of Pfdhfr (CNCSI [C50, N51, 
C59, S108, I164]) and Pfdhps (SAKAA [S436, A437, K540, A581, A613]) were not
observed in the study. In Pfdhfr, N51I (85.4%), C59R (60.4%), and S108N (100.0%) 
polymorphisms were detected. Triple mutation (CIRNI) (mutant amino acids are
underlined) was the most prevalent (47.9%) Pfdhfr haplotype. In the study, all P.
falciparum isolates (100.0%) harboured the A437G allele in Pfdhps gene. Also,
K540E and A581G polymorphisms were observed in one (2.1%) isolate. Single mutant 
haplotype (SGKAA) was detected in 97.9% of the isolates. Mutant Pfdhfr and Pfdhps
allele combinations revealed quintuple (CICNI-SGEGA; 2.1%), quadruple
(CIRNI-SGKAA; 47.9%), triple (CICNI-SGKAA; 35.4%, CNRNI-SGKAA; 12.5%), and double
(CNCNI-SGKAA; 2.1%) haplotypes.
CONCLUSIONS: In the study, the rate of SGEGA haplotype was low (2.1%). Although
K540E and A581G alleles are more common in Eastern Africa, a distinct lineage of 
SGEGA is also present in the DRC, which is located in Central Africa. This
haplotype is associated with decreased efficacy of SP in pregnant women and
infants, therefore, it should be carefully considered in the DRC and SP
resistance should be routinely monitored.

BACKGROUND: Antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) have been recommended
by the World Health Organization for use in remote areas to improve malaria case 
management. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of Plasmodium falciparum is one of the
main parasite antigens employed by various commercial RDTs. It has been
hypothesized that the poor detection of LDH-based RDTs is attributed in part to
the sequence diversity of the gene. To test this, the present study aimed to
investigate the genetic diversity of the P. falciparum ldh gene in Thailand and
to construct the map of LDH sequence diversity in P. falciparum populations
worldwide.
METHODS: The ldh gene was sequenced for 50 P. falciparum isolates in Thailand and
compared with hundreds of sequences from P. falciparum populations worldwide.
Several indices of molecular variation were calculated, including the proportion 
of polymorphic sites, the average nucleotide diversity index (π), and the
haplotype diversity index (H). Tests of positive selection and neutrality tests
were performed to determine signatures of natural selection on the gene. Mean
genetic distance within and between species of Plasmodium ldh was analysed to
infer evolutionary relationships.
RESULTS: Nucleotide sequences of P. falciparum ldh could be classified into 9
alleles, encoding 5 isoforms of LDH. L1a was the most common allelic type and was
distributed in P. falciparum populations worldwide. Plasmodium falciparum ldh
sequences were highly conserved, with haplotype and nucleotide diversity values
of 0.203 and 0.0004, respectively. The extremely low genetic diversity was
maintained by purifying selection, likely due to functional constraints.
Phylogenetic analysis inferred the close genetic relationship of P. falciparum to
malaria parasites of great apes, rather than to other human malaria parasites.
CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed the global genetic variation of the ldh gene in 
P. falciparum, providing knowledge for improving detection of LDH-based RDTs and 
supporting the candidacy of LDH as a therapeutic drug target.

Efforts to knock out Plasmodium falciparum calcium-dependent protein kinase 1
(PfCDPK1) from asexual erythrocytic stage have not been successful, indicating an
indispensable role of the enzyme in asexual growth. We recently reported
generation of a transgenic parasite with mutant CDPK1 [Bansal A, et al. (2016)
MBio 7:e02011-16]. The mutant CDPK1 (T145M) had reduced activity of
transphosphorylation. We reasoned that CDPK1 could be disrupted in the mutant
parasites. Consistent with this assumption, CDPK1 was successfully disrupted in
the mutant parasites using CRISPR/Cas9. We and others could not disrupt PfCDPK1
in the WT parasites. The CDPK1 KO parasites show a slow growth rate compared with
the WT and the CDPK1 T145M parasites. Additionally, the CDPK1 KO parasites show a
defect in both male and female gametogenesis and could not establish an infection
in mosquitoes. Complementation of the KO parasite with full-length PfCDPK1
partially rescued the asexual growth defect and mosquito infection. Comparative
global transcriptomics of WT and the CDPK1 KO schizonts using RNA-seq show
significantly high transcript expression of gametocyte-specific genes in the
CDPK1 KO parasites. This study conclusively demonstrates that CDPK1 is a good
target for developing transmission-blocking drugs.

BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum is the deadliest malaria parasite. Currently,
there are seldom commercial antibodies against P. falciparum proteins, which
greatly limits the study on Plasmodium. CRISPR/Cas9 is an efficient genome
editing method, which has been employed in various organisms. However, the use of
this technique in P. falciparum is still limited to gene knockout, site-specific 
mutation and generation of green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter line with
disruption of inserted sites.
RESULTS: We have adapted the CRISPR/Cas9 system to add commercial tag sequences
to endogenous genes of P. falciparum. To add HA or HA-TY1 tags to ck2β1, ck2α and
stk, pL6cs-hDHFR-ck2β1/ck2α/stk was constructed, which contained sequences of
tags, specific homologous arms, and sgRNA. The P. falciparum 3D7 strain was
subsequently transfected with pUF1-BSD-Cas9 and pL6cs-hDHFR-ck2β1/ck2α/stk
plasmids via electroporation. After that, BSD and WR99210 drugs were added to the
culture to screen parasites containing both plasmids. Twenty days after
electroporation, live parasites appeared and were collected to check the tagging 
by PCR, DNA sequencing, Western blotting and immuno-fluorescence assays. The
results showed that the tags were successfully integrated into the C-terminus of 
these three proteins.
CONCLUSIONS: We have improved the method to integrate tags to Plasmodium
falciparum genes using the CRISPR/Cas9 method, which lays the foundation for
further study of Plasmodium falciparum at the molecular level.

SCOPE: Haptoglobin (Hp), an acute phase inflammatory protein is associated with
malaria pathogenesis in several proteomics and genomics studies. The Hp gene has 
two co-dominant alleles: Hp1 and Hp2 that produce three genotypes: Hp1/Hp1,
Hp1/Hp2 and Hp2/Hp2.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In this study, validation of the proteomics data with
Multiple Reaction Monitoring Mass Spectroscopy (MRM-MS) is performed and the
association of the Hp gene variants with severe, non-severe malaria and community
(healthy) controls using genotyping PCRs and DNA sequencing is analysed.
RESULTS: Highly significant values of Hp is observed in the MRM assay that show a
correlation with severity of malaria and is clearly distinguished from another
febrile disease, dengue. Moreover, the Hp2/Hp2 genotype is seen in high
percentages in non-severe malaria patients (74%) and community controls (72%)
whereas patients diagnosed with severe malaria show only (31%) of this genotype. 
Sequencing of the Hp promoter region reveals three SNPs along with 10 unique
haplotypes, out of which five are associated with non-severe and three with
severe malaria populations (χ2  = 130; df = 18; p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This proteo-genomic study focuses on the
correlation of the Hp protein and gene with malaria, thus highlighting the
pivotal role of this acute phase immune gene in malaria pathogenesis.

Comment in
    Lancet Glob Health. 2017 Oct;5(10 ):e961-e962.

BACKGROUND: Malaria was eliminated from southern and southeastern Brazil over 50 
years ago. However, an increasing number of autochthonous episodes attributed to 
Plasmodium vivax have recently been reported from the Atlantic Forest region of
Rio de Janeiro state. As the P vivax-like non-human primate malaria parasite
species Plasmodium simium is locally enzootic, we performed a molecular
epidemiological investigation to determine whether zoonotic malaria transmission 
is occurring.
METHODS: We examined blood samples from patients presenting with signs or
symptoms suggestive of malaria as well as from local howler monkeys by microscopy
and PCR. Samples were included from individuals if they had a history of travel
to or resided in areas within the Rio de Janeiro Atlantic Forest, but not if they
had malaria prophylaxis, blood transfusion or tissue or organ transplantation, or
had travelled to known malaria endemic areas in the preceding year. Additionally,
we developed a molecular assay based on sequencing of the parasite mitochondrial 
genome to distinguish between P vivax and P simium, and applied this assay to 33 
cases from outbreaks that occurred in 2015, and 2016.
FINDINGS: A total of 49 autochthonous malaria cases were reported in 2015-16.
Most patients were male, with a mean age of 44 years (SD 14·6), and 82% lived in 
urban areas of Rio de Janeiro state and had visited the Atlantic Forest for
leisure or work-related activities. 33 cases were used for mitochondrial DNA
sequencing. The assay was successfully performed for 28 samples, and all were
shown to be P simium, indicative of zoonotic transmission of this species to
human beings in this region. Sequencing of the whole mitochondrial genome of
three of these cases showed that P simium is most closely related to P vivax
parasites from South America. The malaria outbreaks in this region were caused by
P simium, previously considered to be a monkey-specific malaria parasite, related
to but distinct from P vivax, and which has never conclusively been shown to
infect people before.
INTERPRETATION: This unequivocal demonstration of zoonotic transmission, 50 years
after the only previous report of P simium in people, leads to the possibility
that this parasite has always infected people in this region, but that it has
been consistently misdiagnosed as P vivax because of an absence of molecular
typing techniques. Thorough screening of local non-human primates and mosquitoes 
(Anopheline) is required to evaluate the extent of this newly recognised zoonotic
threat to public health and malaria elimination in Brazil.

BACKGROUND: Henan Province has been in the malaria elimination stage, with all
reports of the disease being imported since 2012 and over 90% coming from Africa.
Surveillance and population studies are essential for the early detection and
subsequent prevention of the spread of drug resistance. The K13-propeller gene
was recently identified as a proposed molecular marker of artemisinin (ART)
resistance. In this study, we detected mutations of the K13-propeller gene in
samples taken from imported malaria cases in Henan Province from 2012 to 2015.
METHODS: There were 483 samples that were obtained from Plasmodium
falciparum-infected malaria migrant workers who returned to Henan Province from
Africa between 2012 and 2015. The single nucleotide polymorphisms in the
K13-propeller gene were assessed by nested PCR with DNA sequencing. Frequency and
geographic difference of K13-propeller gene mutant types were analyzed.
RESULTS: Of 483 patients, 476 were cured and 7 died. There were no K13-propeller 
mutations in the blood samples from the 7 patients who died, but there were 23
different genotypes of the K13-propeller that were observed in 24 (4.97%) of the 
samples. C580Y, which was the predominant one in the resistance of ART, was not
detected in the samples, but R539T and P574L which have also been associated with
ART resistance, were observed in two samples from Angola and Equatorial Guinea.
No mutations were detected in 11 samples from North Africa. The frequency of the 
K13-propeller was 6.50% (8/123) in Central Africa, followed by East Africa (1/19,
5.26%), West Africa (9/198, 4.55%) and South Africa (6/132, 4.55%). There was no 
significant difference among these four areas (P = 0.795).
CONCLUSION: R539T and P574L were found in migrant workers who traveled from
Africa to Henan Province, although the frequency of the K13-propeller mutants was
low. These data may enrich the molecular surveillance of antimalarial resistance 
and will be helpful for developing and updating the antimalarial policy in Henan 
Province.

BACKGROUND: Host genetics play an important role in Plasmodium falciparum malaria
susceptibility. However, information on host genetic factors and their
relationships with malaria in the vaccine trial site of Iganga, Uganda is
limited. The main objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of
selected host genetic markers and their relationship to malaria incidence in the 
vaccine trial site of Iganga, Uganda. In a 1-year longitudinal cohort study, 423 
children aged below 9 years were recruited and their malaria episodes were
investigated. Host genetic polymorphisms were assessed by PCR-RFLP, haemoglobin
electrophoresis and DNA sequencing. Using a multivariate negative binomial
regression model, estimates of the impact of human genetic polymorphisms on
malaria incidence were performed. In all statistical tests, a P value of <0.05
was considered as significant.
RESULTS: The prevalences of sickle cell haemoglobin trait, G6PD c.202 G>A (rs
1050828) and NOS2 -954 G>C (rs 1800482) variants were 26.6, 22.7 and 17.3%,
respectively. Inducible nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2 -954 G>C; rs 1800482)
heterozygosity was associated with lower incidence of malaria in all age groups
{Adjusted incident rates ratio (aIRR) 0.59; 95% CI [0.386-0.887]; P = 0.012)}.
About 4% of study subjects had co-existence of sickle cell Hb trait and G6PD
deficiency. Sickle cell Hb heterozygotes (Hb AS) aged less than 1 year
experienced significantly more malaria episodes annually than children with
normal haemoglobin (Hb AA) {aIRR = 1.98; 95% CI [1.240-3.175]; P = 0.004}. There 
was no significant influence of the sickle cell trait on malaria incidence among 
older children of 1-9 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Mutation (NOS2 -954 G>C; rs 1800482) of nitric oxide synthase 2 gene
promoter was associated with a lower incidence of acute malaria. The normal
haemoglobin (wild genotype; HbAA) was associated with reduced malaria incidence
rates during the first year of life. More understanding of the interplay between 
host genetics and malaria susceptibility is required.

BACKGROUND: Malaria is common in hilly, forested areas along national borders in 
Southeast Asia. Insecticide resistance in malaria vectors has been detected in a 
few countries in the Greater Mekong sub-region (GMS), representing a threat to
malaria control and prevention. This study aims to determine the insecticide
resistance status of Anopheles mosquitoes in Ubon Ratchathani province,
northeastern Thailand, where increasing number of malaria cases were reported
recently.
METHODS: Mosquitoes were collected in 2013-2015 using human landing and cattle
bait collections in six sites during both the rainy and dry seasons. Mosquitoes
were first morphologically identified to species and their susceptibility status 
to deltamethrin (0.05%), permethrin (0.75%) and DDT (4%) investigated, according 
to WHO guidelines. Bioassays with the synergists PBO and DEF were carried out to 
address the role of detoxifying enzymes in insecticide resistance. DNA sequencing
of a fragment of the voltage-gated sodium channel gene was carried out to detect 
knock-down resistance (kdr) substitutions at position 1014 in resistant species.
RESULTS: Due to low vector abundance, complete bioassays (n ≥ 100 mosquitoes)
were only achieved for Anopheles hyrcanus s.l., which was resistant to all
insecticides tested (mortality ranged from 45 to 87%). Suspected resistance to
DDT was found in Anopheles barbirostris s.l. (mortality 69%), but it was
susceptible to deltamethrin (mortality 97-100%) and permethrin (mortality 100%). 
Although insufficient number of primary vectors were collected, results showed
that Anopheles dirus s.l. and Anopheles maculatus s.l. were susceptible to
deltamethrin (mortality 100%). Anopheles nivipes and Anopheles philippinensis
were susceptible to all three insecticides. PBO significantly increased mortality
to deltamethrin and permethrin in pyrethroid-resistant An. hyrcanus s.l. None of 
the sequenced specimens presented the L1014F or L1014S mutation.
DISCUSSION: This study shows that insecticide resistance is present in potential 
malaria vectors in northeastern Thailand. The absence of kdr mutations in all
Anopheles species tested suggests that metabolic resistance is the main mechanism
of pyrethroid resistance. This study provides new findings about insecticide
susceptibility status of potential malaria vectors in northeastern Thailand that 
are deemed important to guide malaria vector control.

CASE HISTORY A little penguin (Eudyptula minor) of wild origin, in captivity at
Wellington Zoo, became inappetent and lethargic in March 2013. Despite supportive
care in the zoo's wildlife hospital, the bird died within 24 hours. CLINICAL
FINDINGS Weight loss, dehydration, pale mucous membranes, weakness, increased
respiratory effort and biliverdinuria were apparent on physical examination.
Microscopic evaluation of blood smears revealed intra-erythrocytic stages of
Plasmodium spp. and a regenerative reticulocytosis in the absence of anaemia.
PATHOLOGICAL FINDINGS Post-mortem findings included reduced body condition,
dehydration, pulmonary congestion and oedema, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly,
hydropericardium and subcutaneous oedema. Histopathological findings included
protozoal organisms in sections of lung, liver and spleen. A marked, diffuse,
sub-acute interstitial histiocytic pneumonia was present. Accumulation of
haemosiderin was noted in the Kupffer cells of the liver and in histiocytic-type 
cells in the spleen. MOLECULAR TESTING DNA was extracted from frozen portions of 
the liver. Nested PCR results and DNA sequencing confirmed infection of the
deceased little penguin with Plasmodium (Huffia) elongatum lineage GRW06.
DIAGNOSIS Avian malaria due to Plasmodium (Huffia) elongatum GRW06 RETROSPECTIVE 
INVESTIGATION A retrospective analysis of 294 little penguin cases in the Massey 
University post-mortem database revealed three other potential avian malaria
cases. Analysis of archived tissues using a nested PCR for Plasmodium spp.
followed by DNA sequencing revealed that a little penguin which died at Auckland 
Zoo was infected with P. elongatum GRW06 and two wild little penguins found dead 
on New Zealand beaches were infected with P. relictum SGS1 and Plasmodium. sp.
lineage LINN1. Therefore, the overall frequency of deaths in little penguins
associated with avian malaria was 4/295 (1.36%). CLINICAL RELEVANCE Our results
suggest that avian malaria is associated with sporadic mortality in New Zealand's
little penguins both in the wild and in captivity, but there is no evidence of
mass mortality events due to Plasmodium spp. infection.

BACKGROUND: The burden of falciparum malaria is especially high in sub-Saharan
Africa. Differences in pressure from host immunity and antimalarial drugs lead to
adaptive changes responsible for high level of genetic variations within and
between the parasite populations. Population-specific genetic studies to survey
for genes under positive or balancing selection resulting from drug pressure or
host immunity will allow for refinement of interventions.
METHODS: We performed a pooled sequencing (pool-seq) of the genomes of 100
Plasmodium falciparum isolates from Nigeria. We explored allele-frequency based
neutrality test (Tajima's D) and integrated haplotype score (iHS) to identify
genes under selection.
RESULTS: Fourteen shared iHS regions that had at least 2 SNPs with a score > 2.5 
were identified. These regions code for genes that were likely to have been under
strong directional selection. Two of these genes were the chloroquine resistance 
transporter (CRT) on chromosome 7 and the multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1) on
chromosome 5. There was a weak signature of selection in the dihydrofolate
reductase (DHFR) gene on chromosome 4 and MDR5 genes on chromosome 13, with only 
2 and 3 SNPs respectively identified within the iHS window. We observed strong
selection pressure attributable to continued chloroquine and
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine use despite their official proscription for the
treatment of uncomplicated malaria. There was also a major selective sweep on
chromosome 6 which had 32 SNPs within the shared iHS region. Tajima's D of
circumsporozoite protein (CSP), erythrocyte-binding antigen (EBA-175), merozoite 
surface proteins - MSP3 and MSP7, merozoite surface protein duffy binding-like
(MSPDBL2) and serine repeat antigen (SERA-5) were 1.38, 1.29, 0.73, 0.84 and
0.21, respectively.
CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated the use of pool-seq to understand genomic
patterns of selection and variability in P. falciparum from Nigeria, which bears 
the highest burden of infections. This investigation identified known genomic
signatures of selection from drug pressure and host immunity. This is evidence
that P. falciparum populations explore common adaptive strategies that can be
targeted for the development of new interventions.

BACKGROUND: The Plasmodium falciparum multidrug resistance 1 (PfMDR1), P.
falciparum Ca2+-ATPase (PfATP6) and Kelch-13 propeller domain (PfK13) loci are
molecular markers of parasite susceptibility to anti-malarial drugs. Their
frequency distributions were determined in the isolates collected from children
with severe malaria originating from three African countries.
METHODS: Samples from 287 children with severe malaria [(Gabon: n = 114); (Ghana:
n = 89); (Kenya: n = 84)] were genotyped for pfmdr1, pfatp6 and pfk13 loci by DNA
sequencing and assessing pfmdr1 copy number variation (CNV) by real-time PCR.
RESULTS: Pfmdr1-N86Y mutation was detected in 48, 10 and 10% in Lambaréné, Kumasi
and Kisumu, respectively. At codon 184, the prevalence of the mutation was 73% in
Lambaréné, 63% in Kumasi and 49% Kisumu. The S1034C and N1042D variants were
absent at all three sites, while the frequency of the D1246Y mutation was 1, 3
and 13% in Lambaréné, Kumasi and Kisumu, respectively. Isolates with two pfmdr1
gene copy number predominantly harboured the N86Y wild-type allele and were
mostly found in Kumasi (10%) (P < 0.0001). Among the main pfmdr1 haplotypes (NFD,
NYD and YFD), NYD was associated with highest parasitaemia (P = 0.04). At the
pfatp6 locus, H243Y and A623E mutations were observed at very low frequency at
all three sites. The prevalence of the pfatp6 E431K variant was 6, 18 and 17% in 
Lambaréné, Kumasi and Kisumu, respectively. The L263E and S769N mutations were
absent in all isolates. The pfk13 variants associated with artemisinin resistance
in Southeast Asia were not observed. Eleven novel substitutions in the pfk13
locus occurring at low frequency were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Artemisinins are still highly efficacious in large malaria-endemic
regions though declining efficacy has occurred in Southeast Asia. The return of
chloroquine-sensitive strains following the removal of drug pressure is observed.
However, selection of wild-type alleles in the multidrug-resistance gene and the 
increased gene copy number is associated with reduced lumefantrine sensitivity.
This study indicates a need to constantly monitor drug resistance to artemisinin 
in field isolates from malaria-endemic countries.

BACKGROUND: A malaria hotspot in the southeastern region of Mauritania, near the 
Malian border, may hamper malaria control strategies. The objectives were to
estimate the prevalence of genetic polymorphisms associated with drug resistance 
in Plasmodium falciparum isolates and establish baseline data.
METHODS: The study was conducted in two malaria-endemic areas in Hodh Elgharbi,
situated in the Malian-Mauritanian border area. Blood samples were collected from
symptomatic patients. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in Pfcrt, Pfmdr1, Pfdhfr,
and Pfdhps were genotyped using PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism, DNA
sequencing and primer extension. The Pfmdr1 gene copy number was determined by
real-time PCR.
RESULTS: Of 280 P. falciparum-infected patients, 193 (68.9%) carried the Pfcrt
76T mutant allele. The Pfmdr1 86Y and 184F mutations were found in 61 (23.1%) of 
264 isolates and 167 (67.6%) of 247 samples that were successfully genotyped,
respectively. Pfmdr1 mutant alleles 1034C, 1042D and 1246Y were rarely observed. 
Of 102 P. falciparum isolates analysed, ten (9.8%) had more than one copy of
Pfmdr1 gene. The prevalence of isolates harbouring at least triple mutant Pfdhfr 
51I, 59R, 108 N/T was 42% (112/268), of which 42 (37.5%) had an additional Pfdhps
437G mutation. The Pfdhps 540E mutation was observed in four isolates (1.5%),
including three associated with Pfdhfr triple mutant. Only two quintuple mutants 
(Pfdhfr-51I-59R-108N Pfdhps-437G-540E) were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: The observed mutations in Pfdhfr, Pfdhps, Pfmdr1, and Pfcrt may
jeopardize the future of seasonal malaria chemoprevention based on
amodiaquine-sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, intermittent preventive treatment for
pregnant women using sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, and treatment with
artesunate-amodiaquine. Complementary studies should be carried out to document
the distribution, origin and circulation of P. falciparum populations in this
region and more widely in the country to assess the risk of the spread of
resistance.

BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of data about the susceptibility status of malaria
vectors to Public Health insecticides along the Thailand-Myanmar border. This
lack of data is a limitation to guide malaria vector-control in this region. The 
aim of this study was to assess the susceptibility status of malaria vectors to
deltamethrin, permethrin and DDT and to validate a simple molecular assay for the
detection of knock-down resistance (kdr) mutations in the study area.
METHODS: Anopheles mosquitoes were collected in four sentinel villages during
August and November 2014 and July 2015 using human landing catch and cow bait
collection methods. WHO susceptibility tests were carried out to measure the
mortality and knock-down rates of female mosquitoes to deltamethrin (0.05%),
permethrin (0.75%) and DDT (4%). DNA sequencing of a fragment of the
voltage-gated sodium channel gene was carried out to identify knock-down
resistance (kdr) mutations at position 1014 in mosquitoes surviving exposure to
insecticides.
RESULTS: A total of 6295 Anopheles belonging to ten different species were
bioassayed. Resistance or suspected resistance to pyrethroids was detected in An.
barbirostris (s.l.) (72 and 84% mortality to deltamethrin (n = 504) and
permethrin (n = 493) respectively), An. hyrcanus (s.l.) (33 and 48% mortality to 
deltamethrin (n = 172) and permethrin (n = 154), respectively), An. jamesii (87% 
mortality to deltamethrin, n = 111), An. maculatus (s.l.) (85 and 97% mortality
to deltamethrin (n = 280) and permethrin (n = 264), respectively), An. minimus
(s.l.) (92% mortality, n = 370) and An. vagus (75 and 95% mortality to
deltamethrin (n =148) and permethrin (n = 178), respectively). Resistance or
suspected resistance to DDT was detected in An. barbirostris (s.l.) (74%
mortality, n = 435), An. hyrcanus (s.l.) (57% mortality, n = 91) and An. vagus
(97% mortality, n = 133). The L1014S kdr mutation at both heterozygous and
homozygous state was detected only in An. peditaeniatus (Hyrcanus Group).
CONCLUSION: Resistance to pyrethroids is present along the Thailand-Myanmar
border, and it represents a threat for malaria vector control. Further
investigations are needed to better understand the molecular basis of insecticide
resistance in malaria vectors in this area.

AIM AND OBJECTIVE: Mosquitoes can transmit many types of viruses such as West
Nile virus and Zika virus and are responsible for a number of virus-causing
diseases including malaria, dengue fever, yellow fever, lymphatic filariasis, and
Japanese B encephalitis. On January 19, 2016, the first case of Zika virus
infection was identified in Taiwan, which presents the need for studying the
mosquito species in the Taiwan Strait and evaluating the risk of the outbreak of 
this infection.
MATERIALS AND METHOD: In this study, we have collected 144 mosquito specimens
from 42 species belonging to nine genera from both sides of the Taiwan Strait
during 2013 and 2014. We then applied the COI DNA Barcoding technique to classify
the specimens and performed a phylogenetic analysis to infer the evolutionary
history of these mosquitoes. Based on the analyses, we found that though the
mosquitoes from different sides of the Taiwan Strait share a lot of commonality, 
they have a few regional specificities.
RESULTS: Our results also suggested a very small divergences (1%~9%) between
specimens from the same mosquito species and relatively large divergences
(8%~25%) between specimens from different mosquito species. Within the same
species, the divergence of specimens from the same region is significantly
smaller than that between two regions. A few highly divergent species between
Fujian and Taiwan (e.g., An.maculatus and Ae.elsiae) might be formed due to the
so-called "cryptic evolutionary events", in which the species has differentiation
into cryptic species due to geographical differences without changing
morphological characteristics.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the phylogenetic analyses showed a very similar
taxonomy to the historical one based on morphological characteristics, validating
again the application of COI DNA Barcoding technique in classifying mosquito
species. However, there are also some inconsistencies between COI DNA Barcoding
and historical taxonomy, which points out the differences between mosquito DNA
and morphological characteristics and suggests the possibility to improve
mosquito taxonomy based on DNA techniques.

[The effect of leptin transgenic Plasmodium yoelii on mouse body weight].

[Article in Chinese]

Li K, Zheng H, Zhu F, Fu Y, Xu WY.

Objective: To investigate the effect of leptin transgenic Plasmodium yoelii on
mouse body weight.
Methods: To construct the leptin gene-containing CRISPR/Cas9 recombinant plasmid 
which had the 5′UTR and 3′UTR of MIF(macrophage migration inhibitory factor) of
Plasmodium yoelli 17XNL strain at two ends, the exogenous mouse leptin gene was
inserted downstream of MIF coding region through homologous recombination,
resulting in the PYC-MIF-Leptin recombinant plasmid. The recombinant plasmid was 
then electroporated into P. y 17XNL mature schizonts, and the transgenic
schizonts were used to infect a Kunming mouse via tail vein injection. The
trangenic P. y clone was screened by pyrimethamine selection and identified by
PCR. The trangenic or wild-type P. y was used to infect a C57BL/6 mouse
respectively. Blood sample was collected through eye ball and tail vein, and
immunofluorescence and RT-PCR were performed to determine the expression of
leptin protein in the parasites. Finally, PBS (200 μl) containing trangenic or
wild-type P. y (1 × 104) was injected through the tail vein into C57BL/6 mice(n =
5 respectively). The negative control received a same volume of PBS. The changes 
of parasitemia and body weight were recorded every two days.
Results: The leptin-expressing recombinant plasmid PYC-MIF-Leptin was constructed
successfully. Results of DNA sequencing of transgenic parasites confirmed the
integration of leptin gene at the downstream of MIF gene and successful
transcription. Immunofluorescence results indicated successful expression of
mouse leptin protein. The weight loss was significant in mice infected with
transgenic parasites on day 17(17.26 ± 1.40)g, decreased by 10.7%, but not in the
other two groups. Both transgenic and wild-type parasites began to decline when
parasitemia reached about 10%, but the transgenic parasites proliferated more
rapidly. Both disappeared at 23 days.
Conclusion: Infection with leptin transgenic parasites decreases the body weight 
of the infected mice.

Plasmodium ovale is widely distributed in tropical countries, whereas it has not 
been reported in the Americas. It is not a problem globally because it is rarely 
detected by microscopy owing to low parasite density, which is a feature of
clinical ovale malaria. P.o. curtisi and P.o. wallikeri are widespread in both
Africa and Asia, and were known to be sympatric in many African countries and in 
southeast Asian countries. Small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSUrRNA) gene, cytochrome
b (cytb) gene, and merozoite surface protein-1 (msp-1) gene were initially
studied for molecular discrimination of P.o. curtisi and P.o. wallikeri using
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing. DNA sequences of other genes 
from P. ovale in Southeast Asia and the southwestern Pacific regions were also
targeted to differentiate the two sympatric types. In terms of clinical
manifestations, P.o. wallikeri tended to produce higher parasitemia levels and
more severe symptoms. To date, there have been a few studies that used the
quantitative PCR method for discrimination of the two distinct P. ovale types.
Conventional PCR with consequent DNA sequencing is the common method used to
differentiate these two types. It is necessary to identify these two types
because relapse periodicity, drug susceptibility, and mosquito species preference
need to be studied to reduce ovale malaria. In this article, an easier method of 
molecular-level discrimination of P.o. curtisi and P.o. wallikeri is proposed.

BACKGROUND: North-east region of India has consistent role in the spread of multi
drug resistant Plasmodium (P.) falciparum to other parts of Southeast Asia. After
rapid clinical treatment failure of Artemisinin based combination
therapy-Sulphadoxine/Pyrimethamine (ACT-SP) chemoprophylaxis,
Artemether-Lumefantrine (ACT-AL) combination therapy was introduced in the year
2012 in this region for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. In 
a DNA sequencing based polymorphism analysis, seven codons of P. falciparum
dihydropteroate synthetase (Pfdhps) gene were screened in a total of 127 P.
falciparum isolates collected from Assam, Arunachal Pradesh and Tripura of
North-east India during the year 2014 and 2015 to document current sulfadoxine
resistant haplotypes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sequences were analyzed to rearrange both nucleotide and
protein haplotypes. Molecular diversity indices were analyzed in DNA Sequence
Polymorphism software (DnaSP) on the basis of Pfdhps gene sequences.
Disappearance from selective neutrality was assessed based on the ratio of
non-synonomous to synonomous nucleotide substitutions [dN/dS ratio]. Moreover,
two-tailed Z test was performed in search of the significance for probability of 
rejecting null hypothesis of strict neutrality [dN = dS]. Presence of mutant P.
falciparum multidrug resistance protein1 (Pfmdr1) was also checked in those
isolates that were present with new Pfdhps haplotypes. Phylogenetic relationship 
based on Pfdhps gene was reconstructed in Molecular Evolutionary Genetics
Analysis (MEGA).
RESULTS: Among eight different sulfadoxine resistant haplotypes found, IS GNG A
haplotype was documented in a total of five isolates from Tripura with
association of a new mutant M538 R allele. Sequence analysis of Pfmdr1 gene in
these five isolates came to notice that not all but only one isolate was mutant
at codon 86 (N86 Y ; Y YSND) in the multidrug resistance protein. Molecular
diversity based on Pfdhps haplotypes revealed that P. falciparum populations in
Assam and Tripura were under balancing selection for sulfadoxine resistant
haplotypes but population from Arunachal Pradesh was under positive selection
with comparatively high haplotype diversity (h = 0.870). In reconstructed
phylogenetic analysis, isolates having IS GNG A haplotype were grouped into two
separate sub-clusters from the other isolates based on their genetic distances
and diversities.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that sulfadoxine resistant isolates are still
migrating from its epicenter to the other parts of Southeast Asia and hence
control and elimination of the drug resistant isolates have become impedimental. 
Moreover, P. falciparum populations in different areas may undergo selection of
particular sulfadoxine resistant haplotypes either in the presence of drug or
after its removal to maintain their plasticity.

The significant strides made in reducing global malaria burden over the past
decades are being threatened by the emergence of multi-drug resistant malaria.
Mechanisms of resistance to several classes of antimalarial drugs have been
linked to key mutations in the Plasmodium falciparum genes. Pyrimethamine targets
the dihydrofolate reductase of the bifunctional dihydrofolate reductase
thymidylate synthase (DHFR-TS), and specific point mutations in the dhfr-ts gene 
have been assigned to resistant phenotypes. Several molecular methods are
available to detect the mutant genotypes including DNA sequencing and PCR-based
methods. In this study, we report the development of PfSNP-LAMP to detect
nucleotide polymorphism in the dhfr gene associated with N51I mutation and
antifolate resistance. The PfSNP-LAMP method was validated with genomic DNA
samples and parasite lysates prepared from sensitive and pyrimethamine resistant 
strains of P. falciparum.

Chloroquine (CQ) and fansidar (sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine, SP) were widely used
for treatment of Plasmodium falciparum for several decades in Malaysia prior to
the introduction of Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy (ACT) in 2008. Our
previous study in Kalabakan, located in south-east coast of Sabah showed a high
prevalence of resistance to CQ and SP, suggesting the use of the treatment may no
longer be effective in the area. This study aimed to provide a baseline data of
antimalarial drug resistant markers on P. falciparum isolates in Kota Marudu
located in the north-east coast of Sabah. Mutations on genes associated with CQ
(pfcrt and pfmdr1) and SP (pfdhps and pfdhfr) were assessed by PCR amplification 
and restriction fragment length polymorphism. Mutations on the kelch13 marker
(K13) associated with artemisinin resistance were determined by DNA sequencing
technique. The assessment of pfmdr1 copy number variation associated with
mefloquine resistant was done by real-time PCR technique. A low prevalence (6.9%)
was indicated for both pfcrt K76T and pfmdr1 N86Y mutations. All P. falciparum
isolates harboured the pfdhps A437G mutation. Prevalence of pfdhfr gene
mutations, S108N and I164L, were 100% and 10.3%, respectively. Combining the
different resistant markers, only two isolates were conferred to have CQ and SP
treatment failure markers as they contained mutant alleles of pfcrt and pfmdr1
together with quintuple pfdhps/pfdhfr mutation (combination of pfdhps A437G+A581G
and pfdhfr C59R+S108N+I164L). All P. falciparum isolates carried single copy
number of pfmdr1 and wild type K13 marker. This study has demonstrated a low
prevalence of CQ and SP resistance alleles in the study area. Continuous
monitoring of antimalarial drug efficacy is warranted and the findings provide
information for policy makers in ensuring a proper malaria control.

BACKGROUND: Malaria elicits inflammatory responses, which, if not well regulated,
may exert detrimental effects. When activated, triggering receptor expressed on
myeloid cells 1 (TREM-1) enhances inflammatory responses by increasing secretion 
of IL-8 and other Th1 cytokines. In contrast, TREM-like transcript 1 (TREML-1)
promotes anti-inflammatory responses by binding to TREM-1 ligands and competing
with TREM-1, thus antagonizing TREM-1 activation to reduce inflammation.
Endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) also mediates anti-inflammatory responses
by activating endothelial protein C (PC). Upon microbial stimulation, soluble
forms of TREM-1 (sTREM-1) and soluble EPCR (sEPCR) are released. Their plasma
levels reflect the degree of inflammation and the severity of infection.
METHODS: In a cross-sectional study comparing patients with severe with
uncomplicated malaria, sTREM-1, soluble TREML-1 (sTREML-1) and sEPCR plasma
levels as well as plasma levels of sEPCR derived from convalescent patients were 
quantified. Samples were collected on admittance of paediatric patients infected 
with Plasmodium falciparum to hospitals in Accra, Ghana. Distinct genetic regions
of the genes encoding TREM-1, EPCR, interleukin (IL)-8 and IL-18 encompassing
known genetic polymorphisms that influence plasma levels underwent DNA
sequencing.
RESULTS: Higher sTREM-1 levels were observed among children suffering from severe
malaria compared to those with uncomplicated malaria (P = 0.049). Low TREM-1 to
TREML-1 ratios were associated with uncomplicated malaria (P = 0.033). The TREM1 
rs2234237T variant causing the amino acid exchange Thr25Ser, which has been
associated with higher TREM-1 plasma levels, was significantly more frequent
among patients with severe malaria than in those with uncomplicated malaria (P = 
0.036). Low levels of sEPCR were observed in severe and uncomplicated malaria,
while variant genotypes of IL8, IL18 and EPCR did not show any association.
CONCLUSION: Higher plasma levels of sTREM-1 alone or relative to sTREML-1 during 
malaria predispose to the phenotype of severe malaria. Carriage of the TREM1
rs2234237T allele appears to be a risk factor for the development of severe
malaria.

BACKGROUND: An effective malaria vaccine is an urgently needed tool to fight
against human malaria, the most deadly parasitic disease of humans. One promising
candidate is the merozoite surface protein-3 (MSP-3) of Plasmodium falciparum.
This antigenic protein, encoded by the merozoite surface protein (msp-3) gene, is
polymorphic and classified according to size into the two allelic types of K1 and
3D7. A recent study revealed that both the K1 and 3D7 alleles co-circulated
within P. falciparum populations in Thailand, but the extent of the sequence
diversity and variation within each allelic type remains largely unknown.
METHODS: The msp-3 gene was sequenced from 59 P. falciparum samples collected
from five endemic areas (Mae Hong Son, Kanchanaburi, Ranong, Trat and Ubon
Ratchathani) in Thailand and analysed for nucleotide sequence diversity,
haplotype diversity and deduced amino acid sequence diversity. The gene was also 
subject to population genetic analysis (F st ) and neutrality tests (Tajima's D, 
Fu and Li D* and Fu and Li' F* tests) to determine any signature of selection.
RESULTS: The sequence analyses revealed eight unique DNA haplotypes and seven
amino acid sequence variants, with a haplotype and nucleotide diversity of 0.828 
and 0.049, respectively. Neutrality tests indicated that the polymorphism
detected in the alanine heptad repeat region of MSP-3 was maintained by positive 
diversifying selection, suggesting its role as a potential target of protective
immune responses and supporting its role as a vaccine candidate. Comparison of
MSP-3 variants among parasite populations in Thailand, India and Nigeria also
inferred a close genetic relationship between P. falciparum populations in Asia.
CONCLUSION: This study revealed the extent of the msp-3 gene diversity in P.
falciparum in Thailand, providing the fundamental basis for the better design of 
future blood stage malaria vaccines against P. falciparum.

Malaria transmission along international borders of the Greater Mekong Subregion 
is a big challenge for regional malaria elimination. At the Thai-Myanmar border, 
Plasmodium falciparum cases have dropped dramatically; however, increasing P.
vivax prevalence and the emerging reports on hidden malaria burden due to
asymptomatic infections demand attention. We conducted cross-sectional surveys to
detect asymptomatic malaria infections in a small village located at Thai-Myanmar
border and genotyped P. vivax infections in order to understand the level of
genetic diversity on such a microgeographic scale. PCR/RFLP and DNA sequencing
identified high levels of genetic polymorphisms at both Pvmsp3α and Pvmsp3β loci 
among P. vivax infections. Combining the PCR/RFLP patterns of Pvmsp3α and
Pvmsp3β, a total of 10 genotypes were observed among 17 samples, while
concatenated DNA sequences of Pvmsp3α and 3β generated 14 haplotypes with
haplotype diversity of 0.97. These markedly diverse parasites on a
microgeographic scale suggest the circulation of a considerably large parasite
population at the international border.

BACKGROUND: Health clinics in rural Africa are typically resource-limited. As a
result, many patients presenting with fever are treated with anti-malarial drugs 
based only on clinical presentation. This is a considerable issue in Uganda,
where malaria is routinely over-diagnosed and over-treated, constituting a
wastage of resources and an elevated risk of mortality in wrongly diagnosed
patients. However, rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for malaria are increasingly
being used in health facilities. Being fast, easy and inexpensive, RDTs offer the
opportunity for feasible diagnostic capacity in resource-limited areas. This
study evaluated the rate of malaria misdiagnosis and the accuracy of RDTs in
rural Uganda, where presumptive diagnosis still predominates. Specifically, the
diagnostic accuracy of "gold standard" methods, microscopy and PCR, were compared
to the most feasible method, RDTs.
METHODS: Patients presenting with fever at one of two health clinics in the
Kabarole District of Uganda were enrolled in this study. Blood was collected by
finger prick and used to administer RDTs, make blood smears for microscopy, and
blot Whatman FTA cards for DNA extraction, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
amplification, and sequencing. The accuracy of RDTs and microscopy were assessed 
relative to PCR, considered the new standard of malaria diagnosis.
RESULTS: A total of 78 patients were enrolled, and 31 were diagnosed with
Plasmodium infection by at least one method. Comparing diagnostic pairs
determined that RDTs and microscopy performed similarly, being 92.6 and 92.0 %
sensitive and 95.5 and 94.4 % specific, respectively. Combining both methods
resulted in a sensitivity of 96.0 % and specificity of 100 %. However, both RDTs 
and microscopy missed one case of non-falciparum malaria (Plasmodium malariae)
that was identified and characterized by PCR and sequencing. In total, based on
PCR, 62.0 % of patients would have been misdiagnosed with malaria if symptomatic 
diagnosis was used.
CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that diagnosis of malaria based on symptoms alone
appears to be highly inaccurate in this setting. Furthermore, RDTs were very
effective at diagnosing malaria, performing as well or better than microscopy.
However, only PCR and DNA sequencing detected non-P. falciparum species, which
highlights an important limitation of this test and a treatment concern for
non-falciparum malaria patients. Nevertheless, RDTs appear the only feasible
method in rural or resource-limited areas, and therefore offer the best way
forward in malaria management in endemic countries.

BACKGROUND: In Comoros, the widespread of chloroquine (CQ)-resistant Plasmodium
falciparum populations was a major obstacle to malaria control, which led to the 
official withdrawal of CQ in 2004. Continuous monitoring of CQ-resistant markers 
of the P. falciparum CQ resistant transporter (pfcrt) and the P. falciparum
multiple drug resistance 1 (pfmdr-1) is necessary inder to obtain first-hand
information on CQ susceptibility of parasite populations in the field. The
objective of this study is to assess the prevalence and evolution of
CQ-resistance in the P. falciparum populations on the Comoros' Grande Comore
island after withdrawal of CQ.
METHODS: A total of 207 P. falciparum clinical isolates were collected from the
island, including 118 samples from 2006 to 2007 and 89 samples from 2013 to 2014.
Nucleotide substitutions in the pfcrt and pfmdr-1 genes linked to CQ response in 
parasite isolates were assessed using nested PCR and DNA sequencing.
RESULTS: From the pfcrt gene segment sequenced, we detected C72S, M74I, N75E, and
K76T substitutions in the parasite isolates collected from both 2006-2007 to
2013-2014 periods. Significant decline of pfcrt resistant alleles at C72S (42.6
to 6.9 %), M74I (39.1 to 14.9 %), N75E (63.5 to 18.3 %), and K76T (72.2 to
19.5 %) from 2006-2007 to 2013-2014 were observed, and the frequency of pfcrt
wild type allele was significantly increased from 19.1 % in 2006-2007 to 75.8 %
in 2013-2014. Sequence analysis of pfmdr-1 also detected point mutations at
codons N86Y, Y184F, and D1246Y, but not S1034C and N1042D, in the isolates
collected from both examined periods. An increasing trend in the prevalence of
the pfmdr-1 wild type allele (NYD, 4.3 % in 2006-2007; and 28.7 % in 2013-2014), 
and a decreasing trend for pfmdr-1 N86Y mutation (87.0 % in 2006-2007; and 40.2 %
in 2013-2014) were observed in our samples.
CONCLUSIONS: The present data indicate that the prevalence and patterns of mutant
pfcrt and pfmdr-1 dramatically decreased in the Grande Comore isolates from 2006 
to 2014, suggesting that the CQ-sensitive P. falciparum strains have returned
after the withdrawal of CQ. The data also suggests that the parasites with wild
type pfcrt/pfdmr-1 genes may have growth and/or transmission advantages over the 
mutant parasites. The information obtained from this study will be useful for
developing and updating anti-malarial treatment policy in Grande Comore island.

Plasmodium knowlesi is now added to the known four Plasmodium species (P.vivax,
P.falciparum, P.malariae, P.ovale) as a cause of malaria in humans because of the
recent increasing rate of cases reported from countries of southeastern Asia.
P.knowlesi which infects macaque monkeys (Macaca fascicularis and M.nemestrina)
is transmitted to humans especially by Anopheles leucosphyrus and An.hackeri
mosquitos. First human cases of P.knowlesi malaria have been detected in Malaysia
which have reached high numbers in recent years and also have been reported from 
countries of Southeast Asia such as Thailand, Philippines, Myanmar, Singapore and
Vietnam. However the number of cases reported from western countries are rare and
limited only within voyagers. This report is the first presentation of an
imported case of P.knowlesi malaria in Turkey and aims to draw attention to the
point that it could also be detected in future. A 33-year-old male patient from
Myanmar who has migrated to Turkey as a refugee, was admitted to a health center 
with the complaints of fever with a periodicity of 24 hours, headache, fatigue,
cough, sore throat, anorexia, myalgia and arthralgia. He was prediagnosed as
upper respiratory tract infection, however because of his periodical fever and
background in Myanmar, thick and thin blood films were prepared and sent to our
laboratory for further examinations. Microscopic examination of the thin blood
films revealed erythrocytic stages compatible with P.knowlesi (three large early 
trophozoites in an erythrocyte, three late trophozoites with compact view, and
three late band-form trophozoites). Upon this, both real-time polymerase chain
reaction (Rt-PCR) targeting the small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU-rRNA) genes of
Plasmodium genus and DNA sequence analysis targeting P.knowlesi rRNA gene were
performed. As a result, the suspected identification of P.knowlesi by microscopy 
was confirmed by Rt-PCR and DNA sequencing. The patient was treated with
chloroquine and primaquine combination and in the follow-up on the seventh day
after the treatment, his parasitemia and symptoms had ceased. Although there were
some previous reports concerning about imported patients infected with different 
Plasmodium species in our country, no cases of P.knowlesi have been reported.
This first case presented here emphasizes the occurence of P.knowlesi malaria in 
Turkey hereinafter due to the increasing number of refugees.

Since 2005, artesunate (AS) plus sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (SP) combination has
been adopted as the first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria in Yemen in
response to the high level of Plasmodium falciparum resistance to chloroquine
(CQ). Therefore, the aim of the present study was to determine the frequency
distribution of molecular markers associated with resistance to CQ and AS plus SP
combination among P. falciparum isolates from a malaria-endemic area in Taiz
governorate, Yemen. Fifty P. falciparum isolates were collected during a
cross-sectional study in Mawza district, Taiz, in the period from October 2013 to
April 2014. The isolates were investigated for drug resistance-associated
molecular markers in five genes, including P. falciparum CQ resistance
transporter (pfcrt) 76T and P. falciparum multidrug resistance 1 (pfmdr1) 86Y as 
markers of resistance to CQ, mutations in the Kelch 13 (K13) propeller domain for
resistance to AS, and P. falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (pfdhfr) and P.
falciparum dihydropteroate synthase (pfdhps) genes for resistance to SP. Nested
polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify target genes in DNA extracts of the
isolates followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism for detecting 76T
and 86Y mutations in pfcrt and pfmdr1, respectively, and by DNA sequencing for
detecting mutations in K13, pfdhfr and pfdhps. All the investigated isolates from
Mawza district were harboring the pfcrt 76T mutant and the pfmdr1 N86 wild-type
alleles. The pfdhfr 51I/108N double mutant allele was found in 2.2% (1/45) of the
isolates; however, no mutations were detected at codons 436, 437, 540, 581 and
613 of pfdhps. All P. falciparum isolates that were successfully sequenced (n=47)
showed the K13 Y493, R539, I543 and C580 wild-type alleles. In conclusion, the
pfcrt 76T mutant allele is fixed in the study area about six years after the
official withdrawal of CQ, possibly indicating its over-the-counter availability 
and continued use as a self-medication in the study area. However, the almost

BACKGROUND: Malaria is a major parasitic disease, affecting millions of people in
endemic areas. Plasmodium falciparum parasites are responsible for the most
severe cases and its resistance to anti-malarial drugs is notorious. This is a
possible obstacle to the effectiveness of intermittent preventive treatment (IPT)
based on sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) cures administrated to pregnant women
(IPTp) during their pregnancy. As this intervention is recommended in Angola
since 2006, it has assessed, in this country, the molecular profiles in P.
falciparum dhfr and dhps, two polymorphic genes associated to pyrimethamine and
sulfadoxine resistance, respectively.
METHODS: Blood samples from 52 falciparum patients were collected in Lubango,
Angola and pfdhfr and pfdhps polymorphisms were analysed using nested-PCR and DNA
sequencing.
RESULTS: In the pfdhfr gene, the 108N mutation was almost fixed (98 %), followed 
by 59R (63 %), 51I (46 %), 50R and 164L (2 %, respectively). No 16V/S mutations
were found. The most common double mutant genotype was CNRN (59 + 108; 46 %),
followed by CICN (51 + 108; 29 %) whereas IRN (51 + 59 + 108; 15 %), CNRNVL
(59 + 108 + 164; 2 %) and RICN (50 + 51 + 108; 2 %) triple mutant genotypes were 
detected. Investigations of the pfdhps gene showed that the 437G mutation was the
most prevalent (97 %). Only two and one samples disclosed the 540E (7 %) and the 
436A (3 %), respectively. Single mutant SGKAA (437; 86 %) was higher than SGEAA
(437 + 540; 7 %) or AGKAA (436 + 437; 3 %) double mutants genotypes. No
polymorphism was detected at codons 581G and 613T/S. Combining pfdhfr and pfdhps 
alleles two triple mutant haplotypes (double mutant in dhfr and single mutant in 
dhps) were observed: the ACICNVI/SGKAA in 14 (56 %) samples and the ACNRNVI/SGKAA
in five (20 %) samples. One quadruple mutant haplotype was detected
(ACIRNVI/SGKAA) in six (24 %) P. falciparum samples. No quintuple pfdhfr-pfdhps
mutant was noted.
CONCLUSION: pfdhfr and pfdhps gene mutations in isolates from Lubango are
suggestive of a low-grade SP resistance and IPT for pregnant women and infant
based on SP treatment could be effective. Routine molecular studies targeting
polymorphism in these two genes need to be routinely conducted at country level.

BACKGROUND: Anti-malarial drug resistance is a primary public health problem.
Haplotypes of pfcrt gene have been implicated to be molecular markers of
chloroquine (CQ) resistance. This study aims to explore the prevalence of
polymorphisms in pfcrt in Plasmodium falciparum-infected patients imported from
Africa in Henan province.
METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 502 patients who were infected with P.
falciparum returning from Africa in Henan province during 2012-2015. The single
nucleotide polymorphisms in pfcrt (codons 72-76) were assessed by nested PCR with
DNA sequencing and restriction digestion, the haplotype prevalences were also
determined.
RESULTS: Four haplotypes coding 72-76 of pfcrt were found including CVMNK (wild
type), CVIET (mutation type), CVIEK (mutation type), and CV M/I N/E/D/K K/T
(mixed type), with 61.95 % (311/502), 33.07 % (166/502), 0.20 % (1/502), and
4.78 % (24/502) prevalence, respectively. Except mixed type, CVIET and CVIEK were
the largest proportion of the mutant type in West Africa, accounting for 44.83 % 
(91/203), followed by East Africa (8/21, 38.10 %), North Africa (4/11, 36.36 %), 
Central Africa (36/135, 26.67 %), and South Africa (28/132, 21.21 %). There was
significant difference among the groups (χ(2) = 23.78, P < 0.05). Mixed type was 
the largest proportion in North Africa (9.09 %), followed by Central Africa
(6.67 %), East Africa (4.76 %), South Africa (4.55 %), and West Africa (3.45 %). 
There was no significant difference among the groups (χ(2) = 2.31, P > 0.05). The
position 72 and 73 of pfcrt showed predominance for the wild type with rates of
100 % (502/502).
CONCLUSIONS: This study identified four haplotypes of pfcrt in P.
falciparum-infected patients imported from Africa in Henan province. The
prevalence of mutations in the pfcrt was dropped comparing with other people's
researches. It establishes fundamental data for detection of P. falciparum CQR
with molecular markers for the imported P. falciparum in China, and it also
provides complementary information of CQR for the malaria endemic countries and
assesses the evolution of anti-malarial drug resistance.

BACKGROUND: Anopheles sinensis is one of the most abundant vectors of malaria and
other diseases in Asia. Vector control through the use of insecticides is the
front line control method of vector-borne diseases. Pyrethroids are the most
commonly used insecticides due to their low toxicity to vertebrates and low
repellency. However, the extensive use of insecticides has imposed strong
selection pressure on mosquito populations for resistance. High levels of
resistance to pyrethroid insecticides and various mutations and haplotypes in the
para sodium channel gene that confers knockdown resistance (kdr) have been
detected in An. sinensis. Despite the importance of kdr mutations in pyrethroid
resistance, the evolutionary origin of the kdr mutations is unknown. This study
aims to examine the evolutionary genetics of kdr mutations in relation to spatial
population genetic structure of An. sinensis.
METHODS: Adults or larvae of Anopheles sinensis were collected from various
geographic locations in China. DNA was extracted from individual mosquitoes. PCR 
amplification and DNA sequencing of the para-type sodium channel gene were
conducted to analyse kdr allele frequency distribution, kdr codon upstream and
downstream intron polymorphism, population genetic diversity and kdr codon
evolution. The mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase COI and COII genes were
amplified and sequenced to examine population variations, genetic
differentiation, spatial population structure, population expansion and gene flow
patterns.
RESULTS: Three non-synonymous mutations (L1014F, L1014C, and L1014S) were
detected at the kdr codon L1014 of para-type sodium channel gene. A patchy
distribution of kdr mutation allele frequencies from southern to central China
was found. Near fixation of kdr mutation was detected in populations from central
China, but no kdr mutations were found in populations from southwestern China.
More than eight independent mutation events were detected in the three kdr
alleles, and at least one of them evolved multiple times subsequent to their
first divergence. Based on sequence analysis of the mitochondrial COI and COII
genes, significant and large genetic differentiation was detected between
populations from southwestern China and central China. The patchy distribution of
kdr mutation frequencies is likely a consequence of geographic isolation in the
mosquito populations and the long-term insecticide selection.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicate multiple origins of the kdr
insecticide-resistant alleles in An. sinensis from southern and central China.
Local selection related to intense and prolonged use of insecticide for
agricultural purposes, as well as frequent migrations among populations are
likely the explanations for the patchy distribution of kdr mutations in China. On
the contrary, the lack of kdr mutations in Yunnan and Sichuan is likely a
consequence of genetic isolation and absence of strong selection pressure. The
present study compares the genetic patterns revealed by a functional gene with a 
neutral marker and demonstrates the combined impact of demographic and selection 
factors on population structure.

OBJECTIVE: The present study aims to find out the mutational prevalence of
Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (Pfcrt) gene in Assam
and Arunachal Pradesh, India.
METHODS: To fulfil the objective of the study, a total of 54 P. falciparum
malaria positive samples were attempted for genotyping of Pfcrt gene using
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct DNA sequencing method.
RESULTS: The K76T mutation was observed in 77.78% cases followed by M74I
(61.11%), N75E (61.11%) and C72S (16.67%). Triple mutant allele M74I+N75E+K76T
was found in 61.11% P. falciparum field isolates. Double mutant allele C72S+K76T 
was seen among 16.67% samples. Mutation studies have shown existence of three
different haplotypes of which two were associated with chloroquine resistance.
The haplotype CVIET was found preponderance and circulated in all four districts.
The other haplotype SVMNT was observed only in Karbi Anglong district of Assam.
Maximum haplotype diversity was also recorded from Karbi Anglong district of
Assam.
CONCLUSION: Our study has confirmed high prevalence of mutant Pfcrt genotypes
associated with chloroquine resistance in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh, India.

BACKGROUND: Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency causes acute
haemolytic anaemia triggered by oxidative drugs such as primaquine (PQ), used for
Plasmodium vivax malaria radical cure. However, in many endemic areas of vivax
malaria, patients are treated with PQ without any evaluation of their G6PD
status.
METHODS: G6PD deficiency and its genetic heterogeneity were evaluated in
northeastern and southeastern areas from Venezuela, Cajigal (Sucre state) and
Sifontes (Bolívar state) municipalities, respectively. Blood samples from 664
randomly recruited unrelated individuals were screened for G6PD activity by a
quantitative method. Mutation analysis for exons 4-8 of G6PD gen was performed on
DNA isolated from G6PD-deficient (G6PDd) subjects through PCR-RFLP and direct DNA
sequencing.
RESULTS: Quantitative biochemical characterization revealed that overall 24
(3.6%) subjects were G6PDd (average G6PD enzyme activity 4.5 ± 1.2 U/g Hb,
moderately deficient, class III), while DNA analysis showed one or two mutated
alleles in 19 of them (79.2%). The G6PD A-(202A/376G) variant was the only
detected in 17 (70.8%) individuals, 13 of them hemizygous males and four
heterozygous females. Two males carried only the 376A → G mutation. No other
mutation was found in the analysed exons.
CONCLUSIONS: The G6PDd prevalence was as low as that one shown by nearby
countries. This study contributes to the knowledge of the genetic background of
Venezuelan population, especially of those living in malaria-endemic areas.
Despite the high degree of genetic mixing described for Venezuelan population, a 
net predominance of the mild African G6PD A-(202A/376G) variant was observed
among G6PDd subjects, suggesting a significant flow of G6PD genes from Africa to 
Americas, almost certainly introduced through African and/or Spanish immigrants
during and after the colonization. The data suggest that 1:27 individuals of the 
studied population could be G6PDd and therefore at risk of haemolysis under
precipitating factors. Information about PQ effect on G6PDd individuals carrying 
mild variant is limited, but since the regimen of 45 mg weekly dose for
prevention of malaria relapse does not seem to be causing clinically significant 
haemolysis in people having the G6PD A-variant, a reasoned weighing of
risk-benefit for its use in Venezuela should be done, when implementing public
health strategies of control and elimination.

BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum malaria is a significant public health problem 
in Comoros, and artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) remains the first choice
for treating acute uncomplicated P. falciparum. The emergence and spread of
artemisinin-resistant P. falciparum in Southeast Asia, associated with mutations 
in K13-propeller gene, poses a potential threat to ACT efficacy. Detection of
mutations in the P. falciparum K13-propeller gene may provide the first-hand
information on changes in parasite susceptibility to artemisinin. The objective
of this study is to determinate the prevalence of mutant K13-propeller gene among
the P. falciparum isolates collected from Grande Comore Island, Union of Comoros,
where ACT has been in use since 2004.
METHODS: A total of 207 P. falciparum clinical isolates were collected from the
island during March 2006 and October 2007 (n = 118) and March 2013 and December
2014 (n = 89). All isolates were analysed for single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) and haplotypes in the K13-propeller gene using nested PCR and DNA
sequencing.
RESULTS: Only three 2006-2007 samples carried SNPs in the K13-propeller gene, one
having a synonymous (G538G) and the other having two non-synonymous (S477Y and
D584E) substitutions leading to two mutated haplotypes (2.2%, 2/95). Three
synonymous mutations (R471R, Y500Y, and G538G) (5.9%, 5/85) and 7 non-synonymous 
substitutions (21.2%, 18/85) with nine mutated haplotypes (18.8%, 16/85) were
found in isolates from 2013 to 2014. However, none of the polymorphisms
associated with artemisinin-resistance in Southeast Asia was detected from any of
the parasites examined.
CONCLUSION: This study showed increased K13-propeller gene diversity among P.
falciparum populations on the Island over the course of 8 years (2006-2014).
Nevertheless, none of the polymorphisms known to be associated with artemisinin
resistance in Asia was detected in the parasite populations examined. Our data
suggest that P. falciparum populations in Grande Comore are still effectively
susceptible to artemisinin. Our results provide insights into P. falciparum
populations regarding mutations in the gene associated with artemisinin
resistance and will be useful for developing and updating anti-malarial guidance 
in Comoros.

BACKGROUND: The quartan malaria parasite Plasmodium malariae is the widest spread
and best adapted human malaria parasite. The simian Plasmodium brasilianum causes
quartan fever in New World monkeys and resembles P. malariae morphologically.
Since the genetics of the two parasites are nearly identical, differing only in a
range of mutations expected within a species, it has long been speculated that
the two are the same. However, no naturally acquired infection with parasites
termed as P. brasilianum has been found in humans until now.
METHODS: We investigated malaria cases from remote Yanomami indigenous
communities of the Venezuelan Amazon and analyzed the genes coding for the
circumsporozoite protein (CSP) and the small subunit of ribosomes (18S) by
species-specific PCR and capillary based-DNA sequencing.
FINDINGS: Based on 18S rRNA gene sequencing, we identified 12 patients harboring 
malaria parasites which were 100% identical with P. brasilianum isolated from the
monkey, Alouatta seniculus. Translated amino acid sequences of the CS protein
gene showed identical immunodominant repeat units between quartan malaria
parasites isolated from both humans and monkeys.
INTERPRETATION: This study reports, for the first time, naturally acquired
infections in humans with parasites termed as P. brasilianum. We conclude that
quartan malaria parasites are easily exchanged between humans and monkeys in
Latin America. We hypothesize a lack of host specificity in mammalian hosts and
consider quartan malaria to be a true anthropozoonosis. Since the name P.
brasilianum suggests a malaria species distinct from P. malariae, we propose that
P. brasilianum should have a nomenclatorial revision in case further research
confirms our findings. The expansive reservoir of mammalian hosts discriminates

The rapid spread of antimalarial drug resistance in Plasmodium falciparum over
the past few decades has necessitated intensive monitoring of such resistance for
an effective malaria control strategy. P. falciparum dihydropteroate synthase
(Pfdhps) and P. falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (Pfdhfr) genes act as
molecular markers for resistance against the antimalarial drugs sulphadoxine and 
pyrimethamine, respectively. Resistance to pyrimethamine which is used as a
partner drug in artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) is associated with several 
mutations in the Pfdhfr gene, namely A16V, N51I, C59R, S108N/T and I164L.
Therefore, routine monitoring of Pfdhfr-drug-resistant alleles in a population
may help in effective drug resistance management. Allele-specific PCR (ASPCR) is 
one of the commonly used methods for molecular genotyping of these alleles. In
this study, we genotyped 55 samples of P. falciparum for allele discrimination at
four codons of Pfdhfr (N51, C59, S108 and I164) by ASPCR using published methods 
and by Sanger's DNA sequencing method. We found that the ASPCR identified a
significantly higher number of mutant alleles as compared to the DNA sequencing
method. Such discrepancies arise due to the non-specificity of some of the
allele-specific primer sets and due to the lack of sensitivity of Sanger's DNA
sequencing method to detect minor alleles present in multiple clone infections.
This study reveals the need of a highly specific and sensitive method for
genotyping and detecting minor drug-resistant alleles present in multiple clonal 
infections.

The prevalence of vector-borne parasites varies greatly across host species, and 
this heterogeneity has been used to relate infectious disease susceptibility to
host species traits. However, a few empirical studies have directly associated
vector-borne parasite prevalence with exposure to vectors across hosts. Here, we 
use DNA sequencing of blood meals to estimate utilization of different avian host
species by Culex mosquitoes, and relate utilization by these malaria vectors to
avian Plasmodium prevalence. We found that avian host species that are highly
utilized as hosts by avian malaria vectors are significantly more likely to have 
Plasmodium infections. However, the effect was not consistent among individual
Plasmodium taxa. Exposure to vector bites may therefore influence the relative
number of all avian Plasmodium infections among host species, while other
processes, such as parasite competition and host-parasite coevolution, delimit
the host distributions of individual Plasmodium species. We demonstrate that
links between avian malaria susceptibility and host traits can be conditioned by 
patterns of exposure to vectors. Linking vector utilization rates to host traits 
may be a key area of future research to understand mechanisms that produce
variation in the prevalence of vector-borne pathogens among host species.

BACKGROUND: Antimalarial drug resistance is a primary public health problem.
Haplotypes of pfcrt and pfmdr1 gene have been implicated to be molecular markers 
of chloroquine (CQ) resistance. This study aims to explore mutation distribution 
of Pfcrt and Pfmdr1 in Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea (EG).
METHODS: Blood samples were collected from different districts of Bioko. The
single nucleotide polymorphisms in Pfcrt (codons 72 to 76) and Pfmdr1 (codons 86,
130, 184, 1034, 1042, 1109 and 1246) were assessed by nested PCR with DNA
sequencing and haplotype prevalences were also determined.
RESULTS: Analysis of Pfcrt and Pfmdr1 mutations was successful in 151 and 157
samples respectively out of the 172 samples taken for this study. The mutations
of Pfcrt and Pfmdr1 were found in 98.67% and 89.81% isolates, respectively. The
Pfcrt 74-76, Pfmdr1 86, and Pfmdr1 184 were 92.05%, 50.32%, and 87.26% found
mostly of mutation type, respectively. Three haplotypes coding 72-76 of Pfcrt
were found including CVMNK, CVIET, and CVM/I N/E K/T, which accounted for 1.33%, 
92.05%, and 6.62%, respectively. No mutation in Pfmdr1-N1 codon at 130 and
Pfmdr1-N2 (S1034C, N1042D, V1109I, and D1246Y) was detected. The types coding 86 
and 184 in Pfmdr1 were found including NY, YY, NF, YF, NY/F and YY/F, which
accounted for 10.19%, 2.55%, 33.76%, 45.22%, 5.73% and 2.55%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: High prevalence of Pfcrt CVIET and Pfmdr1 86Y, 184F double mutations 
confirm high-level CQ resistance (CQR) and might suggest reduced susceptibility
of Plasmodium falciparum isolates to AQ in Bioko, EG. It establishes fundamental 
data for detection of P. falciparum CQR with molecular markers and will promotes 
the surveillance level of drug resistance in Bioko, EG.

In the erythrocytes, malaria parasite entry and infection is mediated through
complex membrane sorting and signaling processes. We investigated the effects of 
single-locus and multilocus interactions to test the hypothesis that the members 
of the GPCR family genes, adenosine A2a receptor (ADORA2A) and G-protein coupled 
receptor kinase5 (GRK5), may contribute to the pathogenesis of malaria caused by 
Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) independently or through complex interactions. In a
case-control study of adults, individuals affected by Pf malaria (complicated
n=168; uncomplicated n=282) and healthy controls (n=450) were tested for their
association to four known SNPs in GRK5 (rs2230345, rs2275036, rs4752307 and
rs11198918) and two in ADORA2A (rs9624472 and rs5751876) genes with malaria
susceptibility, using techniques of polymerase chain reaction-restriction
fragment length polymorphisms and direct DNA sequencing. Single-locus analysis
showed significant association of 2 SNPs; rs5751876 (OR=3.2(2.0-5.2); p=0.0006)
of ADORA2A and rs2230345 (OR=0.3(0.2-0.5); p=0.0006) of GRK5 with malaria. The
mean of the serum creatinine levels were significantly higher in patients with
variant GG (p=0.006) of rs9624472 in ADORA2A gene compared to AA and AG genotypes
in complicated Pf malaria cases, with the G allele also showing increased risk
for malaria (OR=1.3(1.1-1.6); p=0.017). Analyses of predicted haplotypes of the
two ADORA2A and the four GRK5 SNPs have identified the haplotypes that conferred 
risk as well as resistance to malaria with statistical significance. Molecular
docking analysis of evolutionary rs2230345 SNP indicated a stable activity of
GRK5 for the mutant allele compared to the wild type. Further, generalized
multifactor dimensionality reduction to test the contribution of individual
effects of the six polymorphisms and higher-order interactions to risk of
symptoms/clinical complications of malaria suggested a best six-locus model
showing statistical significance. The study provides evidence for the role of
ADORA2A and GRK5 that might influence the etiology of malaria infection.

BACKGROUND: Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency and
hemoglobinopathies were the inherited conditions found mostly in African.
However, few epidemiological data of these disorders was reported in Equatorial
Guinea (EQG). This study aimed to assess the prevalence and healthy effects of
G6PD deficiency and hemoglobinopathies among the people on malaria endemic Bioko 
Island, EQG.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood samples from 4,144 unrelated subjects were analyzed 
for G6PD deficiency by fluorescence spot test (FST), high-resolution melting
assay and PCR-DNA sequencing. In addition, 1,186 samples were randomly selected
from the 4,144 subjects for detection of hemoglobin S (HbS), HbC, and
α-thalassemia deletion by complete blood count, PCR-DNA sequencing and reverse
dot blot (RDB).
RESULTS: The prevalence of malaria and anemia was 12.6% (522/4,144) and 32.8%
(389/1,186), respectively. Overall, 8.7% subjects (359/4,144) were G6PD-deficient
by FST, including 9.0% (249/2,758) males and 7.9% (110/1,386) females. Among the 
359 G6PD-deficient individuals molecularly studied, the G6PD A- (G202A/A376G)
were detected in 356 cases (99.2%), G6PD Betica (T968C/A376G) in 3 cases. Among
the 1,186 subjects, 201 cases were HbS heterozygotes, 35 cases were HbC
heterozygotes, and 2 cases were HbCS double heterozygotes; 452 cases showed
heterozygous α-thalassemia 3.7 kb deletion (-α3.7 kb deletion) and 85 homozygous 
- α3.7 kb deletion. The overall allele frequencies were HbS 17.1% (203/1186);
HbC, 3.1% (37/1186); and -α3.7 kb deletion 52.4% (622/1186), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: High G6PD deficiency in this population indicate that diagnosis and 
management of G6PD deficiency is necessary on Bioko Island. Obligatory newborn
screening, prenatal screening and counseling for these genetic disorders,
especially HbS, are needed on the island.

Molecular Epidemiology of Plasmodium falciparum Malaria Outbreak, Tumbes, Peru,
2010-2012.

Tapia LL, Salas C, Gamboa D, Herrera Y, Edgel KA, Udhayakumar V, Lescano AG.

During 2010-2012, an outbreak of 210 cases of malaria occurred in Tumbes, in the 
northern coast of Peru, where no Plasmodium falciparum malaria case had been
reported since 2006. To identify the source of the parasite causing this
outbreak, we conducted a molecular epidemiology investigation. Microsatellite
typing showed an identical genotype in all 54 available isolates. This genotype
was also identical to that of parasites isolated in 2010 in the Loreto region of 
the Peruvian Amazon and closely related to clonet B, a parasite lineage
previously reported in the Amazon during 1998-2000. These findings are consistent
with travel history of index case-patients. DNA sequencing revealed mutations in 
the Pfdhfr, Pfdhps, Pfcrt, and Pfmdr1 loci, which are strongly associated with
resistance to chloroquine and sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine, and deletion of the
Pfhrp2 gene. These results highlight the need for timely molecular epidemiology
investigations to trace the parasite source during malaria reintroduction events.

BACKGROUND: Hainan Province is one of the most severe endemic regions with high
transmission of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax in China. However, the
incidence of P. falciparum and P. vivax has dropped dramatically since 2007 and a
national elimination malaria programme (NEMP) was launched after 2010. To better 
understand the genetic information on P. vivax population before elimination of
malaria in Hainan Province, the extent of genetic diversity of P. vivax isolates 
in Hainan Province was investigated using four polymorphic genetic markers,
including P. vivax merozoite surface proteins 1, 3α, and 3β (pvmsp-1, pvmsp-3α,
and pvmsp-3β) and circumsporozoite protein (pvcsp).
METHODS: Isolates of P. vivax (n = 27) from Hainan Province were collected from
2009 to 2010 and pvmsp-1 and pvcsp were analysed by DNA sequencing, respectively.
Using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism were
analysed in pvmsp-3α, and pvmsp-3β.
RESULTS: The DNA sequencing analysis on pvmsp1 revealed that there were three
allele types: Salvador-1 (Sal-1), Belem and recombinant (R) types. Among them,
Sal-1 type was a dominant strain with eight variant subtypes (88.9%), whereas R- 
(3.7%) and Belem-type strains (7.4%) had one variant subtypes, respectively. All 
the isolates carried pvcsp with VK210 type accounting for 85.2% (23/27 isolates) 
and VK247 type accounting for 14.8% (4/27). Only type A and type B alleles were
successfully amplified in pvmsp-3α gene, and a high level of polymorphism was
observed in pvmsp-3α. Considering pvmsp-3β gene, type A was the predominant type 
in 17 isolates (63%), whereas type B was dominant in only ten isolates (37%).
CONCLUSION: The present data indicate that there was high degree of genetic
diversity among P. vivax population in Hainan Province of China during the
pre-elimination stage of malaria, with 26 unique haplotypes observed among 27
samples.

BACKGROUND: Haemoparasites in feral pigeons have been studied in several
countries but no data are available from Italy. The aim of this work was to
evaluate the prevalence and diversity of Haemoproteus spp./Plasmodium spp. and
Leucocytozoon spp. in feral pigeons from northwest Italy, as well as the
association between infection and host age or sex.
METHODS: Feral pigeons were collected during a regional culling programme from
the Piedmont region (northwest Italy) and subjected to necropsy. Infections were 
detected from DNA extracted from the spleen following a nested PCR protocol. The 
association between sex or age and infection status was evaluated using the
chi-squared test for independence or Fisher's exact test.
RESULTS: Out of 51 animals, 15 were positive for Haemoproteus/Plasmodium spp. and
eight for Leucocytozoon spp., with a significant difference between
haemoparasites prevalence. There was no significant association between age or
sex and infection status. The coinfection with different haemoparasites was very 
significant (p < 0.01), showing a greater relative risk to be infected by a
second haemoparasite in birds already infected, in particular in male and in
adult pigeons. DNA sequencing of Leucocytozoon spp. showed six different lineages
in pigeons, and one of Haemoproteus and Plasmodium, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Blood parasites are continuously circulating around the world, and
the results presented in the paper suggest that cross infection of feral pigeons 
with haemoparasites typical of other migratory or nonmigratory bird species is
possible. Moreover, the geographical location of Italy along the main migratory
routes is a crucial factor to be considered for migratory birds, because they can
be affected by blood parasites detected in feral pigeons, and vice versa.

Avian malaria is one of the most common veterinary problems in Southeast Asia.
The standard molecular method for detection of the avian malaria parasite
involves the phenol-chloroform extraction of parasite genomic (g)DNA followed by 
the amplification of parasite gDNA using polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
However, the phenol-chloroform extraction method is time-consuming and requires
large amounts of samples and toxic organic solvents, thereby limiting its
applications for parasite detection in the field. This study aimed to compare the
performance of chelex-100 resin and phenol/chloroform extraction methods for the 
extraction of Plasmodium gallinaceum gDNA from whole avian blood that had been
dried on filter papers (a common field sampling method). The specificity and
sensitivity of PCR assays for P. gallinaceum cytochrome B (cytb) and cytochrome
oxidase subunit I (coxI) gene fragments (544 and 588bp, respectively) were
determined, and found to be more sensitive with gDNA extracted by the chelex-100 
resin method than with the phenol/chloroform method. These PCR assays were also
performed to detect P. gallinaceum in 29 blood samples dried on filter papers
from domestic chickens in a malaria endemic area, where the reliable
identification of seven field isolates of P. gallinaceum was obtained with an
accuracy of 100%. The analysis of cytb and coxI gene nucleotide sequences
revealed the existence of at least two genetically distinct populations of P.
gallinaceum in Thailand, both of which differed from the reference strain 8A of
P. gallinaceum. In conclusion, the chelex-100 resin extraction method is a simple
and sensitive method for isolating gDNA from whole avian blood dried on filter
paper. Genomic DNA extracted by the chelex method could subsequently be applied
for the PCR-based detection of P. gallinaceum and DNA sequencing. Our PCR assays 
provide a reliable diagnostic tool for molecular epidemiological studies of P.
gallinaceum infections in domestic chickens and wild birds.

METHODS: The DBL2 fragment was amplified by PCR and cloned into pET28a vector.
The recombinant pET28a-DBL2 plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) and
protein expression was induced by IPTG. The expressed product was purified by
Ni-NTA affinity chromatography, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting.
RESULTS: DBL2 gene fragment of Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein
MSPDBL2 (950 bp) was obtained by PCR. The recombinant pET28a-DBL2 plasmid was
identified by PCR, double enzyme digestion, and DNA sequencing. The recombinant
DBL2 protein was expressed in an inclusion body form with Mr 340,000 after being 
induced with IPTG. Moreover, the purified recombinant DBL2 protein was recognized
by sera from patients with falciparum malaria.
CONCLUSION: The recombinant pET28a-DBL2 plasmid has been constructed. The
purified rDBL2 protein shows adequate antigenicity.

BACKGROUND: Malaria is a vector borne-parasitic disease transmitted through the
bite of the infective female Anopheles mosquitoes. Five Plasmodium species have
been recognized by World Health Organization (WHO) as the causative agents of
human malaria. Generally, microscopic examination is the gold standard for
routine malaria diagnosis. However, molecular PCR assays in many cases have shown
improvement on the sensitivity and specificity over microscopic or other
immunochromatographic assays.
METHODS: The present study attempts to screen 207 suspected malaria samples from 
patients seeking treatment in clinics around Sabah state, Malaysia, using two
panels of multiplex PCRs, conventional PCR system (PlasmoNex™) and real-time PCR 
based on hydrolysis probe technology. Discordance results between two PCR assays 
were further confirmed by sequencing using 18S ssu rRNA species-specific primers.
RESULTS: Of the 207 malaria samples, Plasmodium knowlesi (73.4% vs 72.0%) was the
most prevalent species based on two PCR assays, followed by Plasmodium falciparum
(15.9% vs 17.9%), and Plasmodium vivax (9.7% vs 7.7%), respectively. Neither
Plasmodium malariae nor Plasmodium ovale was detected in this study. Nine
discrepant species identification based on both the PCR assays were further
confirmed through DNA sequencing. Species-specific real-time PCR only accurately 
diagnosed 198 of 207 (95.7%) malaria samples up to species level in contrast to
PlasmoNex™ assay which had 100% sensitivity and specificity based on sequencing
results.
CONCLUSIONS: Multiplex PCR accelerate the speed in the diagnosis of malaria. The 
PlasmoNex™ PCR assay seems to be more accurate than real-time PCR in the
speciation of all five human malaria parasites. The present study also showed a
significant increase of the potential fatal P. knowlesi infection in Sabah state 
as revealed by molecular PCR assays.

Molecular detection of Plasmodium in free-ranging birds and captive flamingos
(Phoenicopterus chilensis) in Chicago.

Thurber MI, Gamble KC, Krebs B, Goldberg TL.

Frozen blood samples from 13 species of free-ranging birds (n = 65) and captive
Chilean flamingos (Phoenicopterus chilensis) (n = 46) housed outdoors in the
Chicago area were screened for Plasmodium. With the use of a modified polymerase 
chain reaction, 20/65 (30.8%) of free-ranging birds and 26/46 (56.5%) of
flamingos were classified as positive for this parasite genus. DNA sequencing of 
the parasite cytochrome b gene in positive samples demonstrated that eight
species of free-ranging birds were infected with five different Plasmodium spp.
cytochrome b lineages, and all positive Chilean flamingos were infected with
Plasmodium spp. cytochrome b lineages most closely related to organisms in the
Novyella subgenus. These results show that Chilean flamingos may harbor
subclinical malaria infections more frequently than previously estimated, and
that they may have increased susceptibility to some Plasmodium species.

BACKGROUND: Identification of the microflora of the sand fly gut and the
environmental distribution of these bacteria are important components for
paratransgenic control of Leishmania transmission by sand flies.
METHODS: Biotic and abiotic bacterial communities of four compartments of a
hyper-endemic focus of Zoonotic Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (ZCL) were investigated
using 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing and phylogenetic tree construction. These
compartments include Phlebotomus papatasi's gut, skin and intestinal tract of
great gerbil Rhombomys opimus, the gerbil nest supplies, and plant food sources
of the vectors and reservoirs.
RESULTS: Sequence homology analysis using nine available 16S rDNA data bases
revealed 40, 24, 15 and 14 aerobic bacterial species from the vector guts, the
gerbil bodies, the gerbil nests, and the plants, respectively. The isolated
bacteria belong to wide ranges including aerobic to facultative anaerobic,
pathogen to commensals, sand fly oviposition inducers, land to air and ocean
habitats, animal and human probiotics, and plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria. 
Matching data analysis suggested that the adult P. papatasi gut bacteria could be
acquired from three routes, adult sugar feeding on the plant saps, adult blood
feeding on the animal host, and larval feeding from nest supplies. However, our
laboratory experiment showed that none of the bacteria of the reservoir skin was 
transmitted to female sand fly guts via blood feeding. The microflora of sand fly
guts were associated with the sand fly environment in which the predominant
bacteria were Microbacterium, Pseudomonas, and Staphylococcus in human dwellings,
cattle farms, and rodent colonies, respectively. Staphylococcus aureus was the
most common bacterium in sand fly guts. Presence of some sand fly ovipoisition
inducers such Bacillus spp. and Staphylococcus saprophyticus support association 
between gut flora and oviposition induction.
CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study showed that Bacillus subtilis and Enterobacter
cloacae particularly subsp. dissolvens are circulated among the sand fly guts,
the plants, and the sand fly larval breeding places and hence are possible
candidates for a paratransgenic approach to reduce Leishmania transmission.

BACKGROUND: Plasmodium ovale is comprised of two genetically distinct subspecies,
P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri. Although P. ovale subspecies are similar
based on morphology and geographical distribution, allelic differences indicate
that P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri are genetically divergent.
Additionally, potential clinical and latency duration differences between P.
ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri demonstrate the need for investigation into 
the contribution of this neglected malaria parasite to the global malaria burden.
METHODS: In order to detect all P. ovale subspecies simultaneously, we developed 
an inclusive P. ovale-specific real-time PCR assay based on conserved regions
between P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri in the reticulocyte binding
protein 2 (rbp2) gene. Additionally, we characterized the P. ovale subspecies
prevalence from 22 asymptomatic malaria infections using multilocus genotyping to
discriminate P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri.
RESULTS: Our P. ovale rbp2 qPCR assay validation experiments demonstrated a
linear dynamic range from 6.25 rbp2 plasmid copies/microliter to 100,000 rbp2
plasmid copies/microliter and a limit of detection of 1.5 rbp2 plasmid
copies/microliter. Specificity experiments showed the ability of the rbp2 qPCR
assay to detect low-levels of P. ovale in the presence of additional malaria
parasite species, including P. falciparum, P. vivax, and P. malariae. We
identified P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri in Western Kenya by DNA
sequencing of the tryptophan-rich antigen gene, the small subunit ribosomal RNA
gene, and the rbp2 gene.
CONCLUSIONS: Our novel P. ovale rbp2 qPCR assay detects P. ovale curtisi and P.
ovale wallikeri simultaneously and can be utilized to characterize the
prevalence, distribution, and burden of P. ovale in malaria endemic regions.
Using multilocus genotyping, we also provided the first description of the
prevalence of P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri in Western Kenya, a region 
holoendemic for malaria transmission.

Antioxidant enzymes can contribute to disease susceptibility or determine
response to therapy in individuals with malaria. Genetic variations due to
polymorphisms in host genes encoding antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione
S-transferases-theta, mu, pi (GSTT, GSTM, GSTP), superoxide dismutases (SOD) and 
catalase (CAT), may therefore, influence inter-individual response to malaria
pathology and propensity of infection caused by Plasmodium vivax (Pv) and
Plasmodium falciparum (Pf). Therefore, using polymerase chain
reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and DNA sequencing, 
we investigated the association of deletions of GSTT1 and GSTM1, single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of GSTP1 (rs1695), SOD1 (rs2234694), SOD2
(rs4880, rs1141718), SOD3 (rs2536512) and CAT (rs1001179) in individuals infected
with Pf (n = 100) and Pv (n = 100) against healthy controls (n = 150). Our data
suggest a significant role for GSTM1 deletions in complicated Pv (p = 0.0007)
malaria with ODDs ratio 3.8 [with 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.9-7.4]. The
results also indicated that polymorphisms present in GSTP1, SOD1 and CAT genes
may be associated with malaria susceptibility (p < 0.05), whereas SOD3
polymorphism may play a role in malarial resistance (p < 0.05). In addition, we
observed significant SNP-SNP interactions with synergistic genetic effects in
SOD2, SOD3 and CAT genes for Pv and in SOD2 and SOD3 genes for Pf. In conclusion,
our results provide convincing evidence for a relationship between polymorphisms 
in host antioxidant enzymes and susceptibility to malaria infection.

[Construction of Plasmodium falciparum signal peptide peptidase-GFP mutant and
its expression analysis in the malaria parasite].

[Article in Chinese]

Li XR, Wu YJ, Shang M, Li Y, Xu J, Yu XB, Athar C.

OBJECTIVE: To construct recombinant plasmid pSPPcGT which contains signal peptide
peptidase gene of Plasmodium falciparum (PJSPP) and GFP, and transfect into P.
falciparum (3D7 strain) to obtain mutant parasites which can express PJSPP-GFP.
METHODS: Plasmodium falciparum(3D7 strain) genomic DNA was extracted from
cultured malaria parasites. The C-terminal region of PJSPP, an 883 bp gene
fragment was amplified by PCR, and then cloned into pPM2GT vector to get
recombinant vector pSPPcGT. The recombinant vectors were identified by PCR,
double restriction enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing. pSPPcGT vector was
transfected into malaria parasites. The positive clones were selected by adding
inhibitor of Plasmodium falciparum dihydrofolate reductase WR99210 to the culture
medium. The pSPP-GFP-transfected parasites were fixed with methanol, stained with
DAPI, and observed under immunofluorescence microscope. The PJSPP-GFP expression 
in P. falciparum was identified by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting.
RESULTS: The C-terminal region of PJSPP was amplified from P.falciparum (3D7
strain) genomic DNA by PCR with the length of 883 bp. The constructed recombinant
vectors were identified by PCR screening, double restriction enzyme digestion and
DNA sequencing. The pSPPcGT vector was transfected into P. falciparum and the
positive clones were selected by WR99210. GFP fluorescence was observed in
transfected parasites by immunofluorescence microscopy, and mainly located in the
cytoplasm. The PJSPP-GFP expression in malaria parasites was confirmed by Western
blotting with a relative molecular mass of Mr 64,000.
CONCLUSION: Recombinant vector PJSPP-GFP is constructed and transfected into P.
falciparum to obtain P. falciparum mutant clone which can express PfSPP-GFP.

BACKGROUND: Dengue fever is the commonest arthropod-borne infection worldwide. In
recent years, rapid growth in global air travel has resulted in a considerable
increase in the incidence of imported cases. In Romania it is now the second most
frequent cause for hospitalization (after malaria) in patients arriving from
tropical regions.
METHODS: Serological and molecular diagnostics were applied to samples obtained
between 2008 and 2013 from travelers with suspected dengue. Molecular typing was 
performed by RT-PCR followed by sequencing of the E-NS1 junction.
RESULTS: Twelve of 37 suspected cases were confirmed and three remained probable.
The infections were acquired in endemic regions in Asia, Africa and in Europe
(Madeira Island). Dengue virus nucleic acid was detected and sequenced in nine
cases. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the viruses were of genotypes I and V
of serotype 1, cosmopolitan genotype of serotype 2 and genotypes I and III of
serotype 3.
CONCLUSIONS: Romanian tourists traveling to dengue-endemic countries are at risk 
of acquiring dengue infection. Appropriate prevention measures prior to travel
and upon return should be taken, particularly as the dengue secondary vector
Aedes albopictus is now established in Bucharest.

The recent emergence and spread of artemisinin-resistant Plasmodium falciparum
isolates is a growing concern for global malaria-control efforts. A recent
genome-wide analysis study identified two SNPs at genomic positions MAL10-688956 
and MAL13-1718319, which are linked to delayed clearance of parasites following
artemisinin combination therapy (ACT). It is expected that continuous artemisinin
pressure will affect the distribution of these SNPs. Here, we investigate the
worldwide distribution of these SNPs using a large number of archived samples in 
order to generate baseline data from the period before the emergence of ACT
resistance. The presence of SNPs in MAL10-688956 and MAL13-1718319 was assessed
by nested PCR RFLP and direct DNA sequencing using 653 global P. falciparum
samples obtained before the reported emergence of ACT resistance. SNPs at
MAL10-688956 and MAL13-1718319 associated with delayed parasite clearance
following ACT administration were observed in 8% and 3% of parasites,
respectively, mostly in Cambodia and Thailand. Parasites harbouring both SNPs
were found in only eight (1%) isolates, all of which were from Cambodia and
Thailand. Linkage disequilibrium was detected between MAL10-688956 and
MAL13-1718319, suggesting that this SNP combination may have been selected by ACT
drug pressure. Neither of the SNPs associated with delayed parasite clearance
were observed in samples from Africa or South America. Baseline information of
the geographical difference of MAL10-688956 and MAL13-1718319 SNPs provides a
solid basis for assessing whether these SNPs are selected by artemisinin-based
combination therapies.

Utilization of multiple putatively neutral DNA markers for inferring evolutionary
history of species population is considered to be the most robust approach.
Molecular population genetic studies have been conducted in many species of
Anopheles genus, but studies based on single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data
are still very scarce. Anopheles minimus is one of the principal malaria vectors 
of Southeast (SE) Asia including the Northeastern (NE) India. Although population
genetic studies with mitochondrial genetic variation data have been utilized to
infer phylogeography of the SE Asian populations of this species, limited
information on the population structure and demography of Indian An. minimus is
available. We herewith have developed multilocus nuclear genetic approach with
SNP markers located in X chromosome of An. minimus in eight Indian and two SE
Asian population samples (121 individual mosquitoes in total) to infer population
history and test several hypotheses on the phylogeography of this species. While 
the Thai population sample of An. minimus presented the highest nucleotide
diversity, majority of the Indian samples were also fairly diverse. In general,
An. minimus populations were moderately substructured in the distribution range
covering SE Asia and NE India, largely falling under three distinct genetic
clusters. Moreover, demographic expansion events could be detected in the
majority of the presently studied populations of An. minimus. Additional DNA
sequencing of the mitochondrial COII region in a subset of the samples (40
individual mosquitoes) corroborated the existing hypothesis of Indian An. minimus
falling under the earlier reported mitochondrial lineage B.

OBJECTIVES: Polymorphisms in the lysosomal transporter encoded by the pfcrt gene 
directly impact on Plasmodium falciparum susceptibility to aminoquinolines. The
Lys76Thr mutation is the critical change conferring chloroquine resistance in
vitro and in vivo, but always occurs with additional non-synonymous changes in
the pfcrt coding sequence. We sought to better describe pfcrt polymorphisms
distal to codon 76.
METHODS: Small-volume samples (≤ 500 μL) of parasite-infected blood collected
directly from malaria patients presenting for treatment in Sudan and Tanzania
were immediately preserved for RNA extraction. The pfcrt locus was amplified from
cDNA preparations by nested PCR and sequenced directly to derive full-length mRNA
sequences.
RESULTS: In one of two sites in Sudan, two patients were found with an unorthodox
spliced form of pfcrt mRNA in which two exons were skipped, but it was not
possible to test for the presence of the putative protein products of these
aberrant transcripts. Genomic DNA sequencing from dried blood spots collected in 
parallel confirmed the presence of spliced pfcrt pseudogenes in a minority of
parasite isolates. Full-length cDNA from conventionally spliced mRNA molecules in
all study sites demonstrated the existence of a variety of pfcrt haplotypes in
East Africa, and thus provides evidence of intragenic recombination.
CONCLUSIONS: The presence of pseudogenes, although unlikely to have any direct
public health impact, may confound results obtained from simple genotyping
methods that consider only codon 76 and the adjacent residues of pfcrt.

BACKGROUND: Anopheles sinensis is one of the most important malaria vectors in
China and other Southeast Asian countries. High levels of resistance have been
reported in this species due to the long-term use of insecticides, especially
pyrethroids, for public health and agricultural purposes. Knockdown resistance
(kdr) caused by a single base pair mutation in the gene encoding the sodium
channel is strongly associated with pyrethroid insecticide resistance in many
Anopheles mosquitoes. There are few methods currently available for detecting kdr
mutations in An. sinensis.
METHODS: A novel AllGlo probe-based qPCR (AllGlo-qPCR) method was developed to
screen for the predominant kdr mutations in An. sinensis mosquitoes from the
Jiangsu Province. The results from AllGlo-qPCR, allele-specific PCR (AS-PCR), and
TaqMan-MGB probe-based qPCR (TaqMan-qPCR) were compared. A comparative analysis
of the equipment required, ease of use and cost of the available methods was also
performed. Finally, the AllGlo-qPCR method was used to detect the frequencies of 
kdr mutations from the other four provinces in central China.
RESULTS: Six kdr genotypes were detected in An. sinensis from the Jiangsu
Province by DNA sequencing. The AllGlo-qPCR method detected all of the kdr
genotypes with a high level of accuracy (97% sensitivity and 98% specificity).
AllGlo-qPCR correctly determined the kdr genotypes of 98.73% of 158 An. sinensis 
samples, whereas TaqMan-qPCR and AS-PCR correctly identified 96.84% and 88.61% of
mutations, respectively. Furthermore, the AllGlo-qPCR method is simpler to
perform, requires less equipment, and exhibits a moderate expense cost comparing 
with the other tested methods of kdr mutation detection. Samples collected from
four of the other provinces in central China showed a high frequency of kdr
mutation in An. sinensis, as detected by the established AllGlo-qPCR method.
CONCLUSION: The novel AllGlo-qPCR method developed for kdr mutation detection in 
An. sinensis exhibits greater specificity and sensitivity than currently
available methods and is more cost-effective; therefore, it represents a useful
tool for entomological surveillance.

vivax isolates from Yunnan and Anhui provinces of China.

BACKGROUND: Plasmodium vivax is the predominant species of human malaria
parasites present in China. Although sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) and
chloroquine (CQ) have been widely used for malaria treatment in China, the
resistance profiles of these drugs are not available. Analysis of dihydrofolate
reductase (dhfr), dihydropteroate synthase (dhps), and multidrug resistance
(mdr-1) gene mutations in P. vivax isolates is a valuable molecular approach for 
mapping resistance to SP and CQ. This study investigates the prevalence of
pvdhfr, pvdhps, and pvmdr-1 of P. vivax clinical isolates from China and provides
baseline molecular epidemiologic data on SP- and CQ-associated resistance in P.
vivax.
METHODS: Plasmodium vivax clinical isolates were collected from two
malaria-endemic regions of China, subtropical (Xishuangbanna, Yunnan province)
and temperate (Bozhou, Anhui province), from 2009 to 2012. All isolates were
analysed for single nucleotide polymorphism haplotypes in pvdhfr, pvdhps, and
pvmdr-1 using direct DNA sequencing.
RESULTS: In pvdhfr, 15% of Xishuangbanna isolates carried wild-type (WT) allele, 
whereas the majority of isolates carried mutant genes with substitutions at five 
codons. Eight mutant haplotypes of pvdhfr were detected, while limited
polymorphism of pvdhfr was found in Bozhou isolates. A size polymorphism was
present in pvdhfr, with the three-repeat type being the most predominate in both 
Xishuangbanna (79%) and Bozhou (97%) isolates. In pvdhps, mutations at four
codons were detected in Xishuangbanna isolates leading to six haplotypes,
including WT allele, single-mutation, double-mutation, and triple-mutation
alleles. All Bozhou isolates carried WT pvhdps. In pvmdr-1, isolates from
Xishuangbanna carried mutations at codons Y976F and F1076L, whereas all isolates 
from Bozhou had only a single mutation at codon F1076L.
CONCLUSIONS: Plasmodium vivax isolates from subtropical and temperate zones of
China are shown to have dramatically different frequencies and patterns of
mutations in pvdhfr, pvdhps, and pvmdr-1. Whereas P. vivax populations in
subtropical China are highly resistant to SP and CQ, those in the temperate zone 
may still be susceptible to SP and CQ. This information is useful for
establishing treatment policy and provides a baseline for molecular surveillance 
of drug-resistant P. vivax in these areas.

Molecular evidence of Plasmodium vivax mono and mixed malaria parasite infections
in Duffy-negative native Cameroonians.

Bioinformatics, National Institute of Malaria Research, Sector 8, Dwarka, New
Delhi, India.

The malaria parasite Plasmodium vivax is known to be majorly endemic to Asian and
Latin American countries with no or very few reports of Africans infected with
this parasite. Since the human Duffy antigens act as receptors for P. vivax to
invade human RBCs and Africans are generally Duffy-negative, non-endemicity of P.
vivax in Africa has been attributed to this fact. However, recent reports
describing P. vivax infections in Duffy-negative Africans from West and Central
parts of Africa have been surfaced including a recent report on P. vivax
infection in native Cameroonians. In order to know if Cameroonians living in the 
southern regions are also susceptible to P. vivax infection, we collected
finger-prick blood samples from 485 malarial symptomatic patients in five
locations and followed PCR diagnostic assays with DNA sequencing of the 18S
ribosomal RNA gene. Out of the 201 malaria positive cases detected, 193 were pure
P. falciparum, six pure P. vivax and two mixed parasite infections (P. falciparum
+ P. vivax). The eight P. vivax infected samples (six single + two mixed) were
further subjected to DNA sequencing of the P. vivax multidrug resistance 1
(pvmdr1) and the P.vivax circumsporozoite (pvcsp) genes. Alignment of the eight
Cameroonian pvmdr1 sequences with the reference sequence showed high sequence
similarities, reconfirming P. vivax infection in all the eight patients. DNA
sequencing of the pvcsp gene indicated all the eight P. vivax to be of VK247
type. Interestingly, DNA sequencing of a part of the human Duffy gene covering
the promoter region in the eight P. vivax-infected Cameroonians to identify the
T-33C mutation revealed all these patients as Duffy-negative. The results provide
evidence of single P. vivax as well as mixed malaria parasite infection in native
Cameroonians and add knowledge to the growing evidences of P. vivax infection in 
Duffy-negative Africans.

In combination with antibiotics, quinine is recommended as the second-line
treatment for uncomplicated malaria, an alternative first-line treatment for
severe malaria, and for treatment of malaria in the first trimester of pregnancy.
Quinine has been shown to have frequent clinical failures, and yet the mechanisms
of action and resistance have not been fully elucidated. However, resistance is
linked to polymorphisms in multiple genes, including multidrug resistance 1
(Pfmdr1), the chloroquine resistance transporter (Pfcrt), and the sodium/hydrogen
exchanger gene (Pfnhe1). Here, we investigated the association between in vitro
quinine susceptibility and genetic polymorphisms in Pfmdr1codons 86 and 184,
Pfcrt codon 76, and Pfnhe1 ms4760 in 88 field isolates from western Kenya. In
vitro activity was assessed based on the drug concentration that inhibited 50% of
parasite growth (the IC50), and parasite genetic polymorphisms were determined
from DNA sequencing. Data revealed there were significant associations between
polymorphism in Pfmdr1-86Y, Pfmdr1-184F, or Pfcrt-76T and quinine susceptibility 
(P < 0.0001 for all three associations). Eighty-two percent of parasites
resistant to quinine carried mutant alleles at these codons (Pfmdr1-86Y,
Pfmdr1-184F, and Pfcrt-76T), whereas 74% of parasites susceptible to quinine
carried the wild-type allele (Pfmdr1-N86, Pfmdr1-Y184, and Pfcrt-K76,
respectively). In addition, quinine IC50 values for parasites with Pfnhe1 ms4760 
3 DNNND repeats were significantly higher than for those with 1 or 2 repeats (P =
0.033 and P = 0.0043, respectively). Clinical efficacy studies are now required
to confirm the validity of these markers and the importance of parasite genetic
background.

Chloroquine (CQ) is used as a first-line therapy for the treatment of Plasmodium 
falciparum malaria in Nicaragua. We investigated the prevalence of molecular
markers associated with CQ and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) resistance in P.
falciparum isolates obtained from the North Atlantic Autonomous Region of
Nicaragua. Blood spots for this study were made available from a CQ and SP drug
efficacy trial conducted in 2005 and also from a surveillance study performed in 
2011. Polymorphisms in P. falciparum CQ resistance transporter, dihydrofolate
reductase, and dihydropteroate synthase gene loci that are associated with
resistance to CQ, pyrimethamine, and sulfadoxine, respectively, were detected by 
DNA sequencing. In the 2005 dataset, only 2 of 53 isolates had a CQ resistance
allele (CVIET), 2 of 52 had a pyrimethamine resistance allele, and 1 of 49 had a 
sulfadoxine resistance allele. In the 2011 dataset, none of 45 isolates analyzed 
had CQ or SP resistance alleles.

BACKGROUND: Malaria is one of the most important public health problems in
Southeast Asia, including Hainan Island, China. Vector control is the main
malaria control measure, and insecticide resistance is a major concern for the
effectiveness of chemical insecticide control programs. The objective of this
study is to determine the resistance status of the main malaria vector species to
pyrethroids and other insecticides recommended by the World Health Organization
(WHO) for indoor residual sprays.
METHODS: The larvae and pupae of Anopheles mosquitoes were sampled from multiple 
sites in Hainan Island, and five sites yielded sufficient mosquitoes for
insecticide susceptibility bioassays. Bioassays of female adult mosquitoes three 
days after emergence were conducted in the two most abundant species, Anopheles
sinensis and An. vagus, using three insecticides (0.05% deltamethrin, 4% DDT, and
5% malathion) and following the WHO standard tube assay procedure. P450
monooxygenase, glutathione S-transferase and carboxylesterase activities were
measured. Mutations at the knockdown resistance (kdr) gene and the ace-1 gene
were detected by DNA sequencing and PCR-RFLP analysis, respectively.
RESULTS: An. sinensis and An. vagus were the predominant Anopheles mosquito
species. An. sinensis was found to be resistant to DDT and deltamethrin. An.
vagus was susceptible to deltamethrin but resistant to DDT and malathion. Low kdr
mutation (L1014F) frequency (<10%) was detected in An. sinensis, but no kdr
mutation was detected in An. vagus populations. Modest to high (45%-75%) ace-1
mutation frequency was found in An. sinensis populations, but no ace-1 mutation
was detected in An. vagus populations. Significantly higher P450 monooxygenase
and carboxylesterase activities were detected in deltamethrin-resistant An.
sinensis, and significantly higher P450 monooxygenase, glutathione S-transferase 
and carboxylesterase activities were found in malathion-resistant An. vagus
mosquitoes.
CONCLUSIONS: Multiple insecticide resistance was found in An. sinensis and An.
vagus in Hainan Island, a malaria-endemic area of China. Cost-effective
integrated vector control programs that go beyond synthetic insecticides are
urgently needed.

BACKGROUND: Although the numbers of malaria cases in China have been declining in
recent years, outbreaks of Plasmodium vivax malaria were still being reported in 
rural areas south of the Yellow River. To better understand the transmission
dynamics of P. vivax parasites in China, the extent of genetic diversity of P.
vivax populations circulating in Bozhou of Anhui province of China were
investigated using three polymorphic genetic markers: merozoite surface proteins 
1 and 3α (pvmsp-1 and pvmsp-3α) and circumsporozoite protein (pvcsp).
METHODS: Forty-five P. vivax clinical isolates from Bouzhou of Anhui province
were collected from 2009 to 2010 and were analysed using PCR/RFLP or DNA
sequencing.
RESULTS: Seven and six distinct allelic variants were identified using PCR/RFLP
analysis of pvmsp-3α with HhaI and AluI, respectively. DNA sequence analysis of
pvmsp-1 (variable block 5) revealed that there were Sal-I and recombinant types
but not Belem type, and seven distinct allelic variants in pvmsp-1 were detected,
with recombinant subtype 2 (R2) being predominant (66.7%). All the isolates
carried pvcsp with VK210 type but not VK247 or P. vivax-like types in the
samples. Sequence analysis of pvcsp gene revealed 12 distinct allelic variants,
with VK210-1 being predominant (41.5%).
CONCLUSIONS: The present data indicate that there is some degree of genetic
diversity among P. vivax populations in Anhui province of China. The genetic data
obtained may assist in the surveillance of P. vivax infection in endemic areas or
in tracking potential future disease outbreak.

Nucleic acid testing (NAT) designate any molecular approach used for the
detection, identification, and characterization of pathogenic microorganisms,
enabling the rapid, specific, and sensitive diagnostic of infectious diseases,
such as tuberculosis. These assays have been widely used since the 90s of the
last century in human clinical laboratories and, subsequently, also in veterinary
diagnostics. Most NAT strategies are based in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
and its several enhancements and variations. From the conventional PCR, real-time
PCR and its combinations, isothermal DNA amplification, to the nanotechnologies, 
here we review how the NAT assays have been applied to decipher if and which
member of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex is present in a clinical sample.
Recent advances in DNA sequencing also brought new challenges and have made
possible to generate rapidly and at a low cost, large amounts of sequence data.
This revolution with the high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies makes
whole genome sequencing (WGS) and metagenomics the trendiest NAT strategies,
today. The ranking of NAT techniques in the field of clinical diagnostics is
rising, and we provide a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats)
analysis with our view of the use of molecular diagnostics for detecting
tuberculosis in veterinary laboratories, notwithstanding the gold standard being 
still the classical culture of the agent. The complementary use of both classical
and molecular diagnostics approaches is recommended to speed the diagnostic,
enabling a fast decision by competent authorities and rapid tackling of the
disease.

Piroplasmosis caused by different tick-borne hemoprotozoan parasites of the
genera Theileria and Babesia is among the most economically important infections 
of domestic ruminants in sub-Saharan Africa. A survey for piroplasm infection was
conducted in three locations in Northern Ethiopia. Of 525 domestic ruminants
surveyed, 80% of the cattle, 94% of the sheep and 2% of the goats were positive
for different Theileria spp. based on PCR of blood followed by DNA sequencing.
Sheep had a significantly higher rate of infection compared with cattle
(P<0.0003) and both sheep and cattle had higher rates of infection compared to
goats (P<0.0001). Four species of Theileria were detected in cattle: T. velifera,
T. mutans, T. orientalis complex and T. annulata with infection rates of 66, 8,
4, and 2%, respectively. This is the first report of T. annulata, the cause of
Tropical Theileriosis in Ethiopia. Of the two Theileria spp. detected in small
ruminants, T. ovis was highly prevalent (92%) in sheep and rare in goats (1.5%)
whereas T. seperata was infrequent in sheep (2%) and rare in goats (0.4%). None
of the animals were positive for Babesia spp.; however, Sarcocystis capracanis
and S. tenella were detected in one goat and a sheep, respectively. The
widespread distribution of Theileria spp. among cattle in northern Ethiopia
including the virulent T. annulata and more mildly pathogenic T. mutans and T.
orientalis, and the high infection rate in sheep with the usually sub-clinical T.
ovis indicate extensive exposure to ticks and transmission of piroplasms with an 
important economic impact.

BACKGROUND: The sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine (SDX/PYR) combination had been chosen 
to treat uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Malaysia for more than 30 years.
Non-silent mutations in dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) and dihydropteroate
synthase (dhps) genes are responsible for the resistance to pyrimethamine and
sulphadoxine, respectively. This study reports the mutational analysis of pfdhfr 
and pfdhps in single Plasmodium falciparum infection isolates from the interior
division of Sabah, Malaysian Borneo.
METHODS: A total of 22 P. falciparum single infection isolates collected from two
districts of the interior division of Sabah from February to November 2010 were
recruited for the mutational study of pfdhfr and pfdhps. Both genes were
amplified by nested PCR prior to DNA sequencing and mutational analysis.
RESULTS: A total of three pfdhfr and four pfdhps alleles were identified. The
most prevalent pfdhfr allele is ANRNL (86%) involving triple mutation at position
108(S to N), 59(C to R) and 164(I to L). In pfdhps, two novel alleles, SGTGA
(73%) and AAKAA (5%) were identified. Alleles involving triple mutation in both
pfdhfr (ANRNL) and pfdhps (SGTGA), which were absent in Sabah in a study
conducted about 15 years ago, are now prevalent.
CONCLUSIONS: High prevalence of mutations in SDX/PYR associated drug resistance
genes are reported in this study. This mutational study of pfdhps and pfdhfr
indicating that SDX/PYR should be discontinued in this region.

Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infections have declined in many industrialized
countries due to vaccination with the attenuated Oka strain virus. Rare cases of 
severe, disseminated vaccine-strain VZV infection have occurred in the
immunocompromised, although rarely in HIV-infected persons. We describe a man
with previously-undiagnosed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection who
received VZV vaccination and subsequently presented to a combat hospital in
Afghanistan with disseminated varicella, respiratory failure, and sepsis. The
patient recovered with ventilator and hemodynamic support, intravenous acyclovir,
and empiric antibiotic therapy. DNA sequencing detected Oka strain virus from
patient blood specimens. Although safe in most populations, the VZV vaccine may
cause life-threatening disease in immunocompromised patients. Improved detection 
of HIV infection may be useful in preventing such cases.

DNA samples derived from vertebrate skin, bodily cavities and body fluids contain
both host and microbial DNA; the latter often present as a minor component.
Consequently, DNA sequencing of a microbiome sample frequently yields reads
originating from the microbe(s) of interest, but with a vast excess of host
genome-derived reads. In this study, we used a methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD) to
separate methylated host DNA from microbial DNA based on differences in CpG
methylation density. MBD fused to the Fc region of a human antibody (MBD-Fc)
binds strongly to protein A paramagnetic beads, forming an effective one-step
enrichment complex that was used to remove human or fish host DNA from bacterial 
and protistan DNA for subsequent sequencing and analysis. We report enrichment of
DNA samples from human saliva, human blood, a mock malaria-infected blood sample 
and a black molly fish. When reads were mapped to reference genomes, sequence
reads aligning to host genomes decreased 50-fold, while bacterial and Plasmodium 
DNA sequences reads increased 8-11.5-fold. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index was
calculated for 149 bacterial species in saliva before and after enrichment.
Unenriched saliva had an index of 4.72, while the enriched sample had an index of
4.80. The similarity of these indices demonstrates that bacterial species
diversity and relative phylotype abundance remain conserved in enriched samples. 
Enrichment using the MBD-Fc method holds promise for targeted microbiome sequence
analysis across a broad range of sample types.

Prevalence of polymorphisms in antifolate drug resistance molecular marker genes 
pvdhfr and pvdhps in clinical isolates of Plasmodium vivax from Kolkata, India.

Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine has never been recommended for the treatment of
Plasmodium vivax malaria as the parasite is intrinsically resistant to
pyrimethamine. The combination was introduced as a promising agent to treat
Plasmodium falciparum malaria in many countries but was withdrawn after a few
years due to development and spread of resistant strains. Presently,
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine is used as a partner drug of artemisinin-based
combination therapy to treat uncomplicated falciparum malaria, and a combination 
of artesunate-sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine is currently in use in India. In
countries like India, where both P. vivax and P. falciparum are equally
prevalent, some proportion of P. vivax bacteria is exposed to
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine due to misdiagnosis and mixed infections. As reports on
the in vivo therapeutic efficacy of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine in P. vivax are
rare, the study of mutations in the marker genes P. vivax dhfr (pvdhfr) and
pvdhps is important for predicting drug selection pressure and
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance monitoring. We studied the prevalence of
point mutations and haplotypes of both the genes in 80 P. vivax isolates
collected from urban Kolkata, India, by the DNA sequencing method. Point mutation
rates in both the genes were low. The double mutant pvdhfr A15N50R58N117I173
(mutations are in boldface) and the single mutant pvdhps genotype
S382G383K512A553V585 were more prevalent, while 35% of the isolates harbored the 
wild-type genotype. The triple mutant ANRNI-SGKAV was found in 29.9% isolates. No
quintuple mutant genotype was recorded. The P. vivax parasites in urban Kolkata
may still be susceptible to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. Hence, a combination of
antimalarial drugs like artesunate-sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine introduced for P.
falciparum infection might be effective in P. vivax infection also. Study of the 
therapeutic efficacy of this combination in P. vivax is thus strongly suggested.

Occurrence of multiple chloroquine-resistant Pfcrt haplotypes and emergence of
the S(agt)VMNT type in Cameroonian Plasmodium falciparum.

Bioinformatics, National Institute of Malaria Research, Sector 8, Dwarka, New
Delhi 110077, India.

OBJECTIVES: The main objective of this study was to unravel the distribution of
different Pfcrt genotypes in the central, littoral, eastern and southern regions 
of Cameroon and also in locations bordering Gabon and Equatorial Guinea. This is 
because (i) the chloroquine-resistant malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum
shows a wide occurrence in Cameroon, (ii) mutations in the 72nd to 76th amino
acid positions of the Pfcrt gene are known to confer resistance to chloroquine,
and (iii) only a single chloroquine-resistant haplotype (C72V73I74E75T76) has so 
far been reported in Cameroon.
METHODS: We followed a molecular approach with DNA sequencing of the second exon 
of the Pfcrt gene to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms in 180 P.
falciparum field isolates sampled in five different locations in Cameroon.
RESULTS: The chloroquine-resistant Pfcrt CVIET haplotype was most abundant,
followed by the wild-type CVMNK haplotype. Five hitherto unreported
chloroquine-resistant Pfcrt haplotypes were detected for the first time in
Cameroonian P. falciparum, including the surprise appearance of the S(agt)VMNT
haplotype.
CONCLUSIONS: The high observed haplotype diversity of the chloroquine-resistant
Pfcrt gene and the appearance of the S(agt)VMNT haplotype are daunting and can be
attributed to drug pressure and/or the misuse of chloroquine and/or amodiaquine
in Cameroon.

susceptibility for Plasmodium falciparum malaria and asthma in an Indian
population.

The essential route to blood parasitaemia in malaria, erythrocyte invasion is
facilitated by activation of the G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathway
mediated by the β2-adrenoreceptor as one of the proteins on the surface of red
blood cells. The effectiveness of bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids in 
the clinical treatment for asthma patients also depend on polymorphisms in the
β2-adrenoreceptor gene (ADRB2). In a case control study, individuals affected by 
Plasmodium falciparum malaria, asthma and controls were tested for association of
six ADRB2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) viz. rs1042711, rs1801704,
rs1042713, rs1042714, rs1042717 and rs1042718, by direct DNA sequencing. The
rs1801704 locus was significantly associated with malaria when compared against
controls. The rs1042713 polymorphism was associated with forced expiratory flow
between 25% and 75% of the FVC in asthma patients, pre (p=0.048) and post
(p=0.038) treatment measurements. Predicted haplotype of the six SNPs computed
from genotype data showed T-T-A-C-G-C conferred significant risk of malaria
(p=0.02) whereas T-T-A-C-G-A was associated with risk of asthma (p=0.02). The
haplotype T-T-G-C-G-C was protective against both malaria (p=0.02) as well as
asthma (p=0.026) and C-C-G-G-G-C was protective uniquely for asthma (p=0.04). A
significant outcome was that all variant alleles at the SNP loci were part of the
haplotype conferring resistance to malaria disease and asthma, except rs1042713
and rs1042718 which showed very high frequency in asthma. The pairwise linkage
disequilibrium (LD) estimates showed a distinct LD block of all SNP loci (D'=1 or
>0.8) in malaria patients. This characteristic haplotype block was disrupted in
the controls due to non-significant pairwise LD of the SNP loci; and a more
extensive disruption of the block was noted in asthma patients. The study
provides evidence for the proposed role of β2-adrenoreceptor mediated molecular
mechanisms in etiology of malaria, as well as asthma disease and drug response,
for further clinical and therapeutic application studies.

BACKGROUND: High seroprevalence of parvovirus B19 (B19V) coinfection with
Plasmodium falciparum has been previously reported. However, the impact of
B19V-infection on the clinical course of malaria is still elusive. In this study,
we investigated the prevalence and clinical significance of B19V co-infection in 
Gabonese children with malaria.
METHODS: B19V prevalence was analyzed in serum samples of 197 Gabonese children
with P. falciparum malaria and 85 healthy controls using polymerase chain
reaction (PCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and direct
DNA-sequencing.
RESULTS: B19V was detected in 29/282 (10.28%) of Gabonese children. B19V was
observed more frequently in P. falciparum malaria patients (14.21%) in comparison
to healthy individuals (1.17%) (P<0.001). Notably, the mild-malaria group
revealed significantly lower hematocrit levels in B19V/P. falciparum co-infection
than in P. falciparum mono-infection (P<0.05). Genetic analysis revealed a
predominance of B19V genotype-1 (71.43%) in the studied population. However,
B19V-genotype 2 was observed significantly more often in children with
severe-malaria than in mild-malaria (P=0.04).
CONCLUSION: Our findings reveal that B19V-infection is frequent in Gabonese
children with P. falciparum malaria and signifies a possible contribution of B19V
on the clinical course of malaria in a genotype-dependent manner. B19V
co-infection should be considered as a additional diagnostic measure in malaria
patients with life threatening anemia.

Multilocus population genetic analysis of the Southwest Pacific malaria vector
Anopheles punctulatus.

The population structure and history of the cryptic malaria vector species,
Anopheles punctulatus (Doenitz), was investigated throughout Papua New Guinea and
the Solomon Islands with the aim of detailing genetic subdivisions and the
potential for movement through this biogeographically complex region. We obtained
larval collections from over 80 sites and utilised a diverse array of molecular
markers that evolve through different processes. Individuals were initially
identified to species and genotyped using the ribosomal DNA second internal
transcribed spacer. DNA sequencing of a single copy nuclear ribosomal protein S9 
and the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I loci were then investigated and 12
nuclear microsatellite markers were developed and analysed. Our data revealed
three genetically distinct populations--one in Papua New Guinea, the second on
Buka Island (Bougainville Province, Papua New Guinea), and the third on
Guadalcanal Island (Solomon Islands). Genetic differentiation within Papua New
Guinea was much lower than that found in studies of other closely related species
in the region. The data does suggest that A. punctulatus has undergone a
population bottleneck followed by a recent population and range expansion in
Papua New Guinea. Humans and regional economic growth may be facilitating this
population expansion, as A. punctulatus is able to rapidly occupy human modified 
landscapes and traverse unsealed roads. We therefore anticipate extensive
movement of this species through New Guinea--particularly into the highlands,
with a potential increase in malaria frequency in a warming climate--as well as
relatively unrestricted gene flow of advantageous alleles that may confound
vector control efforts.

This is the first case of Plasmodium knowlesi infection in a Japanese traveller
returning from Malaysia. In September 2012, a previously healthy 35-year-old
Japanese man presented to National Center for Global Health and Medicine in Tokyo
with a two-day history of daily fever, mild headaches and mild arthralgia.
Malaria parasites were found in the Giemsa-stained thin blood smear, which showed
band forms similar to Plasmodium malariae. Although a nested PCR showed the
amplification of the primer of Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium knowlesi, he was
finally diagnosed with P. knowlesi mono-infection by DNA sequencing. He was
treated with mefloquine, and recovered without any complications. DNA sequencing 
of the PCR products is indispensable to confirm P. knowlesi infection, however
there is limited access to DNA sequencing procedures in endemic areas. The extent
of P. knowlesi transmission in Asia has not been clearly defined. There is
limited availability of diagnostic tests and routine surveillance system for
reporting an accurate diagnosis in the Asian endemic regions. Thus, reporting
accurately diagnosed cases of P. knowlesi infection in travellers would be
important for assessing the true nature of this emerging human infection.

Haramaya University, PO Box 235, Harar, Ethiopia. tamiratgw2002@yahoo.com

BACKGROUND: This study was conducted to estimate the prevalence of Plasmodium
vivax and polymorphisms in the Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC) gene 
in patients with suspected malaria from eastern (Harar) and southwestern (Jimma) 
Ethiopia.
METHODS: Plasmodium presence and species was assessed by microscopy in 1304 and
627 febrile patients in Harar and Jimma, respectively, during October-November
2009. All microscopy-positive samples were confirmed by PCR. DARC gene
polymorphisms were identified by DNA sequencing.
RESULTS: Plasmodium vivax was the dominant species in Harar (74/98, 76%) and P.
falciparum was more common in Jimma (70/107, 65%). We found 17/98 (17%) and
24/107 (22%) homozygous Duffy-negative patients in Harar and Jimma, respectively.
Unexpectedly, three Duffy-negative patients from Harar had P. vivax malaria.
CONCLUSION: This study documents the emergence of P. vivax malaria in
Duffy-negative individuals in Ethiopia. The Duffy-negative blood group does not
appear to provide absolute protection against P. vivax infection in this region.

Rapid discrimination between Anopheles gambiae s.s. and Anopheles arabiensis by
High-Resolution Melt (HRM) analysis.

There is a need for more cost-effective options to more accurately discriminate
among members of the Anopheles gambiae complex, particularly An. gambiae and
Anopheles arabiensis. These species are morphologically indistinguishable in the 
adult stage, have overlapping distributions, but are behaviorally and
ecologically different, yet both are efficient vectors of malaria in equatorial
Africa. The method described here, High-Resolution Melt (HRM) analysis, takes
advantage of minute differences in DNA melting characteristics, depending on the 
number of incongruent single nucleotide polymorphisms in an intragenic spacer
region of the X-chromosome-based ribosomal DNA. The two species in question
differ by an average of 13 single-nucleotide polymorphisms giving widely
divergent melting curves. A real-time PCR system, Bio-Rad CFX96, was used in
combination with a dsDNA-specific dye, EvaGreen, to detect and measure the
melting properties of the amplicon generated from leg-extracted DNA of selected
mosquitoes. Results with seven individuals from pure colonies of known species,
as well as 10 field-captured individuals unambiguously identified by DNA
sequencing, demonstrated that the method provided a high level of accuracy. The
method was used to identify 86 field mosquitoes through the assignment of each to
the two common clusters with a high degree of certainty. Each cluster was defined
by individuals from pure colonies. HRM analysis is simpler to use than most other
methods and provides comparable or more accurate discrimination between the two
sibling species but requires a specialized melt-analysis instrument and software.

Asymptomatic infection by Plasmodium falciparum is an important obstacle to
eliminating malaria. Asymptomatic carriers do not seek treatment for infection,
and therefore they become a reservoir for the parasite. For this reason, these
carriers pose a real public health risk. The systematic identification and
treatment of asymptomatic infections should reduce the parasite reservoir. A
large reduction in this pool will lower the chance of transmission of the
disease. In this study, we screened a tribal population of 1,040 individuals in
the Purulia district of West Bengal by using a dual-antigen rapid diagnostic kit 
(RDK), microscopy, and species-specific PCR. All positive individuals were
treated with artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) (artesunate plus
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine) and followed for 42 days. Polymorphisms in candidate
genes were screened by DNA sequencing. A significant proportion (8.4%) of the
study population was infected with P. falciparum but showed no clinical
manifestations. The PCR method was more sensitive in detecting infection than the
RDK or microscopy. The efficacy of the ACT was 97%. In the pfcrt gene, the
mutation K76T (the mutated amino acid is indicated by bold type) was found in
100% of the cases. In the pfmdr1 gene, the mutations N86Y and Y184F were noted in
55.5% and 11% of the cases, respectively. Six different haplotypes were
identified in the pfdhfr-pfdhps genes. Most importantly, the quintuple mutant
A(16)I(51)R(59)N(108)I(164)-S(436)G(437)E(540)A(581)A(613) was found in 10% of
the isolates, which is potentially important for the development of
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance. A significant proportion of the study
population harboring P. falciparum does not seek treatment and therefore serves
as a reservoir for the parasite, maintaining the natural cycle. If the National
Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) of India is to eliminate malaria,
then this hidden parasite burden needs to be addressed properly. Similar study in
other parts of the country could help to determine the magnitude of the problem.

Plasmodium vivax malaria, though benign, has now become a matter of concern due
to recent reports of life-threatening severity and development of parasite
resistance to different antimalarial drugs. The magnitude of the problem is still
undetermined. The present study was undertaken to determine the in vivo efficacy 
of chloroquine (CQ) and chloroquine plus primaquine in P. vivax malaria in
Kolkata and polymorphisms in the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes. A total of 250
patients with P. vivax monoinfection were recruited and randomized into two
groups, A and B; treated with chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine,
respectively; and followed up for 42 days according to the WHO protocol of 2009. 
Data were analyzed using per-protocol analyses. We assessed polymorphisms of the 
pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes by a DNA-sequencing method. Out of the 250 patients
recruited, 204 completed a 42-day follow-up period, 101 in group A and 103 in
group B. In group A, the non-PCR-corrected efficacy of CQ was 99% (95% confidence
interval [CI], 0.944 to 1.00), and in group B, all cases were classified as
adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR). Day 3 positivity was
observed in 11 (5.3%) cases. No specific mutation pattern was recorded in the
pvcrt-o gene. Eight nonsynonymous mutations were found in the pvmdr1 gene, three 
of which were new. The Y976F mutation was not detected in any isolate.
Chloroquine, either alone or in combination with primaquine, is still effective
against P. vivax malaria in the study area. (The study protocol was registered in
CTRI [Clinical Trial Registry-India] of the Indian council of Medical Research
under registration no. CTRI/2011/09/002031.).

Toll like receptors (TLRs) play a pivotal role in recognizing the invading
malaria parasite Plasmodium, thus genetic makeup of the exposed population can be
of utmost importance for its predisposition to malaria. In this study 264 malaria
patients from seven different eco epidemiological regions of India were genotyped
for TLR2 and TLR4 polymorphisms using DNA sequencing methods. No variation was
observed at residue positions 677 and 753 in TLR2 whereas residue positions 299
and 399 in TLR4 were highly polymorphic. The GC haplotype (Asp299Gly/Thr399Thr)
was observed at the highest frequency in populations of East Singhbhum,
Vizianagaram and North Goa and absent in Kolkata, Dakshin Kannada and Nicobar
district. All polymorphisms were in Hardy Weinberg equilibrium. Populations of
Kolkata, Nicobar district, Sundergarh and Dakshin Kannada were observed to be
closely related. TLR2 polymorphism was absent in the Indian population and an
overall heterogeneous pattern of TLR4 polymorphism can be attributed to genetic
drift. However it can be inferred that GC haplotype is under the process of
natural selection in the Indian population and one of the factors contributing to
its selection could be predominance of Plasmodium falciparum in these regions.

OBJECTIVE: During an epidemiological study (January-July 2012) on malaria in
forest villages of Central India, Plasmodium malariae-like malaria parasites were
observed in blood smears of fever cases. We aimed to confirm the presence of P.
malariae using molecular tools i.e. species-specific nested polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing.
METHODS: All fever cases or cases with history of fever in 25 villages of
Balaghat district were screened for malaria parasite using bivalent rapid
diagnostic test and microscopy after obtaining written informed consent. Nested
PCR was employed on microscopically suspected P. malariae cases. DNA sequences in
the target region for PCR diagnosis were analysed for all the suspected cases of 
P. malariae.
RESULTS: Among the 22 microscopy suspected P. malariae cases, nested PCR
confirmed the identity of P. malariae in 19 cases. Among these 14 were mono P.
malariae infections, three were mixed infection of P. malariae with Plasmodium
falciparum and two were mixed infection of P. malariae with Plasmodium vivax.
Clinically P. malariae subjects generally presented with fever and headache.
However, the typical 3-day pattern of quantum malaria was not observed. The
parasite density of P. malariae was significantly lower than that of P. vivax and
P. falciparum.
DISCUSSIONS: Plasmodium malariae may have been in existence in forest villages of
central India but escaped identification due to its close resemblance to P.
vivax. The results re-affirm the importance of molecular methods of testing on
routine basis for efficacious control strategies against malaria.

BACKGROUND: Malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum infects roughly 30,000
individuals in Haiti each year. Haiti has used chloroquine (CQ) as a first-line
treatment for malaria for many years and as a result there are concerns that
malaria parasites may develop resistance to CQ over time. Therefore it is
important to prepare for alternative malaria treatment options should CQ
resistance develop. In many other malaria-endemic regions, antifolates,
particularly pyrimethamine (PYR) and sulphadoxine (SDX) treatment combination
(SP), have been used as an alternative when CQ resistance has developed. This
study evaluated mutations in the dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) and
dihydropteroate synthetase (dhps) genes that confer PYR and SDX resistance,
respectively, in P. falciparum to provide baseline data in Haiti. This study is
the first comprehensive study to examine PYR and SDX resistance genotypes in P.
falciparum in Haiti.
METHODS: DNA was extracted from dried blood spots and genotyped for PYR and SDX
resistance mutations in P. falciparum using PCR and DNA sequencing methods.
Sixty-one samples were genotyped for PYR resistance in codons 51, 59, 108 and 164
of the dhfr gene and 58 samples were genotyped for SDX resistance codons 436,
437, 540 of the dhps gene in P. falciparum.
RESULTS: Thirty-three percent (20/61) of the samples carried a mutation at codon 
108 (S108N) of the dhfr gene. No mutations in dhfr at codons 51, 59, 164 were
observed in any of the samples. In addition, no mutations were observed in dhps
at the three codons (436, 437, 540) examined. No significant difference was
observed between samples collected in urban vs rural sites (Welch's T-test
p-value = 0.53 and permutations p-value = 0.59).
CONCLUSION: This study has shown the presence of the S108N mutation in P.
falciparum that confers low-level PYR resistance in Haiti. However, the absence
of SDX resistance mutations suggests that SP resistance may not be present in
Haiti. These results have important implications for ongoing discussions on
alternative malaria treatment options in Haiti.

Development of multilocus putatively neutral DNA markers in the X-chromosome for 
population genetic studies in humans.

(1)Evolutionary Genomics and Bioinformatics Laboratory, Division of Genomics and 
Bioinformatics, National Institute of Malaria Research, Sector 8, Dwarka, New
Delhi - 110077, India.

BACKGROUND: It has now been well documented that the type (coding, non-coding)
and location (nuclear, mitochondrial etc.) of genetic markers heavily influence
evolutionary inferences; realistic assumptions can be drawn if multiple
putatively neutral DNA fragments spread across the genome are used.
AIM: To infer human population history, Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs),
located in the non-coding regions of different genes in the X-chromosome have
been developed as 'putatively neutral markers'.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A population sample consisting of 16 male individuals from 
the western part of India was utilized for sequencing eight DNA fragments located
in introns of three genes (Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Factor IX and Pyruvate
dehydrogenase E1 sub-unit) on the human X-chromosome. PCR amplification and DNA
sequencing confirmed the polymorphic status of all the fragments.
RESULTS: Twenty nine SNPs were found to be segregating in the Western Indian
population samples. Using these SNPs the nucleotide diversity and demographic
parameters of the Western Indian population were estimated. Several tests of
neutrality ascertained that all eight fragments evolve putatively neutrally.
Further, linkage disequilibrium analyses confirmed this fact.
CONCLUSION: All eight DNA fragments seem to bear the characteristics to be
considered as 'putatively neutral genetic markers' and thus, could be utilized
for inference of human population and demographic histories.

The Brazilian Amazon is a hypo-endemic malaria region with nearly 300,000 cases
each year. A variety of genetic polymorphisms, particularly in erythrocyte
receptors and immune response related genes, have been described to be associated
with susceptibility and resistance to malaria. In order to identify polymorphisms
that might be associated with malaria clinical outcomes in a Brazilian Amazonian 
population, sixty-four human single nucleotide polymorphisms in 37 genes were
analyzed using a Sequenom massARRAY iPLEX platform. A total of 648 individuals
from two malaria endemic areas were studied, including 535 malaria cases (113
individuals with clinical mild malaria, 122 individuals with asymptomatic
infection and 300 individuals with history of previous mild malaria) and 113
health controls with no history of malaria. The data revealed significant
associations (p<0.003) between one SNP in the IL10 gene (rs1800896) and one SNP
in the TLR4 gene (rs4986790) with reduced risk for clinical malaria, one SNP in
the IRF1 gene (rs2706384) with increased risk for clinical malaria, one SNP in
the LTA gene (rs909253) with protection from clinical malaria and one SNP in the 
TNF gene (RS1800750) associated with susceptibility to clinical malaria. Also, a 
new association was found between a SNP in the CTL4 gene (rs2242665), located at 
the major histocompatibility complex III region, and reduced risk for clinical
malaria. This study represents the first association study from an Amazonian
population involving a large number of host genetic polymorphisms with
susceptibility or resistance to Plasmodium infection and malaria outcomes.
Further studies should include a larger number of individuals, refined parameters
and a fine-scale map obtained through DNA sequencing to increase the knowledge of
the Amazonian population genetic diversity.

Mosquito bisection as a variable in estimates of PCR-derived malaria sporozoite
rates.

BACKGROUND: Highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods offer an
alternative to the light microscopy examination of mosquito salivary glands for
the determination of malaria sporozoite rates in wild caught female Anopheles.
Removal of mosquito abdomens is assumed to eliminate false positives caused by
malaria oocyst DNA in the midgut. This assumption has not been tested with
current gold standard PCR assays, and for the variety of conditions that
specimens could encounter in the laboratory and field.
METHODS: Laboratory Anopheles stephensi were used that had been infected with
Plasmodium falciparum 6-7 days and 14 days post infection (p.i.), when oocysts
only and oocysts + sporozoites, respectively, are developed. Mosquitoes were
killed and immediately frozen, air dried before being frozen, or stored under
humid conditions overnight before being frozen, to simulate a range of conditions
in the field. Additionally, abdomens were removed anterior to, at, or posterior
to the junction of the abdomen and thorax, and both portions were processed using
a standard nested PCR of the small sub-unit nuclear ribosomal genes (ssrDNA) with
products visualized on agarose gels.
RESULTS: Overall, 4.1 % (4/97) of head + thorax samples that were 6-7 days p.i.
gave apparent false positives for sporozoites, compared to 9.3 % (9/97) that were
positive for abdomens. No positives (0/52) were obtained when similar specimens
were bisected anterior to the junction of the thorax and abdomen, compared to
21.2 % (11/52) that were positive for posterior portions. Multiple bands were
noted for positives from the 'Frozen' treatment and the rate of false negatives
due to DNA degradation appears higher under the 'Humid' treatment.
Reproducibility of results for the 'Frozen' treatment was 90 %.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the importance of specimen condition and the bisection step 
in determining sporozoite rates, little attention has been paid to them in the
literature. Recommendations from this study are that: 1) care needs to be taken
to reduce DNA degradation in the field; 2) mosquito abdomens be separated
anterior to the junction of the thorax and abdomen; and 3) DNA sequencing of a
subsample of positive results should be undertaken if possible.

Evaluating the frequency of bacterial co-infections in children recruited into a 
malaria pathogenesis study in The Gambia, West Africa using molecular methods.

Systemic bacteraemia has been reported in children with severe Plasmodium
falciparum malaria in Sub Saharan Africa, making the identification or exclusion 
of concurrent infections a prerequisite for adequate treatment and studies of the
immune responses to particular infections. Given the overlap in clinical signs in
humans between malaria and, for example, pneumonia, the true cause of severe
illness is sometimes difficult to establish. Traditional microbiological culture 
methods employed to detect systemic bacteraemia are often time consuming and have
modest sensitivity. Therefore, molecular methods have become increasingly used in
the diagnosis of septicaemia. Here, we evaluated the usefulness of both
broad-range 16S rRNA PCR, in conjunction with DNA sequencing and species-specific
PCR targeting of Streptococcus pneumoniae and non-typhoidal Salmonella, to screen
for bacterial co-infections in blood samples from children enrolled in a malaria 
pathogenesis study. PCR revealed no test-positive results for these pathogens and
DNA sequencing of 16S rRNA amplicons identified the presence of bacterial genomic
DNA (most probably from environmental bacterial sources) in a large proportion of
samples. We demonstrate that the issue of potential mixed bacteraemic infection
and/or background bacterial genomic DNA, which may relate to co-migration of PCR 
amplicons on agarose gels, can be overcome by using denaturing gradient gel
electrophoresis (DGGE). PCR for Plasmodium spp. was also performed on genomic DNA
from bloods from Gambian children with pneumonia, in order to estimate the
prevalence of Plasmodium/pneumonia co-infections in the study population. While
12.2% of samples were test-positive, parasite density was very low and did not
vary significantly between cases and controls.

Fc gamma receptor (FcγR) provides an important link between humoral and cellular 
immune responses. FcγRIIa-H131R polymorphism has been associated with
differential binding to IgG subclasses and susceptibility to severe malaria
phenotypes among different populations in the malaria endemic world. In this
study, the effect of FCGR2A gene polymorphisms on susceptibility to symptomatic
malaria among Ghanaian cohort children was investigated. Blood samples from four 
hundred and 29 (429) healthy Ghanaian children were genotyped for FCGR2A
polymorphisms by direct DNA sequencing. Attributable and relative risks to
symptomatic malaria were calculated for the polymorphic variants. Two major
FCGR2A polymorphisms, rs1801274A/G (FcγRIIa-H131R) and rs150311303
(FcγRIIa-ins170L), were identified in the study population, and assessment of
their risks did not show significant association with susceptibility to
symptomatic malaria. The functional significance of these polymorphisms was also 
examined by evaluating their binding abilities to IgG subclasses using flow
cytometric analysis of HEK cells transfected with the FcγRIIa haplotype variants.
The binding assay revealed the rs150311303, which was observed only among
carriers of the FcγRIIa-131RR genotype for the rs1801274 to consistently enhance 
binding capacities to all IgG subclasses. Thus, of the three FcγRIIa haplotype
variants observed in this study population, the FcγRIIa(RL) haplotype variant was
observed to have the highest binding ability to IgG1, IgG3 and IgG4.

Possible association of the Plasmodium falciparum T1526C resa2 gene mutation with
severe malaria.

BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum exports proteins that remodel the erythrocyte
membrane. One such protein, called Pf155/RESA (RESA1) contributes to parasite
fitness, optimizing parasite survival during febrile episodes. Resa1 gene is a
member of a small family comprising three highly related genes. Preliminary
evidence led to a search for clues indicating the involvement of RESA2 protein in
the pathophysiology of malaria. In the present study, cDNA sequence of resa2 gene
was obtained from two different strains. The proportion of P. falciparum isolates
having a non-stop T1526C mutation in resa2 gene was evaluated and the association
of this genotype with severity of malaria was investigated.
METHODS: Resa2 cDNAs of two different strains (a patient isolate and K1 culture
adapted strain) was obtained by RT-PCR and DNA sequencing was performed to
confirm its gene structure. The proportion of isolates having a T1526C mutation
was evaluated using a PCR-RFLP methodology on groups of severe malaria and
uncomplicated patients recruited in 1991-1994 in Senegal and in 2009 in Benin.
RESULTS: A unique ORF with an internal translation stop was found in the patient 
isolate (Genbank access number : JN183870), while the K1 strain harboured the
T1526C mutation (Genbank access number : JN183869) which affects the internal
stop codon and restores a full length coding sequence. About 14% of isolates
obtained from Senegal and Benin harboured mutant T1526C parasites. Some isolates 
had both wild and mutant resa alleles. The analysis excluding those mixed
isolates showed that the resa2 T1526C mutation was found more frequently in
severe malaria cases than in uncomplicated cases (p = 0.008). The association of 
the presence of the mutant allele and parasitaemia >4% was shown in multivariate 
analysis (p = 0.03) in the group of Beninese children.
CONCLUSIONS: All T1526C mutant parasites theoretically have the ability to give
rise to a full-length RESA2 protein. This study raises the hypothesis that the
RESA2 protein could favour high-density infections. Other studies in various
geographic settings and probably including more patients are now required to
replicate these results and to answer the questions raised by these results.

Author information: 
(1)Regional Medical Research Centre for Tribals, Garha, Jabalpur 482003, Madhya
Pradesh, India.

BACKGROUND: Malaria continues to be a significant health problem in India.
Several of the intended Plasmodium falciparum vaccine candidate antigens are
highly polymorphic. The genetic diversity of P. falciparum merozoite surface
protein-1 (MSP-1) has been extensively studied from various parts of the world.
However, limited data are available from India. The aim of the present study was 
a molecular characterization of block 2 region of MSP-1 gene from the
tribal-dominated, forested region of Madhya Pradesh.
METHODS: DNA sequencing analysis was carried out in 71 field isolates collected
between July 2005 to November 2005 and in 98 field isolates collected from July
2009 to December 2009. Alleles identified by DNA sequencing were aligned with the
strain 3D7 and polymorphism analysis was done by using Edit Sequence tool
(DNASTAR).
RESULTS: The malaria positivity was 26% in 2005, which rose to 29% in 2009 and P.
falciparum prevalence was also increased from 72% in 2005 to 81% in 2009. The
overall allelic prevalence was higher in K1 (51%) followed by MAD20 (28%) and
RO33 (21%) in 2005 while in 2009, RO33 was highest (40%) followed by K1 (36%) and
MAD20 (24%).
CONCLUSIONS: The present study reports extensive genetic variations and dynamic
evolution of block 2 region of MSP-1 in central India. Characterization of
antigenic diversity in vaccine candidate antigens are valuable for future vaccine
trials as well as understanding the population dynamics of P. falciparum
parasites in this area.

In India, chloroquine has been replaced by a combination of artesunate and
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (AS-SP) for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. Other 
available combinations, artemether-lumefantrine (AM-LF) and artesunate-mefloquine
(AS-MQ), not included in the national program, are widely used by private
practitioners. Little is known about the therapeutic efficacy of these
artemisinin combinations and the prevalence of molecular markers associated with 
antimalarial drug resistance. A total of 157 patients with P. falciparum
monoinfection were recruited and randomized into three study groups (AS-SP,
AM-LF, and AS-MQ). All patients were followed up for 42 days to study the
clinical and parasitological responses according to the WHO protocol (2009). We
assessed the polymorphism of the pfATPase6, pfcrt, pfdhfr, and pfdhps genes by
the DNA-sequencing method. The PCR-corrected therapeutic efficacies of AS-SP,
AM-LF, and AS-MQ were 90.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.793 to 0.969), 95.9%
(95% CI, 0.860 to 0.995), and 100% (95% CI, 0.927 to 1.00), respectively. No
specific mutational pattern was observed in the pfATPase6 gene. All isolates had 
a K76T mutation in the pfcrt gene. In the pfdhfr-pfdhps genotype, quadruple
mutation was frequent, and quintuple mutation was documented in 6.3% of P.
falciparum isolates. The significant failure rate of AS-SP (9.5%), although
within the limit (10%) for drug policy change, was due to SP failure because of
prevailing mutations in pfdhfr, I(51)R(59)N(108), with pfdhps, G(437) and/or
E(540). The efficacy of this ACT needs periodic monitoring.
Artemether-lumefantrine and artesunate-mefloquine are effective alternatives to
the artesunate-sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine combination.

The effect of antimalarial drug selection on pfcrt and pfmdr1 polymorphisms in
Plasmodium falciparum isolates from two distinct geographical locations was
determined in 70 and 18 P. falciparum isolates from Nigeria and Brazil,
respectively, using nested polymerase chain reaction and direct DNA sequencing
approaches. All isolates from Brazil and 72% from Nigeria harbored the mutant
SVMNT and CVIET pfcrt haplotype, respectively. The pfcrt CVMNT haplotype was also
observed in (7%) of the Nigerian samples. One hundred percent (100%) and 54% of
the parasites from Brazil and Nigeria, respectively, harbored wild-type
pfmdr1Asn86. We provide first evidence of emergence of the CVMNT haplotype in
West Africa. The high prevalence of pfcrt CVIET and SVMNT haplotypes in Nigeria
and Brazil, respectively, is indicative of different selective pressure by
chloroquine and amodiaquine. Continuous monitoring of pfcrt SVMNT haplotype is
required in endemic areas of Africa, where artesunate-amodiaquine combination is 
used for treatment of acute uncomplicated malaria.

[Molecular genetic analysis of the X-chromosomal nuclear envelope attachment
region in nurse cells of the malaria mosquitoes Anopheles messeae Fall].

[Article in Russian]

Artemov GN, Stegniĭ VN.

DNA of the X-chromosomal nuclear envelope attachment region was isolated from
malaria mosquito Anopheles messeae Fall. nurse cells by chromosome
microdissection. A DNA library of the region was constructed using a plasmid
vector. DNA sequencing revealed gene fragments, tandem repeats, and a great
variety of transposable elements (TEs). The X-chromosomal nuclear envelope
attachment region was concluded to correspond in molecular organization and
cytogenetics to diffuse intercalary heterochromatin.

In vitro susceptibility to pyrimethamine of DHFR I164L single mutant Plasmodium
falciparum.

BACKGROUND: Recently, Plasmodium falciparum parasites bearing Pfdhfr I164L single
mutation were found in Madagascar. These new mutants may challenge the use of
antifolates for the intermittent preventive treatment of malaria during pregnancy
(IPTp). Assays with transgenic bacteria suggested that I164L parasites have a
wild-type phenotype for pyrimethamine but it had to be confirmed by testing the
parasites themselves.
METHODS: Thirty Plasmodium falciparum clinical isolates were collected in 2008 in
the south-east of Madagascar. A part of Pfdhfr gene encompassing codons 6 to 206 
was amplified by PCR and the determination of the presence of single nucleotide
polymorphisms was performed by DNA sequencing. The multiplicity of infection was 
estimated by using an allelic family-specific nested PCR. Isolates that appeared 
monoclonal were submitted to culture adaptation. Determination of IC(50s) to
pyrimethamine was performed on adapted isolates.
RESULTS: Four different Pfdhfr alleles were found: the 164L single mutant-type (N
= 13), the wild-type (N = 7), the triple mutant-type 51I/59R/108N (N = 9) and the
double mutant-type 108N/164L (N = 1). Eleven out 30 (36.7%) of P. falciparum
isolates were considered as monoclonal infection. Among them, five isolates were 
successfully adapted in culture and tested for pyrimethamine in vitro
susceptibility. The wild-type allele was the most susceptible with a 50%
inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) < 10 nM. The geometric mean of IC(50) of the
three I164L mutant isolates was 6-fold higher than the wild-type with 61.3 nM (SD
= 3.2 nM, CI95%: 53.9-69.7 nM). These values remained largely below the IC(50) of
the triple mutant parasite (13,804 nM).
CONCLUSION: The IC(50)s of the I164L mutant isolates were significantly higher
than those of the wild-type (6-fold higher) and close from those usually reported
for simple mutants S108N (roughly10-fold higher than wild type). Given the
observed values, the determination of IC(50)s directly on parasites did not
confirm what has been found on transgenic bacteria. The prevalence increase of
the Pfdhfr I164L single mutant parasite since 2006 could be explained by the
selective advantage of this allele under sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine pressure. The
emergence of highly resistant alleles should be considered in the future, in
particular because an unexpected double mutant-type allele S108N/I164L has been
already detected.

In Kenya, insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITNs) distributed to pregnant women 
and children under 5 years old through various programs have resulted in a
significant reduction in malaria deaths. All of the World Health
Organization-recommended insecticides for mosquito nets are pyrethroids, and
vector mosquito resistance to these insecticides is one of the major obstacles to
an effective malaria control program. Anopheles gambiae s.s. and Anopheles
arabiensis are major malaria vectors that are widely distributed in Kenya. Two
point mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel (L1014F and L1014S) are
associated with knockdown resistance (kdr) to DDT and pyrethroids in An. gambiae 
s.s. While the same point mutations have been reported to be rare in An.
arabiensis, some evidence of metabolic resistance has been reported in this
species. In order to determine the distribution of the point mutation L1014S in
An. gambiae s.s. and An. arabiensis in southern and western Kenya, we collected
larvae and screened for the mutation by DNA sequencing. We found high allelic and
homozygous frequencies of the L1014S mutation in An. gambiae s.s. The L1014S
mutation was also widely distributed in An. arabiensis, although the allelic
frequency was lower than in An. gambiae s.s. The same intron sequence (length: 57
base) found in both species indicated that the mutation was introgressed by
hybridization. The allelic frequency of L1014S was higher in both species in
western regions, demonstrating the strong selection pressure imposed by
long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLITN)/ITN on the An. gambiae s.s. and An.
arabiensis populations in those areas. The present contribution of the L1014S
mutation to pyrethroid resistance in An. arabiensis may be negligible. However,
the homozygous frequency could increase with continuing selection pressure due to
expanded LLITN coverage in the future.

Molecular markers for surveillance of Plasmodium falciparum resistance to current
antimalarials are sorely needed. A 28-day efficacy study of
artemether-lumefantrine in eastern Sudan identified 5 treatment failures among
100 evaluable patients; 9 further individuals were parasite positive by PCR
during follow-up. Polymorphisms in pfatpase6 and pfmdr1 were evaluated by DNA
sequencing. One individual carried parasites with a novel pfmdr1 polymorphism
(F1044L). pfmdr1 gene amplification in parasites prior to treatment occurred in
three individuals who had recurrent infection during follow-up.

Molecular markers of anti-malarial drug resistance in Lahj Governorate, Yemen:
baseline data and implications.

Medicine and Health Sciences, Aden University, Yemen. reemmubjer@yahoo.co.uk

BACKGROUND: This is an investigation of anti-malarial molecular markers coupled
with a therapeutic efficacy test of chloroquine (CQ) against falciparum malaria
in an area of unstable malaria in Lahj Governorate, Yemen. The study was aimed at
assessment of therapeutic response to CQ and elucidation of baseline information 
on molecular markers for Plasmodium falciparum resistance against CQ and
sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine (SP).
METHODS: Between 2002 and 2003 the field test was conducted according to the
standard WHO protocol to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of CQ in 124 patients 
with falciparum malaria in an endemic area in Lahj Governorate in Yemen. Blood
samples collected during this study were analysed for P. falciparum chloroquine
resistance transporter gene (pfcrt)-76 polymorphisms, mutation pfcrt-S163R and
the antifolate resistance-associated mutations dihydrofolate reductase
(dhfr)-C59R and dihydropteroate synthase (dhps)-K540E. Direct DNA sequencing of
the pfcrt gene from three representative field samples was carried out after DNA 
amplification of the 13 exons of the pfcrt gene.
RESULTS: Treatment failure was detected in 61% of the 122 cases that completed
the 14-day follow-up. The prevalence of mutant pfcrt T76 was 98% in 112 amplified
pre-treatment samples. The presence of pfcrt T76 was poorly predictive of in vivo
CQ resistance (PPV = 61.8%, 95% CI = 52.7-70.9). The prevalence of dhfr Arg-59
mutation in 99 amplified samples was 5%, while the dhps Glu-540 was not detected 
in any of 119 amplified samples. Sequencing the pfcrt gene confirmed that Yemeni 
CQ resistant P. falciparum carry the old world (Asian and African) CQ resistant
haplotype CVIETSESI at positions 72,73,74,75,76,220,271, 326 and 371.
CONCLUSION: This is the first study to report baseline information on the
characteristics and implications of anti-malarial drug resistance markers in
Yemen. It is also the first report of the haplotype associated with CQR P.
falciparum parasites from Yemen. Mutant pfcrtT76 is highly prevalent but it is a 
poor predictor of treatment failure in the study population. The prevalence of
mutation dhfrArg59 is suggestive of emerging resistance to SP, which is currently
a component of the recommended combination treatment of falciparum malaria in
Yemen. More studies on these markers are recommended for surveillance of
resistance in the study area.

Anopheles gambiae s.s., Anopheles arabiensis, and Anopheles funestus s.s. are the
most important species for malaria transmission. Pyrethroid resistance of these
vector mosquitoes is one of the main obstacles against effective vector control. 
The objective of the present study was to monitor the pyrethroid susceptibility
in the 3 major malaria vectors in a highly malaria endemic area in western Kenya 
and to elucidate the mechanisms of pyrethroid resistance in these species. Gembe 
East and West, Mbita Division, and 4 main western islands in the Suba district of
the Nyanza province in western Kenya were used as the study area. Larval and
adult collection and bioassay were conducted, as well as the detection of point
mutation in the voltage-gated sodium channel (1014L) by using direct DNA
sequencing. A high level of pyrethroid resistance caused by the high frequency of
point mutations (L1014S) was detected in An. gambiae s.s. In contrast,
P450-related pyrethroid resistance seemed to be widespread in both An. arabiensis
and An. funestus s.s. Not a single L1014S mutation was detected in these 2
species. A lack of cross-resistance between DDT and permethrin was also found in 
An. arabiensis and An. funestus s.s., while An. gambiae s.s. was resistant to
both insecticides. It is noteworthy that the above species in the same area are
found to be resistant to pyrethroids by their unique resistance mechanisms.
Furthermore, it is interesting that 2 different resistance mechanisms have
developed in the 2 sibling species in the same area individually. The cross
resistance between permethrin and DDT in An. gambiae s.s. may be attributed to
the high frequency of kdr mutation, which might be selected by the frequent
exposure to ITNs. Similarly, the metabolic pyrethroid resistance in An.
arabiensis and An. funestus s.s. is thought to develop without strong selection
by DDT.

Health and Human Services, Atlanta, Georgia 30329, USA.

Isoenzyme analysis of cultured parasites is the conventional approach for
Leishmania species identification. Molecular approaches have the potential to be 
more sensitive and rapid. We designed PCR generic primers to amplify a segment of
the rRNA internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) from multiple Leishmania species.
To validate the selected ITS2 fragment, we tested clinical specimens and compared
the species results obtained by the molecular approach (PCR followed by DNA
sequencing analysis) with those from the parasitologic approach (in vitro culture
followed by isoenzyme analysis). Among the 159 patients with clinical specimens
positive by both approaches, a total of eight Leishmania species were identified.
The species results were concordant for all but two patients: for one patient,
the results were Leishmania (Viannia) guyanensis by the molecular approach versus
L. (V.) braziliensis by the parasitologic approach; for the other patient, the
results were L. (Leishmania) tropica versus L. (L.) major, respectively. ITS2
PCR, followed by sequencing analysis, can be used to detect and discriminate
among Leishmania species. The results confirmed our hypothesis that a region of
the ITS2 gene can complement the characterization of Leishmania parasites at the 
species level. The approach we developed can be used as a diagnostic tool in
reference laboratories with adequate infrastructure to perform molecular
characterization of pathogens.

BACKGROUND: In 2005, Ghana replaced chloroquine with artemisinin-based
combination therapy as the first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria. The
aim of this work was to determine for the first time, polymorphisms in the
putative pfATPase6 and pftctp, pfmdr1, pfcrt genes in Ghanaian isolates,
particularly at a time when there is no report on artemisinin resistance in
malaria parasites from Ghana. The sensitivity of parasite isolates to
anti-malaria drugs were also evaluated for a possible association with
polymorphisms in these genes.
METHODS: The prevalence of point mutations in the above Plasmodium falciparum
genes were assessed from filter-paper blood blot samples by DNA sequencing. In
vitro drug sensitivity test was carried out on some of the blood samples from
volunteers visiting hospitals/clinics in southern Ghana using a modified version 
of the standard WHO Mark III micro-test.
RESULTS: All successfully tested parasite isolates were sensitive to artesunate; 
while 19.4%, 29.0% and 51.6% were resistant to quinine, amodiaquine and
chloroquine respectively. The geometric mean of IC50 value for artesunate was
0.73 nM (95% CI, 0.38-1.08), amodiaquine 30.69 nM (95% CI, 14.18-47.20) and
chloroquine 58.73 nM (95% CI, 38.08-79.38). Twenty point mutations were observed 
in pfATPase6 gene, with no L263E and S769N. All mutations found were low in
frequency, except D639G which was observed in about half of the isolates but was 
not associated with artesunate response (p = 0.42). The pftctp gene is highly
conserved as no mutation was observed, while CVIET which is chloroquine-resistant
genotype at codon 72-76 of the pfcrt gene was identified in about half of the
isolates; this was consistent with chloroquine IC50 values (p = 0.001). Mutations
were present in pfmdr1 gene but were not associated with artemisinin response (p 
= 1.00).
CONCLUSION: The pfATPase6 gene is highly polymorphic with D639G appearing to be
fixed in Ghanaian isolates. These may just be spontaneous mutations as all
parasite isolates that were tested displayed satisfactory in vitro response to
artesunate. However, there is no improvement in susceptibility of the parasites
to chloroquine five years after its proscription.

BACKGROUND: Knockdown resistance (kdr) in insects, resulting from mutation(s) in 
the voltage-gated sodium channel (vgsc) gene is one of the mechanisms of
resistance against DDT and pyrethroid-group of insecticides. The most common
mutation(s) associated with knockdown resistance in insects, including
anophelines, has been reported to be present at residue Leu1014 in the IIS6
transmembrane segment of the vgsc gene. This study reports the presence of two
alternative kdr-like mutations, L1014S and L1014F, at this residue in a major
malaria vector Anopheles stephensi and describes new PCR assays for their
detection.
METHODS: Part of the vgsc (IIS4-S5 linker-to-IIS6 transmembrane segment) of An.
stephensi collected from Alwar (Rajasthan, India) was PCR-amplified from genomic 
DNA, sequenced and analysed for the presence of deduced amino acid
substitution(s).
RESULTS: Analysis of DNA sequences revealed the presence of two alternative
non-synonymous point mutations at L1014 residue in the IIS6 transmembrane segment
of vgsc, i.e., T>C mutation on the second position and A>T mutation on the third 
position of the codon, leading to Leu (TTA)-to-Ser (TCA) and -Phe (TTT) amino
acid substitutions, respectively. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays were
developed for identification of each of these two point mutations. Genotyping of 
An. stephensi mosquitoes from Alwar by PCR assays revealed the presence of both
mutations, with a high frequency of L1014S. The PCR assays developed for
detection of the kdr mutations were specific as confirmed by DNA sequencing of
PCR-genotyped samples.
CONCLUSIONS: Two alternative kdr-like mutations, L1014S and L1014F, were detected
in An. stephensi with a high allelic frequency of L1014S. The occurrence of
L1014S is being reported for the first time in An. stephensi. Two specific PCR
assays were developed for detection of two kdr-like mutations in An. stephensi.

Intraerythrocytic malaria parasites can obtain nearly their entire amino acid
requirement by degrading host cell hemoglobin. The sole exception is isoleucine, 
which is not present in adult human hemoglobin and must be obtained exogenously. 
We evaluated two compounds for their potential to interfere with isoleucine
utilization. Mupirocin, a clinically used antibacterial, kills Plasmodium
falciparum parasites at nanomolar concentrations. Thiaisoleucine, an isoleucine
analog, also has antimalarial activity. To identify targets of the two compounds,
we selected parasites resistant to either mupirocin or thiaisoleucine. Mutants
were analyzed by genome-wide high-density tiling microarrays, DNA sequencing, and
copy number variation analysis. The genomes of three independent
mupirocin-resistant parasite clones had all acquired either amplifications
encompassing or SNPs within the chromosomally encoded organellar (apicoplast)
isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase. Thiaisoleucine-resistant parasites had a mutation in
the cytoplasmic isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase. The role of this mutation in
thiaisoleucine resistance was confirmed by allelic replacement. This approach is 
generally useful for elucidation of new targets in P. falciparum. Our study shows
that isoleucine utilization is an essential pathway that can be targeted for
antimalarial drug development.

Incomplete concerted evolution and reproductive isolation at the rDNA locus
uncovers nine cryptic species within Anopheles longirostris from Papua New
Guinea.

Technology, Sydney. Australia.

BACKGROUND: Nuclear ribosomal DNA (rDNA) genes and transcribed spacers are highly
utilized as taxonomic markers in metazoans despite the lack of a cohesive
understanding of their evolution. Here we follow the evolution of the rDNA second
internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) and the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome oxidase I
subunit in the malaria mosquito Anopheles longirostris from Papua New Guinea
(PNG). This morphospecies inhabits a variety of ecological environments
indicating that it may comprise a complex of morphologically indistinguishable
species. Using collections from over 70 sites in PNG, the mtDNA was assessed via 
direct DNA sequencing while the ITS2 was assessed at three levels - crude
sequence variation through restriction digest, intragenomic copy variant
organisation (homogenisation) through heteroduplex analysis and DNA sequencing
via cloning.
RESULTS: Genetic evaluation of over 300 individuals revealed that A. longirostris
comprises eight ITS2 PCR-RFLP genotypes and nine ITS2 heteroduplex genotypes
showing distinct copy variant organization profiles after PCR amplification.
Seven of these nine genotypes were found to be sympatric with other genotypes.
Phylogenetic analysis of cloned ITS2 PCR products and mtDNA COI confirmed all
nine clades with evidence of reproductive isolation at the rDNA locus.
Compensatory base changes in the ITS2 secondary structure or in pseudoknots were 
absent when closely related species were assessed. Individuals from each ITS2
genotype showed the same copy variant heteroduplex profile suggesting that the
rDNA array is fixed within each genotype.
CONCLUSION: The centromere-proximal position of the rDNA array in Anopheles
mosquitoes has probably reduced interchromosomal recombination leaving
intrachromosomal events responsible for the observed pattern of concerted
evolution we see in these mosquitoes. The stability of these intragenomic ITS2
copy variants within individuals and interbreeding populations suggests that rDNA
is moving as a single evolutionary unit through natural populations to fixation
and has provided a complementary diagnostic tool to the restriction digest for
studying genetic discontinuities and species boundaries. In this, the utility of 
the ITS2 as a universal taxonomic marker is probably contingent on several
factors pertaining to spacer dimensions and the genomic location of the rDNA
array with respect to recombination and proximity to regions potentially under
selection.

polymorphisms for artemisinin resistance before introduction of artemisinin-based
combination therapy.

Janeiro (RJ), Brazil.

BACKGROUND: This study was performed to better understand the genetic diversity
of known polymorphisms in pfatpase6 and pfmdr1 genes before the introduction of
ACT in Brazil, in order to get a genotypic snapshot of Plasmodium falciparum
parasites that may be used as baseline reference for future studies.
METHODS: Parasites from P. falciparum samples collected in 2002, 2004 and
2006-2007 were genotyped using PCR and DNA sequencing at codons 86, 130, 184,
1034, 1042, 1109 and 1246 for pfmdr1 gene, and 243, 263, 402, 431, 623, 630, 639,
683, 716, 776, 769 and 771 for pfatpase6 gene.
RESULTS: A pfmdr1 haplotype NEF/CDVY was found in 97% of the samples. In the case
of pfatpase6, four haplotypes, wild-type (37%), 630 S (35%), 402 V (5%) and
double-mutant 630 S + 402 V (23%), were detected.
CONCLUSION: Although some polymorphism in pfmdr1 and pfatpase6 were verified, no 
reported haplotypes in both genes that may mediate altered response to ACT was
detected before the introduction of this therapy in Brazil. Thus, the haplotypes 
herein described can be very useful as a baseline reference of P. falciparum
populations without ACT drug pressure.

Aotus and Saimiri are non-human primate models recommended by the World Health
Organization for experimental studies in malaria, especially for vaccine
pre-clinical trials. However, research using these primates is hindered by the
lack of specific reagents to evaluate immune responses to infection or
vaccination. As a step toward developing molecular tools for cytokine expression 
studies in these species, primer pairs for 18 cytokine gene fragments were
designed based on human DNA sequences and used to amplify the corresponding genes
in Aotus infulatus and Saimiri sciureus genomic DNA samples. IFNγ, TNFα, LTA,
IL2, IL3, IL4, IL5, IL6, IL10, IL12, IL13, CSF2 and TGFβ2 gene fragments were
amplified and sequenced. Primer pairs for IL8, IL17, IL18, IL27 and MIF failed to
generate amplification products. When compared to the available corresponding
human and non-human primate sequences, most--except IL3 and IL4--showed identity 
degrees above 90%. Small variations in sequence can help to explain the failure
to amplify certain genes or the amplification only at lower annealing
temperatures as compared to human DNA samples for several primer pairs. The
sequences made available provide the basis for designing molecular tools such as 
primers for real time PCR specific for A. infulatus and/or S. sciureus. The
nucleotide sequences reported in this paper have been submitted to the GenBank
nucleotide sequence database and have been assigned accession numbers DQ985386 to
DQ985389, DQ989356 to DQ989369, FJ89020 to FJ89024, and FJ89029.

High-throughput genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the Plasmodium
falciparum dhfr gene by asymmetric PCR and melt-curve analysis.

Mutations within the Plasmodium falciparum dihydrofolate reductase gene (Pfdhfr) 
contribute to resistance to antimalarials such as sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP).
Of particular importance are the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within
codons 51, 59, 108, and 164 in the Pfdhfr gene that are associated with SP
treatment failure. Given that traditional genotyping methods are time-consuming
and laborious, we developed an assay that provides the rapid, high-throughput
analysis of parasite DNA isolated from clinical samples. This assay is based on
asymmetric real-time PCR and melt-curve analysis (MCA) performed on the
LightCycler platform. Unlabeled probes specific to each SNP are included in the
reaction mixture and hybridize differentially to the mutant and wild-type
sequences within the amplicon, generating distinct melting curves. Since the
probe is present throughout PCR and MCA, the assay proceeds seamlessly with no
further addition of reagents. This assay was validated for analytical sensitivity
and specificity using plasmids, purified genomic DNA from reference strains, and 
parasite cultures. For all four SNPs, correct genotypes were identified with 100 
copies of the template. The performance of the assay was evaluated with a blind
panel of clinical isolates from travelers with low-level parasitemia. The
concordance between our assay and DNA sequencing ranged from 84 to 100% depending
on the SNP. We also directly compared our MCA assay to a published TaqMan
real-time PCR assay and identified major issues with the specificity of the
TaqMan probes. Our assay provides a number of technical improvements that
facilitate the high-throughput screening of patient samples to identify
SP-resistant malaria.

With a view to developing putatively neutral markers based on Single Nucleotide
Polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium vivax, we utilized
the published whole genome sequence information of P. falciparum and P. vivax to 
find a ~200 kb conserved syntenic region between these two species. We have
selected 27 non-coding DNA fragments (in introns and intergenic regions) of
variable length (300-750 bp) in P. vivax in this syntenic region. PCR of P. vivax
isolates of a population sample from India could successfully amplify 17
fragments. Subsequently, DNA sequencing and sequence analysis confirmed the
polymorphic status of only 11 fragments. Altogether, 18 SNPs were detected and 2 
different measures of nucleotide diversity showed variable patterns across
different fragments; in general, introns were less variable than the intergenic
regions. All 11 polymorphic fragments were found to be evolving according to a
neutral equilibrium model and thus could be utilized as putatively neutral
markers for population genetic studies in P. vivax. Different molecular
population genetics parameters were also estimated, providing initial insight
into the population genetics of Indian P. vivax.

Plasmodium falciparum isolates from Angola show the StctVMNT haplotype in the
pfcrt gene.

Janeiro, Brazil.

BACKGROUND: Effective treatment remains a mainstay of malaria control, but it is 
unfortunately strongly compromised by drug resistance, particularly in Plasmodium
falciparum, the most important human malaria parasite. Although P. falciparum
chemoresistance is well recognized all over the world, limited data are available
on the distribution and prevalence of pfcrt and pfmdr1 haplotypes that mediate
resistance to commonly used drugs and that show distinct geographic differences.
METHODS: Plasmodium falciparum-infected blood samples collected in 2007 at four
municipalities of Luanda, Angola, were genotyped using PCR and direct DNA
sequencing. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the P. falciparum pfcrt and pfmdr1
genes were assessed and haplotype prevalences were determined.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The most prevalent pfcrt haplotype was StctVMNT
(representing amino acids at codons 72-76). This result was unexpected, since the
StctVMNT haplotype has previously been seen mainly in parasites from South
America and India. The CVIET, CVMNT and CVINT drug-resistance haplotypes were
also found, and one previously undescribed haplotype (CVMDT) was detected.
Regarding pfmdr1, the most prevalent haplotype was YEYSNVD (representing amino
acids at codons 86, 130, 184, 1034, 1042, 1109 and 1246). Wild haplotypes for
pfcrt and pfmdr1 were uncommon; 3% of field isolates harbored wild type pfcrt
(CVMNK), whereas 21% had wild type pfmdr1 (NEYSNVD). The observed predominance of
the StctVMNT haplotype in Angola could be a result of frequent travel between
Brazil and Angola citizens in the context of selective pressure of heavy CQ use.
CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of the pfcrt SVMNT haplotype and the pfmdr1 86Y 
mutation confirm high-level chloroquine resistance and might suggest reduced
efficacy of amodiaquine in Angola. Further studies must be encouraged to examine 
the in vitro sensitivity of pfcrt SVMNT parasites to artesunate and amodiaquine
for better conclusive data.

mutation, V1010L, in the voltage gated Na+ channel of Anopheles culicifacies from
Orissa, India.

BACKGROUND: Knockdown resistance in insects resulting from mutation(s) in the
voltage gated Na+ channel (VGSC) is one of the mechanisms of resistance against
DDT and pyrethroids. Recently a point mutation leading to Leu-to-Phe substitution
in the VGSC at residue 1014, a most common kdr mutation in insects, was reported 
in Anopheles culicifacies-a major malaria vector in the Indian subcontinent. This
study reports the presence of two additional amino acid substitutions in the VGSC
of an An. culicifacies population from Malkangiri district of Orissa, India.
METHODS: Anopheles culicifacies sensu lato (s.l.) samples, collected from a
population of Malkangiri district of Orissa (India), were sequenced for part of
the second transmembrane segment of VGSC and analyzed for the presence of
non-synonymous mutations. A new primer introduced restriction analysis-PCR
(PIRA-PCR) was developed for the detection of the new mutation L1014S. The An.
culicifacies population was genotyped for the presence of L1014F substitution by 
an amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) and for L1014S substitutions
by using a new PIRA-PCR developed in this study. The results were validated
through DNA sequencing.
RESULTS: DNA sequencing of An. culicifacies individuals collected from district
Malkangiri revealed the presence of three amino acid substitutions in the IIS6
transmembrane segments of VGSC, each one resulting from a single point mutation. 
Two alternative point mutations, 3042A>T transversion or 3041T>C transition, were
found at residue L1014 leading to Leu (TTA)-to-Phe (TTT) or -Ser (TCA) changes,
respectively. A third and novel substitution, Val (GTG)-to-Leu (TTG or CTG), was 
identified at residue V1010 resulting from either of the two
transversions-3028G>T or 3028G>C. The L1014S substitution co-existed with V1010L 
in all the samples analyzed irrespective of the type of point mutation associated
with the latter. The PIRA-PCR strategy developed for the identification of the
new mutation L1014S was found specific as evident from DNA sequencing results of 
respective samples. Since L1014S was found tightly linked to V1010L, no separate 
assay was developed for the latter mutation. Screening of population using
PIRA-PCR assays for 1014S and ARMS for 1014F alleles revealed the presence of all
the three amino acid substitutions in low frequency.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of the presence of L1014S (homologous to
the kdr-e in An. gambiae) and a novel mutation V1010L (resulting from G-to-T or
-C transversions) in the VGSC of An. culicifacies in addition to the previously
described mutation L1014F. The V1010L substitution was tightly linked to L1014S
substitution. A new PIRA-PCR strategy was developed for the detection of L1014S
mutation and the linked V1010L mutation.

Analysis of gene mutations involved in chloroquine resistance in Plasmodium
falciparum parasites isolated from patients in the southwest of Saudi Arabia.

Centre, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Chloroquine has been the drug of choice for the
treatment of malaria for many decades. We aimed to examine the molecular basis of
chloroquine resistance among Plasmodium falciparum isolates from the southwestern
region of Saudi Arabia by analyzing the K76T and N86Y mutations in the PfCRT and 
PfMDR1 genes, respectively.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: P falciparum-infected blood spot samples (n=121) were
collected on filter papers. DNA was extracted and fragments from the above genes 
were amplified using nested PCR. The amplicons were digested by ApoI enzyme and
sequenced.
RESULTS: Of the 121 samples, 95 and 112 samples could be amplified for PfCRT K76T
and PfMDR1 N86Y mutations, respectively. All of the samples amplified for the
PfCRT K76T mutation were undigestible by ApoI, suggesting the presence of the
K76T mutation. For the PfMDR1 N86Y mutation, 65/109 samples (59.6%) were
digestible when treated with ApoI in a pattern, suggestive of the presence of the
investigated wild allele (N86). However, 44/109 samples (40.4%) were digestible
by ApoI, suggesting the presence of the mutated allele (Y) at position 86. DNA
sequencing confirmed these results.
CONCLUSION: Surprisingly, all isolates exhibited the mutated allele at codon 76
(K76T) of PfCRT. However, the mutated mutant allele at codon 86 (N86Y) of PfMDR1 
was found in 40.4% of the samples studied. To our knowledge, this is the first
study that has investigated the existence of the mutation in the PfMDR1 gene in
the country. This study will contribute to the development of new strategies for 
therapeutic intervention against malaria in Saudi Arabia.

Markers of anti-malarial drug resistance in Plasmodium falciparum isolates from
Swaziland: identification of pfmdr1-86F in natural parasite isolates.

Tropical Medicine, Keppel St, London WC1E 7HT, UK.

BACKGROUND: The development of Plasmodium falciparum resistance to chloroquine
(CQ) has limited its use in many malaria endemic areas of the world. However,
despite recent drug policy changes to adopt the more effective artemisinin-based 
combination (ACT) in Africa and in the Southern African region, in 2007 Swaziland
still relied on CQ as first-line anti-malarial drug.
METHODS: Parasite DNA was amplified from P. falciparum isolates from Swaziland
collected in 1999 (thick smear blood slides) and 2007 (filter paper blood spots).
Markers of CQ and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) resistance were identified by
probe-based qPCR and DNA sequencing.
RESULTS: Retrospective microscopy, confirmed by PCR amplification, found that
only six of 252 patients treated for uncomplicated malaria in 2007 carried
detectable P. falciparum. The pfcrt haplotype 72C/73V/74I/75E/76T occurred at a
prevalence of 70% (n = 64) in 1999 and 83% (n = 6) in 2007. Prevalence of the
pfmdr1-86N allele was 24% in 1999 and 67% in 2007. A novel substitution of
phenylalanine for asparagine at codon 86 of pfmdr1 (N86F) occurred in two of 51
isolates successfully amplified from 1999. The pfmdr1-1246Y allele was common in 
1999, with a prevalence of 49%, but was absent among isolates collected in 2007. 
The 86N/184F/1246D pfmdr1 haplotype, associated with enhanced parasite survival
in patients treated with artemether-lumefantrine, comprised 8% of 1999 isolates, 
and 67% among 2007 isolates. The pfdhfr triple-mutant 16C/51I/59R/108N/164I
haplotype associated with pyrimethamine resistance was common in both 1999 (82%, 
n = 34) and 2007 (50%, n = 6), as was the wild-type 431I/436S/437A/540K/581A/613A
haplotype of pfdhps (100% and 93% respectively in 1999 and 2007). The
quintuple-mutant haplotype pfdhfr/pfdhps-CIRNI/ISGEAA, associated with high-level
resistance to SP, was rare (9%) among 1999 isolates and absent among 2007
isolates.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of pfcrt and pfmdr1 alleles reported in this study is
consistent with a parasite population under sustained CQ drug pressure. The low
prevalence of dhps-437G and dhps-540E mutations (ISGEAA) and the rarity of
quintuple-mutant haplotype pfdhfr/pfdhps-CIRNI/ISGEAA suggest that SP retains
some efficacy in Swaziland. Anti-malarial policy changes in neighbouring
countries may have had an impact on the prevalence of molecular markers of
anti-malarial resistance in Swaziland, and it is hoped that this new information 
will add to understanding of the regional anti-malarial resistance map.

BACKGROUND: Larval mosquito habitats of potential malaria vectors and related
species of Anopheles from three provinces (Gyeonggi, Gyeongsangbuk,
Chungcheongbuk Provinces) of the Republic of Korea were surveyed in 2007. This
study aimed to determine the species composition, seasonal occurrence and
distributions of Anopheles mosquitoes. Satellite derived normalized difference
vegetation index data (NDVI) was also used to study the seasonal abundance
patterns of Anopheles mosquitoes.
METHODS: Mosquito larvae from various habitats were collected using a standard
larval dipper or a white plastic larval tray, placed in plastic bags, and were
preserved in 100% ethyl alcohol for species identification by PCR and DNA
sequencing. The habitats in the monthly larval surveys included artificial
containers, ground depressions, irrigation ditches, drainage ditches, ground
pools, ponds, rice paddies, stream margins, inlets and pools, swamps, and
uncultivated fields. All field-collected specimens were identified to species,
and relationships among habitats and locations based on species composition were 
determined using cluster statistical analysis.
RESULTS: In about 10,000 specimens collected, eight species of Anopheles
belonging to three groups were identified: Hyrcanus Group - Anopheles sinensis,
Anopheles kleini, Anopheles belenrae, Anopheles pullus, Anopheles lesteri,
Anopheles sineroides; Barbirostris Group - Anopheles koreicus; and Lindesayi
Group - Anopheles lindesayi japonicus. Only An. sinensis was collected from all
habitats groups, while An. kleini, An. pullus and An. sineroides were sampled
from all, except artificial containers. The highest number of Anopheles larvae
was found in the rice paddies (34.8%), followed by irrigation ditches (23.4%),
ponds (17.0%), and stream margins, inlets and pools (12.0%). Anopheles sinensis
was the dominant species, followed by An. kleini, An. pullus and An. sineroides. 
The monthly abundance data of the Anopheles species from three locations (Munsan,
Jinbo and Hayang) were compared against NDVI and NDVI anomalies.
CONCLUSION: The species composition of Anopheles larvae varied in different
habitats at various locations. Anopheles populations fluctuated with the seasonal
dynamics of vegetation for 2007. Multi-year data of mosquito collections are
required to provide a better characterization of the abundance of these insects
from year to year, which can potentially provide predictive capability of their
population density based on remotely sensed ecological measurements.

Malaria vectors of Timor-Leste.

Australia. bob.cooper@defence.gov.au

BACKGROUND: The island of Timor lies at the south-eastern edge of Indonesia on
the boundary of the Oriental and Australian faunal regions. The country of
Timor-Leste, which occupies the eastern part of the island, is malarious, but
anopheline faunal surveys and malaria vector incrimination date back to the 1960 
s. Over the last decade the malaria vectors of south-east Asia and the south-west
Pacific have been intensely studied using molecular techniques that can confirm
identification within complexes of isomorphic species. The aim of this study is
to accurately identify the Anopheles fauna of Timor-Leste using these techniques.
METHODS: The survey was carried out over the period February to June 2001.
Standard entomological techniques--human landing collections, larval collections 
and CO2 baited light traps--were used to collect anophelines from the main
geographical regions: coastal plains, inland plains, and highlands. Specimens
were processed for identification by morphology and genotyped for the ribosomal
DNA ITS2 by restriction analysis and/or DNA sequencing. Phylogenetic relationship
of Anopheles sundaicus and Anopheles subpictus individuals was also assessed
using DNA sequences from the ITS2 and mitochondrial cytochrome-b. All specimens, 
other than those from larval surveys, were processed to detect the presence of
the Plasmodium parasite circumsporozoite protein by ELISA for vector
incrimination.
RESULTS: Of 2,030 specimens collected, seven species were identified by
morphology: Anopheles barbirostris, Anopheles aconitus, Anopheles annularis,
Anopheles maculatus, Anopheles peditaeniatus, An. sundaicus and Anopheles vagus. 
These were confirmed by molecular analysis with the addition of Anopheles
flavirostris and an unidentified species designated here as An. vagus genotype B.
This latter species was morphologically similar to An. vagus and An. subpictus
and is likely to be the An. subpictus described by other workers for Timor.
However, genetically this species showed strong affinities to the An. sundaicus
complex. Anopheles vagus was the most common species but was rarely collected
coming to bite humans; An. barbirostris and An. vagus genotype B were the two
most common species collected in human landing catches and both were found
positive for CS protein.
CONCLUSIONS: The anopheline fauna of Timor-Leste is of Oriental origin with no
evidence of elements from the Australian Region. The existence of species
complexes will make the use of morphological markers problematic in the country. 
Using molecular analysis a number of issues regarding the anopheline fauna of
Timor-Leste were resolved and nine putative species of Anopheles were identified;
two species: An. barbirostris and An. vagus genotype B, were incriminated as
malaria vectors.

Janeiro, Brazil. bgama@ioc.fiocruz.br

BACKGROUND: The goal of the present study was the characterization of Plasmodium 
falciparum genes associated to malaria drug resistance (pfcrt, pfdhfr and
pfdhps), in samples from two Brazilian localities.
METHODS: Parasites from 65 P. falciparum samples were genotyped using nested-PCR 
and direct DNA sequencing.
RESULTS: Six resistant sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) pfdhfr genotypes and one
haplotype associated to SP sensitivity were detected. For pfcrt gene, SVMNT
chloroquine (CQ)-resistant genotype was detected as well as the CVMNK
CQ-sensitive haplotype in the same sample from Paragominas, that showed a
SP-sensitive genotype.
CONCLUSION: This study is the first to document the sensitivity of P. falciparum 
parasites to CQ and SP in Brazilian field samples. The importance of these
findings is discussed.

PCR-based methods for the detection of L1014 kdr mutation in Anopheles
culicifacies sensu lato.

BACKGROUND: Anopheles culicifacies s.l., a major malaria vector in India, has
developed widespread resistance to DDT and is becoming resistant to
pyrethroids-the only insecticide class recommended for the impregnation of bed
nets. Knock-down resistance due to a point mutation in the voltage gated sodium
channel at L1014 residue (kdr) is a common mechanism of resistance to DDT and
pyrethroids. The selection of this resistance may pose a serious threat to the
success of the pyrethroid-impregnated bed net programme. This study reports the
presence of kdr mutation (L1014F) in a field population of An. culicifacies s.l. 
and three new PCR-based methods for kdr genotyping.
METHODS: The IIS4-IIS5 linker to IIS6 segments of the para type voltage gated
sodium channel gene of DDT and pyrethroid resistant An. culicifacies s.l.
population from the Surat district of India was sequenced. This revealed the
presence of an A-to-T substitution at position 1014 leading to a
leucine-phenylalanine mutation (L1014F) in a few individuals. Three molecular
methods viz. Allele Specific PCR (AS-PCR), an Amplification Refractory Mutation
System (ARMS) and Primer Introduced Restriction Analysis-PCR (PIRA-PCR) were
developed and tested for kdr genotyping. The specificity of the three assays was 
validated following DNA sequencing of the samples genotyped.
RESULTS: The genotyping of this An. culicifacies s.l. population by the three PCR
based assays provided consistent result and were in agreement with DNA sequencing
result. A low frequency of the kdr allele mostly in heterozygous condition was
observed in the resistant population. Frequencies of the different genotypes were
in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
CONCLUSION: The Leu-Phe mutation, which generates the kdr phenotype in many
insects, was detected in a pyrethroid and DDT resistant An. culicifacies s.l.
population. Three PCR-based methods were developed for kdr genotyping. All the
three assays were specific. The ARMS method was refractory to non-specific
amplification in non-stringent amplification conditions. The PIRA-PCR assay is
able to detect both the codons for the phenylalanine mutation at kdr locus, i.e.,
TTT and TTC, in a single assay, although the latter codon was not found in the
population genotyped.

Most trials of antimalarials occur in areas in which reinfections are possible.
For Plasmodium falciparum, reinfections are distinguished from recrudescences by 
polymerase chain reaction analysis of 3 polymorphic genes. However, the validity 
of this approach has never been rigorously tested. We tested for
misclassification in 6 patients from clinical trials in Thailand and Cambodia who
were classified as being reinfected by the standard polymerase chain reaction
protocol. Using heteroduplex tracking assays and direct DNA sequencing, we found 
that 5 (83%) of 6 patients were misclassified. Misclassification in this manner
overestimates the efficacy of antimalarials and delays the recognition of
decreasing therapeutic efficacy, thus delaying potential changes in policy.

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) mutations and haemoglobinuria syndrome
in the Vietnamese population.

BACKGROUND: In Vietnam the blackwater fever syndrome (BWF) has been associated
with malaria infection, quinine ingestion and G6PD deficiency. The G6PD variants 
within the Vietnamese Kinh contributing to the disease risk in this population,
and more generally to haemoglobinuria, are currently unknown.
METHOD: Eighty-two haemoglobinuria patients and 524 healthy controls were
screened for G6PD deficiency using either the methylene blue reduction test, the 
G-6-PDH kit or the micro-methaemoglobin reduction test. The G6PD gene variants
were screened using SSCP combined with DNA sequencing in 82 patients with
haemoglobinuria, and in 59 healthy controls found to be G6PD deficient.
RESULTS: This study confirmed that G6PD deficiency is strongly associated with
haemoglobinuria (OR = 15, 95% CI [7.7 to 28.9], P < 0.0001). Six G6PD variants
were identified in the Vietnamese population, of which two are novel (Vietnam1
[Glu3Lys] and Vietnam2 [Phe66Cys]). G6PD Viangchan [Val291Met], common throughout
south-east Asia, accounted for 77% of the variants detected and was significantly
associated with haemoglobinuria within G6PD-deficient ethnic Kinh Vietnamese (OR 
= 5.8 95% CI [114-55.4], P = 0.022).
CONCLUSION: The primary frequency of several G6PD mutations, including novel
mutations, in the Vietnamese Kinh population are reported and the contribution of
G6PD mutations to the development of haemoglobinuria are investigated.

We have developed a High-Resolution DNA Melting method to detect mutations
related to Plasmodium falciparum resistance. This method is based on real-time
PCR followed by High Resolution Melting ramping from 67 degrees C to 80 degrees C
with fluorescence data acquisition set at 0.1 degrees C increments. The accuracy 
of the technique was assessed using 177 P. falciparum clinical isolates and two
reference strains. Results perfectly matched those obtained by DNA sequencing for
some important genetic markers of P. falciparum resistance. This technique could 
be of great value for epidemiological studies, especially in developing
countries.

Treatment of acute malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum may include
long-half-life drugs, such as the antifolate combination
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), to provide posttreatment chemoprophylaxis against
parasite recrudescence or delayed emergence from the liver. An unusual case of P.
falciparum recrudescence in a returned British traveler who received such a
regimen, as well as a series of 44 parasite isolates from the same hospital, was 
analyzed by PCR and direct DNA sequencing for the presence of markers of parasite
resistance to chloroquine and antifolates. The index patient harbored a mixture
of wild-type and resistant pfdhfr and pfdhps alleles upon initial presentation.
During his second malaria episode, he harbored only resistant parasites, with the
haplotypes IRNI (codons 51, 59, 108, and 164) and SGEAA (codons 436, 437, 540,
581, and 613) at these two loci, respectively. Analysis of isolates from 44 other
patients showed that the pfdhfr haplotype IRNI was common (found in 81% of
cases). The SGEAA haplotype of pfdhps was uncommon (found only in eight cases of 
East African origin [17%]). A previously undescribed mutation, I431V, was
observed for seven cases of Nigerian origin, occurring as one of two haplotypes, 
VAGKGS or VAGKAA. The presence of this mutation was also confirmed in isolates of
Nigerian origin from the United Kingdom Malaria Reference Laboratory. The
presence of the pfdhps haplotype SGEAA in P. falciparum parasites of East African
origin appears to compromise the efficacy of treatment regimens that include SP
as a means to prevent recrudescence. Parasites with novel pfdhps haplotypes are
circulating in West Africa. The response of these parasites to chemotherapy needs
to be evaluated.

Paulo, Ribeirão Preto, SP, Brasil. simone@uea.edu.br

The main purpose of this research was to analyze the relation of the genetic
polymorphisms frequently expressed by antigen-presenting cells, erythrocytes and 
malaria susceptibility/resistance with the human malaria infection cases. The
sample used consisted of 23 Plasmodium vivax (Pv)- and P. falciparum
(Pf)-infected patients, and 21 healthy individuals as a control group, from the
Baixo Amazonas population in Pará, Brazil. The Asp299Gly polymorphisms in the
Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), and Gly42Asp, Arg89Cys, Ala100Thr, and T-33C in the 
Duffy gene (FY) were analyzed by restriction fragment length
polymorphism-polymerase chain reaction. The Lys1590Glu and Arg1601Gly
polymorphisms in the complement receptor type 1 (CR1) were analyzed by DNA
sequencing. According to the results obtained and statistical analysis
considering a significance level or alpha = 0.01, we conclude that the low
heterozygote frequency (2.27%) for the Asp299Gly mutation, detected in the TLR4
gene, is not related to the Pv and Pf infections in the patients analyzed. Also, 
the promoter region GATA-1 analysis of the FY gene in the Pv-infected patients
showed that the heterozygote frequency for the T-33C mutation (11.36% of the
infected patients and 20.45% of the control patients) is not related to infection
resistance. Regarding the CR1 gene, the observed heterozygote frequency (9.09%)
for the Arg1601Gly mutation in Pf-infected patients when compared to heterozygote
frequency in the control group (18.18%) suggests that there is no correlation
with infection resistance.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the severity of Plasmodium falciparum attack in
endemic areas was associated with the multiplicity of infection (MOI) and/or with
a particular genotype(s).
METHOD: In two areas of different malaria transmission pattern in Madagascar
(Sainte-Marie - mesoendemic and Tsiroanomandidy - hypoendemic) the number and the
proportions of msp-2 genotypes within isolates were determined for each patient
using a capillary electrophoresis genotyping method. DNA sequencing was performed
to identify the msp-2 allelic family of dominant clones.
RESULTS: Eighty six uncomplicated and 33 severe cases were included in
Sainte-Marie and 48 uncomplicated and 69 severe cases were included in
Tsiroanomandidy. We found no association between the MOI and severity of malaria 
as the same mean number of msp-2 genotypes was found in isolates from
uncomplicated and from severe malaria cases (3.72 and 3.73, respectively,
P>0.05). The study of the association of dominant clones with clinical status
showed no particular genotype or allelic family associated with malaria severity.
CONCLUSIONS: Severity of malaria was not associated with higher MOI in our study.
Severity did not appear restricted to some particular genotypes either. On the
contrary, severe malaria appeared to be caused by very common genotypes in the
studied areas. More comprehensive explorations including immunity and genetic
factors of the host are needed to acquire new information about this complex
condition.

BACKGROUND: The Plasmodium falciparum P126 protein is an asexual blood-stage
malaria vaccine candidate antigen. Antibodies against P126 are able to inhibit
parasite growth in vitro, and a major parasite-inhibitory epitope has been
recently mapped to its 47 kDa N-terminal extremity (octamer repeat domain--OR
domain). The OR domain basically consists of six octamer units, but variation in 
the sequence and number of repeat units may appear in different alleles. The aim 
of the present study was to investigate the polymorphism of P126 N-terminal
region OR domain in P. falciparum isolates from two Brazilian malaria endemic
areas and its impact on anti-OR naturally acquired antibodies.
METHODS: The study was carried out in two villages, Candeias do Jamari (Rondonia 
state) and Peixoto de Azevedo (Mato Grosso state), both located in the
south-western part of the Amazon region. The repetitive region of the gene
encoding the P126 antigen was PCR amplified and sequenced with the di-deoxy chain
termination procedure. The antibody response was evaluated by ELISA with the Nt47
synthetic peptide corresponding to the P126 OR-II domain.
RESULTS: Only two types of OR fragments were identified in the studied areas, one
of 175 bp (OR-I) and other of 199 bp (OR-II). A predominance of the OR-II
fragment was observed in Candeias do Jamari whereas in Peixoto de Azevedo both
fragments OR-I and OR-II were frequent as well as mixed infection (both fragments
simultaneously) reported here for the first time. Comparing the DNA sequencing of
OR-I and OR-II fragments, there was a high conservation among predicted amino
acid sequences of the P126 N-terminal extremity. Data of immune response
demonstrated that the OR domain is highly immunogenic in natural conditions of
exposure and that the polymorphism of the OR domain does not apparently influence
the specific immune response.
CONCLUSION: These findings confirm a limited genetic polymorphism of the P126 OR 
domain in P. falciparum isolates and that this limited genetic polymorphism does 
not seem to influence the development of a specific humoral immune response to
P126 and its immunogenicity in the studied population.

In the major malaria vector Anopheles gambiae Giles, two point mutations at the
voltage-gated sodium channel have been associated with knockdown resistance (kdr)
to DDT and pyrethroid insecticides. Simple allele-specific polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) assays to detect these single-nucleotide polymorphisms are prone
to lack of specificity and therefore alternative techniques have been proposed.
However, these may not be easily implemented in many laboratories from malaria
endemic regions. Here, we describe a primer-introduced restriction analysis
(PIRA)-PCR method to detect kdr mutations in An. gambiae. This method
unambiguously identified all six genotypes for the kdr locus in a sample of 113
field-collected mosquitoes for which kdr genotypes had been confirmed by DNA
sequencing. Co-occurrence of both kdr alleles was found in sites from Equatorial 
Guinea and Gabon and the L1014F mutation was detected in M-form individuals from 
Angola. The PIRA-PCR proved to be a reliable, robust, and simpler alternative for
the detection of kdr mutations in this malaria vector.

The introduction of molecular diagnostic methods is crucial for improved
understanding of the aetiology and epidemiology of bacterial infections in
communities in resource poor settings. A blood sample from a 7 month old patient 
diagnosed with malaria in 2001 in a Gambian outpatient clinic was reported as
culture negative after it was subjected to traditional bacterial culture
protocols. We re-addressed the analysis of the blood sample from this case more
recently (after 6.5 years in archival storage) in pilot work establishing 16S
rRNA PCR in our molecular laboratory. Initial 16S rRNA PCR results confirmed the 
presence of bacterial DNA in the sample. 16S rRNA sequence analysis identified
the organism as Campylobacter spp. In light of the molecular evidence we
successfully grew the organism using appropriate culture conditions and
subsequently biochemically confirmed that the isolate was Campylobacter jejuni.
PCR and DNA sequencing of a set of seven C. jejuni housekeeping genes and in
silico Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) analysis revealed that the isolate
exhibits a novel sequence type (ST) of C. jejuni (ST 2928) and belongs to ST-443 
clonal complex. This study demonstrates the potential for molecular tools to
enhance the diagnosis of bacterial infections, which remain a major killer
globally, not least in children in the developing world. Improvements in
diagnostics are needed, and will be important not only for sick individuals but
also for populations, where better measures of disease burden will contribute
significantly to the improvement of public health policy.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the in vitro efficacy of artesunate (ATN) and artemether
(ATH) against Plasmodium falciparum isolates from the Brazilian Amazon state of
Pará and to search for mutations and/or altered copy numbers in the putative
resistance-associated pfcrt, pfmdr1 and pfATPase6 genes.
METHODS: In vitro efficacy of ATN and ATH was successfully measured in 56 freshly
collected P. falciparum isolates, using a conventional WHO microtest with minor
modifications. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the same isolates were
inspected using DNA sequencing and/or PCR-RFLP. We used real-time quantitative
PCR to assess gene copy numbers.
RESULTS: ATN and ATH geometric mean IC(50)s were 0.85 nm, 95% CI (0.55-1.15) and 
3.0 nm, 95% CI (1.5-4.5), respectively. There was extremely limited diversity of 
pfcrt and pfmdr1 genotypes and three SNPs were identified in the pfATPase6 gene: 
one T to A synonymous mutation at nucleotide 2694 and two non-synonymous (both G 
to A) mutations at nucleotides 110 and 1916, causing predicted aminoacid shifts
of arginine to lysine and of glycine to aspartate, respectively. The previously
reported S769N mutation was not detected in any of the isolates inspected. In
addition, no gene amplifications were detected in a subset of eight isolates.
CONCLUSION: Artemisinin derivatives display satisfactory in vitro activity
locally and the pfATPase6 gene is distinct from that reported in French Guiana,
suggesting that those haplotypes have not been introduced regionally.

cytochrome b gene of Plasmodium falciparum from different endemic regions of
Thailand.

BACKGROUND: The emergence of Plasmodium falciparum resistant to most currently
used antimalarial drugs is the major problem in malaria control along the
Thai-Myanmar and Thai-Cambodia borders. Although artemisinin-based combination
therapy has been recommended for the treatment of multidrug-resistant falciparum 
malaria, these combinations are not available for some people, such as travelers 
from North America. A fixed-dose combination of atovaquone and proguanil
(Malarone) has been proved to be effective for the treatment and prophylaxis of
malaria which is already approved by countries in North America and Europe.
Determination of the phenotypes and genotypes related to atovaquone/proguanil
response in Thai isolates of P. falciparum will be useful for rationale drug use.
The main purpose of this study was to explore the in vitro atovaquone/proguanil
susceptibility of recently adapted Thai isolates of P. falciparum. Genotypic
characterization of the cytb gene of these isolates was also determined since it 
has been reported that point mutations, particularly codon 268 in the cytochrome 
b gene (cytb) have been linked to atovaquone/proguanil treatment failure.
METHODS: Eighty three P. falciparum isolates collected during 1998 to 2005 from
four different multidrug resistance areas of Thailand were determined for the in 
vitro atovaquone/proguanil susceptibilities using radioisotopic assay. Mutations 
in the cytb gene were determined by PCR-RFLP and sequence analysis.
RESULTS: The mean atovaquone and proguanil IC50 was 3.4 nM and 36.5 muM,
respectively. All 83 Thai isolates were atovaquone sensitive. None of the 83
isolates contained the mutations at codon 268 of the cytb gene. DNA sequencing of
the cytb gene of 20 parasite isolates showed no other mutations.
CONCLUSION: In agreement with a recent efficacy study of atovaquone/proguanil,
the present information indicates that atovaquone/proguanil can be one of the
drugs of choice for the treatment and prophylaxis of multidrug-resistant
falciparum malaria in Thailand.

BACKGROUND: Susceptibility/resistance to Plasmodium falciparum malaria has been
correlated with polymorphisms in more than 30 human genes with most association
analyses having been carried out on patients from Africa and south-east Asia. The
aim of this study was to examine the possible contribution of genetic variants in
the TNF and FCGR2A genes in determining severity/resistance to P. falciparum
malaria in Indian subjects.
METHODS: Allelic frequency distribution in populations across India was first
determined by typing genetic variants of the TNF enhancer and the FCGR2A G/A SNP 
in 1871 individuals from 55 populations. Genotyping was carried out by DNA
sequencing, single base extension (SNaPshot), and DNA mass array (Sequenom).
Plasma TNF was determined by ELISA. Comparison of datasets was carried out by
Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests. Haplotypes and LD plots were generated by 
PHASE and Haploview, respectively. Odds ratio (OR) for risk assessment was
calculated using EpiInfotrade mark version 3.4.
RESULTS: A novel single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at position -76 was
identified in the TNF enhancer along with other reported variants. Five TNF
enhancer SNPs and the FCGR2A R131H (G/A) SNP were analyzed for association with
severity of P. falciparum malaria in a malaria-endemic and a non-endemic region
of India in a case-control study with ethnically-matched controls enrolled from
both regions. TNF -1031C and -863A alleles as well as homozygotes for the TNF
enhancer haplotype CACGG (-1031T>C, -863C>A, -857C>T, -308G>A, -238G>A)
correlated with enhanced plasma TNF levels in both patients and controls.
Significantly higher TNF levels were observed in patients with severe malaria.
Minor alleles of -1031 and -863 SNPs were associated with increased
susceptibility to severe malaria. The high-affinity IgG2 binding FcgammaRIIa AA
(131H) genotype was significantly associated with protection from disease
manifestation, with stronger association observed in the malaria non-endemic
region. These results represent the first genetic analysis of the two immune
regulatory molecules in the context of P. falciparum severity/resistance in the
Indian population.
CONCLUSION: Association of specific TNF and FCGR2A SNPs with cytokine levels and 
disease severity/resistance was indicated in patients from areas with
differential disease endemicity. The data emphasizes the need for addressing the 
contribution of human genetic factors in malaria in the context of disease
epidemiology and population genetic substructure within India.

Genetic influences on mosquito feeding behavior and the emergence of zoonotic
pathogens.

The feeding behavior of vectors influences the likelihood of pathogen invasion
and the exposure of humans to vector-borne zoonotic pathogens. We used multilocus
microsatellite genetic typing of an introduced mosquito vector and DNA sequencing
of mosquito blood meals to determine the impact of hybrid ancestry on feeding
behavior and the emergence of West Nile virus (WNV). The probability of ancestry 
of Culex pipiens mosquitoes from two bionomically divergent forms, form molestus 
and form pipiens, influenced the probability that they fed on humans but did not 
explain a late summer feeding shift from birds to humans. We used a simple model 
to show that the occurrence of pure form molestus mosquitoes would have decreased
the likelihood of WNV invasion (R(0) in bird populations) 3- to 8-fold, whereas
the occurrence of pure forms pipiens mosquitoes would have halved human exposure 
compared with the hybrids that are present. Data and modeling suggest that
feeding preferences may be influenced by genetic ancestry and contribute to the
emergence of vector-borne pathogens transmitted by introduced species, including 
malaria, and dengue, Chikungunya, yellow fever, and West Nile viruses.

of Medicine, 10900 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA. arlene.dent@case.edu

The merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP-1) is a blood stage antigen currently being 
tested as a vaccine against Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Determining the
MSP-1(19) haplotype(s) present during infection is essential for assessments of
MSP-1 vaccine efficacy and studies of protective immunity in human populations.
The C-terminal fragment (MSP-1(19)) has four predominant haplotypes based on
point mutations resulting in non-synonymous amino acid changes: E-TSR (PNG-MAD20 
type), E-KNG (Uganda-PA type), Q-KNG (Wellcome type), and Q-TSR (Indo type).
Current techniques using direct DNA sequencing are laborious and expensive. We
present an MSP-1(19) allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR)/ligase
detection reaction-fluorescent microsphere assay (LDR-FMA) that allows
simultaneous detection of the four predominant MSP-1(19) haplotypes with a
sensitivity and specificity comparable with other molecular methods and a
semi-quantitative determination of haplotype contribution in mixed infections.
Application of this method is an inexpensive, accurate, and high-throughput
alternative to distinguish the predominant MSP-1(19) haplotypes in epidemiologic 
studies.

OBJECTIVE: To develop a method for comparing the haplotypes of pfcrt polymorphism
of Hainan Province with those from other areas of the world.
METHODS: Nested PCR was used to amplify the polymorphic region including codon 72
to 76 and 97 of pfcrt gene. The PCR products were digested by ApoI restriction
endonuclease to determine the allelic types. According to the allelic types, 6
products from each of mutant type and wild type were sequenced to analyze the
haplotypes of pfcrt polymorphism.
RESULTS: Bands in size of 195 bp appeared in all 19 samples. After ApoI
digestion, 11 samples contained one ApoI site when codon 76 of the pfcrt gene
codes for lysine (K76), which were visualized by the presence of 98 bp and 97 bp 
restriction fragments. The DNA sequencing revealed that 6 samples of chloroquine 
resistant P. falciparum carried pfcrt alleles encoding an amino acid haplotype of
CVIET (residues 72-76), and the haplotype of CVMNK was found in other 6 samples
with wild type pfcrt gene.
CONCLUSION: Haplotypes of pfcrt polymorphism from Hainan were the same as those
from southeast Asia and Africa.

BACKGROUND: The anti-malarial chloroquine can modulate the outcome of infection
during the Plasmodium sporogonic development, interfering with Plasmodium gene
expression and subsequently, with transmission. The present study sets to
identify Plasmodium genes that might be regulated by chloroquine in the mosquito 
vector.
METHODS: Differential display RT-PCR (DDRT-PCR) was used to identify genes
expressed during the sporogonic cycle that are regulated by exposure to
chloroquine. Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes were fed on Plasmodium yoelii
nigeriensis-infected mice. Three days post-infection, mosquitoes were fed a
non-infectious blood meal from mice treated orally with 50 mg/kg chloroquine. Two
differentially expressed Plasmodium transcripts (Pyn_chl091 and Pyn_chl055) were 
further characterized by DNA sequencing and real-time PCR analysis.
RESULTS: Both transcripts were represented in Plasmodium EST databases, but
displayed no homology with any known genes. Pyn_chl091 was upregulated by day 18 
post infection when the mosquito had a second blood meal. However, when the
effect of chloroquine on that transcript was investigated during the erythrocytic
cycle, no significant differences were observed. Although slightly upregulated by
chloroquine exposure the expression of Pyn_chl055 was more affected by
development, increasing towards the end of the sporogonic cycle. Transcript
abundance of Pyn_chl055 was reduced when erythrocytic stages were treated with
chloroquine.
CONCLUSION: Chloroquine increased parasite load in mosquito salivary glands and
interferes with the expression of at least two Plasmodium genes. The transcripts 
identified contain putative signal peptides and transmembrane domains suggesting 
that these proteins, due to their location, are targets of chloroquine (not as an
antimalarial) probably through cell trafficking and recycling.

Since 1963, reported malaria transmission in Haiti has been restricted to
Plasmodium falciparum. However, screening of Haitian refugees in Jamaica in 2004,
by microscopic examination, identified P. falciparum, P. vivax, and P. malariae. 
PCR confirmed the P. malariae and P. falciparum but not P. vivax infections. DNA 
sequencing and rRNA gene sequences showed transmission of P. malariae. This
report confirms that P. malariae is still being transmitted in Haiti.

Given the prevalence of relapsing fever (RF) in Senegal, this disease may cause
illness and death in other areas of West Africa. We performed a cross-sectional, 
clinic-based study to investigate the presence of RF in Togo during 2002-2004.
Blood samples from patients with fever were examined for RF spirochetes by
microscopy, PCR, and DNA sequencing of amplicons and for antibodies to the
glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase antigen. Although no spirochetes were
seen in blood smears, approximately 10% of the patients were positive by PCR and 
approximately 13% were seropositive for spirochetes. DNA sequencing demonstrated 
that Borrelia crocidurae and B. duttonii were present. Most patients were treated
for malaria whether or not plasmodia were observed. Thus, many RF patients
originally had a misdiagnosis of malaria, which resulted in ineffective
treatment. The inability of microscopic analysis to detect spirochetes compared
with PCR demonstrates the need for tests with greater sensitivity.

molecular analysis of putative resistance-associated mutations of Plasmodium
falciparum from São Tomé and Príncipe.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the basal in vitro responses of Plasmodium falciparum
isolates collected in The Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe to
artemether (ATH), artesunate (ATN) and amodiaquine (AMQ).
METHODS: The prevalence of given single nucleotide polymorphisms in the pfmdr1,
pfcrt, pftctp and pfATPase6 genes was assessed by PCR-RFLP or DNA sequencing, and
gene copy numbers were estimated by real-time PCR.
RESULTS: Mean IC50s to ATH and ATN were relatively low (1.12 nm and 0.58 nm,
respectively). However, 10% of parasites displayed AMQ IC50 values above the
accepted resistance threshold of 60 nm and there was a positive association
between susceptibility to all three drugs (ATH vs. ATN: R = 0.84; ATH vs. AMQ: R 
= 0.68; ATN vs. AMQ: R = 0.72). Mutations in the pfcrt and pfmdr1 genes were
highly prevalent, while only one synonymous polymorphism was detected in the
pfATPase6 gene and no mutations were found in pftctp. All isolates harboured a
single copy of the genes studied.
CONCLUSIONS: Artemisinin combination treatment in the São Tomé and Príncipe
should be efficacious, although a significant number of AMQ-resistant parasites
were detected and the susceptibility to each drug was positively associated with 
that of the other two. Mutations in the pfcrt and pfmdr1 genes are near fixation,
most likely because of high levels of chloroquine resistance, whereas only one
protein type of the artemisinin resistance candidate, PfATPase6, was identified.

Gainesville, Florida 32611-0888, USA.

Approximately 55% of malaria infections in the Guyana Amazon region are
attributed to Plasmodium falciparum while the other 45% are attributed to
non-falciparum, mostly Plasmodium vivax. However, little is known about the P.
vivax strain types circulating in the region. Using PCR for Plasmodium detection 
and two genetic markers specific to P. vivax to detect the polymorphic
circumsporozoite protein (CSP) and the conserved 19-kDa region of the merozoite
surface protein-1 (MSP-1), we investigated the overall Plasmodium strain
distribution and population diversity within P. vivax in isolates collected from 
the blood of infected individuals in the interior Amazon region of Guyana, South 
America. Out of a total of 250 samples positive for Plasmodium, P. vivax was
detected in 30% (76/250) and P. falciparum was detected in 76% (189/250). Mixed
infections containing both P. falciparum and P. vivax constituted 6% (15/250) of 
the total positive samples. Further analysis of P. vivax strains showed that 92% 
(56/61) of the P. vivax samples hybridized with a probe specific to type VK210,
39% (24/61) hybridized with a probe specific for type VK247, and 25% (15/61)
hybridized with a probe specific for the P. vivax-like CS genotype. DNA
sequencing of the 19-kDa C-terminal domain in block 13 of MSP-1 amplified from 61
samples from patients infected with P. vivax demonstrated that this region is
highly conserved, and all samples were identical at the nucleotide level to the
Belem and Salvador-1 types. No synonymous or nonsynonymous mutations were
observed in this region of the gene, indicating that current vaccine-development 
efforts based on the MSP-1(19) fragment would be applicable in Guyana.

Can Anopheles gambiae be infected with Wolbachia pipientis? Insights from an in

Wolbachia pipientis are maternally inherited endosymbionts associated with
cytoplasmic incompatibility, a potential mechanism to drive transgenic traits
into Anopheles populations for malaria control. W. pipientis infections are
common in many mosquito genera but have never been observed in any Anopheles
species, leading to the hypothesis that Anopheles mosquitoes are incapable of
harboring infection. We used an in vitro system to evaluate the ability of
Anopheles gambiae cells to harbor diverse W. pipientis infections. We
successfully established W. pipientis infections (strains wRi and wAlbB) in the
immunocompetent Anopheles gambiae cell line Sua5B. Infection was confirmed by
PCR, antibiotic curing, DNA sequencing, and direct observation using fluorescence
in situ hybridization. The infections were maintained at high passage rates for
>30 passages. Our results indicate that there is no intrinsic genetic block to W.
pipientis infection in A. gambiae cells, suggesting that establishment of in vivo
W. pipientis infections in Anopheles mosquitoes may be feasible.

We developed and evaluated a PCR-based assay to detect four Plasmodium species in
79 blood samples from 56 travelers returning from areas where malaria is endemic.
DNA amplification targeting a small region of the 18S rRNA gene was performed
with Plasmodium genus-specific primers. The biotinylated PCR products were then
identified by PCR-colorimetric Covalink NH microwell plate hybridization (CMPH)
using species-specific phosphorylated probes covalently bound to a pretreated
polystyrene surface. The results from PCR-CMPH showed high specificity, and for
47 of the 56 patients (84%), microscopy and PCR-CMPH results were in agreement.
Discordant results were reevaluated with microscopy examination, other molecular 
methods, and DNA sequencing. Except for one patient, discrepancies were resolved 
in favor of PCR-CMPH: three mixed infections were detected, four species
identification errors were corrected, and two negative results were shown to be
positive. Our results indicate that PCR-CMPH is a simple, rapid, and specific
method for malaria diagnosis. It employs stable reagents and inexpensive
equipment, making it suitable for routine epidemiological use.

Malaria kills over 3,000 children each day. Modern molecular and biochemical
approaches are being used to help understand and control Plasmodium falciparum,
the parasite that causes this deadly disease. New drugs are being invented for
both chemoprophylaxis and therapeutic treatments and their use is discussed along
side that of the more commonly used treatments. Classical genetic crosses coupled
with molecular analysis of gene loci are use to explain the genetics behind the
development of specific drug resistances that the parasites have naturally
developed. Rapid advances in DNA sequencing techniques have allowed the compete
sequencing of the P. falciparum and several other rodent malaria parasite
genomes. Proteomics and computational analysis of these vast databanks are being 
used to model and investigate the three-dimensional structure of many key malaria
proteins in an attempt to facilitate drug design. Recombinant protein expression 
in bacteria and yeast coupled with cGMP purification technologies and conditions 
have lead to the recent availability of several dozen malaria protein antigens
for human-use Phase I and Phase II vaccine trials. Drug companies, private
foundations, and key government agencies have contributed to the coordinated
efforts needed to test these antigens, adjuvants and delivery methods in an
effort to find an effective malaria vaccine that will prevent infection and
disease.

Molecular demonstration of SLC4A1 gene deletion in two Mexican patients with
Southeast Asian ovalocytosis.

Panamericana, Mexico City, Mexico.

We describe the finding of two Mexican patients with a specific 27-bp deletion in
the solute carrier family 4 gene (SLC4A1delta27) (also known as the band 3 gene
found on chromosome 17q21-q22), characteristic of Southeast Asian ovalocytosis
(SAO). The patients were asymptomatic, and the initial diagnosis was made by
microscopic observation of the presence of typical stomatocytic ovalocytes. The
gene deletion was confirmed by PCR and DNA sequencing. Both patients were
heterozygous for the deletion. One patient is from Tabasco state, in southeastern
Mexico, a malaria-endemic zone. The other patient is from Mexico City, which is
not a malaria-endemic area. Their families have no non-Mexican ancestors and
their previous generations were born in Mexico. Both patients carry the
HLA-B*3501 subtype, characteristic of Amerindians and Asian populations. Familial
and HLA data led us to conclude that these two patients are the first report of
SLC4A1delta27 in Amerindians. The nucleotide analysis showing a perfect match
sequence between Southeast Asian and Mexican patients suggests, but does not
prove, that the Mexican gene is not a de novo mutation. Instead, this gene might 
be the result of migration of individuals with Asian ancestry into the Mexican
gene pool. We are looking for other families with the mutation to detect, by HLA 
analysis, the ancient ethnic origin of these patients.

Artemisinin derivatives are an essential component of treatment against
multidrug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria. We aimed to investigate
in-vitro resistance to artemisinin derivatives in field isolates. In-vitro
susceptibility of 530 P falciparum isolates from three countries (Cambodia,
French Guiana, and Senegal) with different artemisinin use was assessed with an
isotopic microtest. Artemether IC50 up to 117 and 45 nmol/L was seen in French
Guiana and Senegal, respectively. DNA sequencing in a subsample of 60 isolates
lends support to SERCA-PfATPase6 as the target for artemisinins. The S769N
PfATPase6 mutation, noted exclusively in French Guiana, was associated with
raised (>30 nmol/L) artemether IC50s (p<0.0001, Mann-Whitney). All resistant
isolates came from areas with uncontrolled use of artemisinin derivatives. This
rise in resistance indicates the need for increased vigilance and a coordinated
and rapid deployment of drug combinations.

The Plasmodium protein network diverges from those of other eukaryotes.

Plasmodium falciparum is the pathogen responsible for over 90% of human deaths
from malaria. Therefore, it has been the focus of a considerable research
initiative, involving the complete DNA sequencing of the genome, large-scale
expression analyses, and protein characterization of its life-cycle stages. The
Plasmodium genome sequence is relatively distant from those of most other
eukaryotes, with more than 60% of the 5,334 encoded proteins lacking any notable 
sequence similarity to other organisms. To systematically elucidate functional
relationships among these proteins, a large two-hybrid study has recently mapped 
a network of 2,846 interactions involving 1,312 proteins within Plasmodium. This 
network adds to a growing collection of available interaction maps for a number
of different organisms, and raises questions about whether the divergence of
Plasmodium at the sequence level is reflected in the configuration of its protein
network. Here we examine the degree of conservation between the Plasmodium
protein network and those of model organisms. Although we find 29 highly
connected protein complexes specific to the network of the pathogen, we find very
little conservation with complexes observed in other organisms (three in yeast,
none in the others). Overall, the patterns of protein interaction in Plasmodium, 
like its genome sequence, set it apart from other species.

BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum outbreaks can occur in the coastal area of
French Guiana, where the population is essentially non-immune. Two sporadic
outbreaks were observed, including one with severe malaria cases. To characterize
these outbreaks and verify previous observations of specific genotype
characteristics in severe malaria in this area, all cases from each outbreak were
studied.
METHODS: P. falciparum genotypes for six genetic loci were determined by PCR
amplification from peripheral blood parasites. The msp1/block2 and msp2 genotypes
were determined by DNA sequencing. Microsatellite and varD genotyping was based
on size polymorphism and locus-specific amplification.
RESULTS: The outbreak including severe malaria cases was associated with a single
genotype. The other mild malaria outbreak was due to at least five distinct
genotypes.
CONCLUSION: Two distinct types of outbreak occurred despite systematic and
sustained deployment of malaria control measures, indicating a need for
reinforced vigilance. The varD/B-K1 msp1 linkage and its association with severe 
malaria in this area was confirmed.

Antibody response of naturally infected individuals to recombinant Plasmodium
vivax apical membrane antigen-1.

Universitária, São Paulo SP 05508-900, Brazil.

In the present study, we evaluate the naturally acquired antibody response to the
Plasmodium vivax apical membrane antigen 1 (PvAMA-1), a leading vaccine candidate
against malaria. The gene encoding the PvAMA-1 ectodomain region (amino acids
43-487) was cloned by PCR using genomic DNA from a Brazilian individual with
patent P. vivax infection. The predicted amino acid sequence displayed a high
degree of identity (97.3%) with a previously published sequence from the P. vivax
Salvador strain. A recombinant protein representing the PvAMA-1 ectodomain was
expressed in Escherichia coli and refolded. By ELISA, this recombinant protein
reacted with 85 and 48.5% of the IgG or IgM antibodies, respectively, from
Brazilian individuals with patent P. vivax malaria. IgG1 was the predominant
subclass of IgG. The frequency of response increased according to the number of
malaria episodes, reaching 100% in individuals in their fourth malaria episode.
The high degree of recognition of PvAMA-1 by human antibodies was confirmed using
a second recombinant protein expressed in Pichia pastoris (PV66/AMA-1). The
observation that recognition of the bacterial recombinant PvAMA-1 was only
slightly lower than that of the highly immunogenic 19kDa C-terminal domain of the
P. vivax Merozoite Surface Protein-1 was also important. DNA sequencing of the
PvAMA-1 variable domain from 20 Brazilian isolates confirmed the limited
polymorphism of PvAMA-1 suggested by serological analysis. In conclusion, we
provide evidence that PvAMA-1 is highly immunogenic during natural infection in
humans and displays limited polymorphism in Brazil. Based on these observations, 
we conclude that PvAMA-1 merits further immunological studies as a vaccine
candidate against P. vivax malaria.

The distribution of gene variants of the antigen processing proteins transporter 
associated with antigen processing type 1 (TAP1) and proteasome subunit beta type
9 (PSMB9) and of their shared bidirectional promoter was assessed in children
with either mild or severe malaria. The genetic study was performed on samples
collected during a longitudinal study on malariometric indices in an area
hyperendemic for Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Gabon. The allele frequencies
of the genes did not differ between the mild and the severe malaria groups. The
distributions of alleles among children with distinct phenotypes of severe
malaria were similar. A negative association of hypoglycaemia with the PSMB9
promoter variant PSMB9-R was found (odds ratio 0.01; chi2=12.1; P<0.0005;
Pc<0.03). The promoter allele TAP1-446G was associated with hyperparasitaemia and
absence of hypoglycaemia. TAP1, PSMB9, and TAP1/PSMB9 promoter alleles were in
strong linkage disequilibrium. DNA sequencing of the TAP1/PSMB9 promoter region
revealed a previously unrecognized single nucleotide polymorphism 455 bp upstream
of the TAP1 transcription start site.

A real-time PCR assay was developed to detect the K76T point mutation in the
Plasmodium falciparum putative chloroquine resistance transporter gene. The assay
was used with malaria positive clinical isolates from Rutshuru in the eastern
part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and from Malawi. The K76T
mutation was found in 52/56 (93%) clinical isolates from the DRC, where
chloroquine resistance is high, but in none of the 12 isolates tested from Malawi
where chloroquine is now rarely used. Sixteen percent of specimens from the DRC
had detectable levels of both wild-type and mutant alleles. The real-time PCR
results were compared to results from a nested allele-specific PCR assay and from
direct DNA sequencing. Using allele-specific PCR as the reference method, the new
assay is 100% sensitive and specific towards the mutant allele. In addition to
its low per-test cost, the new assay is fast, easily automated, sensitive and
well-suited to large-scale epidemiological studies.

Complement receptor-1 (CR1) is a ligand for rosette formation, a phenomenon
associated with cerebral malaria (CM). Binding is dependent on erythrocyte CR1
copy number. In Caucasians, low CR1 expressors have two linked mutations. We
determined the Q981H and HindIII RFLP distribution in differing population groups
to ascertain a possible role in adaptive evolution. We examined 194 Caucasians,
180 Choctaw Indians, 93 Chinese-Taiwanese, 304 Cambodians, 89 Papua New Guineans 
(PNG) and 366 Africans. PCR/RFLP used HindIII for CR1 expression and BstNI for
the Q981H mutation. DNA sequencing and pyrosequencing were performed to resolve
inconclusive results. Gene frequencies for the L allele were 0.15 in Africans,
0.16 in Choctaws, 0.18 in Caucasians, 0.29 in Chinese-Taiwanese, 0.47 in
Cambodians and 0.58 in PNG. Allelic frequency for 981H were 0.07 in Africans,
0.15 in Caucasians, 0.18 in Choctaws, 0.29 in Chinese-Taiwanese, 0.47 in
Cambodians and 0.54 in PNG. The Q981H polymorphism correlates with the HindIII
RFLP in most groups except West Africans and appears to be part of a low CR1
expression haplotype. The gene frequency for the haplotype is highest in the
malaria-endemic areas of Asia, suggesting that this haplotype may have evolved
because it protects from rosetting and CM.

Author information:

Service, School of Pathology, University of the Witwatersrand, Parktown,
Johannesburg 2193, South Africa.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Plasmodium falciparum malaria is one of the most
lethal infectious diseases afflicting humanity. During development within the
erythrocyte, P. falciparum induces significant modifications to the structure and
function of the human erythrocyte membrane. This study focused on the
identification of new protein-protein interactions between host and parasite.
DESIGN AND METHODS: A novel application of in vitro display technology was used: 
P. falciparum phage display expression libraries were screened against purified
human erythrocyte protein 4.1. DNA sequencing and bioinformatic analyses were
used to identify parasite proteins that bind protein 4.1.
RESULTS: P. falciparum proteins displaying strong binding specificity toward
protein 4.1 included five hypothetical proteins, erythrocyte binding antigen-175,
erythrocyte binding ligand-1 like protein and a putative serine/threonine kinase.
A common binding motif displaying homology to muscle myosin and neurofilament
sequences was also identified in four of the eight proteins.
INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: These proteins are potentially involved in the
invasion and/or release, as well as the growth and survival of malaria parasites 
during development with the red blood cell. The characterization of novel protein
interactions between P. falciparum and erythrocyte membrane protein 4.1 will lead
to a better understanding of malaria pathogenesis and parasite biology.

molecular beacons etc) for detection of the PCR-product or on DNA microarray
chips, is under development for routine use. Multiplex technology can be used to 
simultaneously detect multiple microorganisms as well as resistance genes. Using 
super-convection with ultracentrifugation high-speed PCR, results can be obtained
in 10 minutes and the amplificate can also be analyzed by DNA-sequencing to
achieve species identification as well as detection of resistance gene mutations.
The technique has mainly been applied to viruses, but is now slowly adapted to
bacteria, fungi, protozoa and helminths. PCR is especially well suited for slow
growing bacteria like Mycobacteria, fastidious organisms like Bartonella and
contagious agents like tularemia, but also for malaria and fungi, where the
advantages in sensitivity and speed can be exploited. The limit for application
to routine analysis will depend on the development of simple and fast procedures 
for nucleic acid extraction, as well as interpretation of the PCR analysis per
se, since highly efficient thermocyclers now are on the markets.

Is the expression of genes encoding enzymes of glutathione (GSH) metabolism
involved in chloroquine resistance in Plasmodium chabaudi parasites?

The genes encoding enzymes involved in glutathione (GSH) metabolism may modulate 
responses to antimalarial drugs, but the role of most of them in antimalarial
drug resistance has scarcely been investigated. Using an in silico/PCR combined
approach, we have isolated from Plasmodium chabaudi, full sequences of five
Plasmodium falciparum gene orthologues involved in GSH metabolism: the
gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (Pc-gammagcs), glutathione-synthetase (Pc-gs), 
glutathione peroxidase (Pc-gpx), glutathione reductase (Pc-gr) and
glutathione-S-transferase (Pc-gst). DNA sequencing of these genes from drug
sensitive parasites, P. chabaudi AS (0CQ), and ones isolated from parasite lines 
that show genetically stable resistance to chloroquine (CQ) at low, intermediate 
and high levels, AS (3CQ), AS (15CQ) and AS (30CQ), respectively, revealed no
point mutations in the resistant parasites. We used these sequences to design
internal oligonucleotide primers to compare relative mRNA amounts of these genes 
between all P. chabaudi clones, in untreated mice or following CQ treatment with 
sub-curative doses, by real-time PCR. Analysis of three independent experiments
revealed that transcription levels of the Pc-gammagcs, Pc-gs, Pc-gpx, Pc-gr and
Pc-gst genes were not changed between chloroquine sensitive and resistant
parasite clones, and that treatment with chloroquine did not induce an alteration
in the expression of these genes in sensitive or resistant parasites. We
concluded that chloroquine resistance in this species is determined by a
mechanism that is independent of these genes, and most likely, of GSH metabolism.

Molecular epidemiology of malaria in Cameroon. XVIII. Polymorphisms of the
Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface antigen-2 gene in isolates from
symptomatic patients.

Merozoite surface antigen-2 (MSA-2) is a polymorphic genetic marker that is
highly discriminatory for characterizing Plasmodium falciparum field isolates.
Genetic diversity of isolates obtained from symptomatic patients residing in
Yaounde, Cameroon was analyzed by an allele-specific polymerase chain reaction
and direct sequencing of amplification products. Of 137 isolates, 25 (18%) had
only FC27-type alleles, 40 (29%) had only 3D7-type alleles, and 72 (53%) had
multiple parasite populations with both alleles. Of 295 fragments, 145 (49.2%)
and 150 (50.8%) belonged to FC27 and 3D7 alleles, respectively. There were 23
different MSA-2 alleles (10 FC27-type and 13 3D7-type that yielded 44 different
combinations in multiple infections). DNA sequencing showed distinct individual
sequences. Sequences belonging to the FC27 allelic family were relatively
conserved, with most of the polymorphism arising from differences in the number
of repeat units. In contrast, the sequences within the GSA-rich region in 3D7
allelic family were less conserved, but many of the sequences in Cameroonian
isolates have been identified in other isolates from geographically distant
origins. Our results show an extensive diversity of the central region of MSA-2
in size, allelic family, combinations of these two features in multiple
infections, and sequence variations underlying the complex population structure
of P. falciparum clinical isolates in Yaounde, Cameroon.

Erratum in
    Transfusion. 2004 May;44(5):799-800.

BACKGROUND: DNA mutations resulting in the McCoy and Swain-Langley polymorphisms 
have been identified on complement receptor 1 (CR1)-a ligand for rosetting of
Plasmodium falciparum-infected RBCs. The molecular identification of the Kna/Knb 
polymorphism was sought to develop a genotyping method for use in the study of
the Knops blood group and malaria.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: CR1 deletion constructs were used in inhibition studies
of anti-Kna. PCR amplification of Exon 29 was followed by DNA sequencing. A
PCR-RFLP was developed with NdeI, BsmI, and MfeI for the detection of Kna/Knb,
McCa/McCb, and Sl1/Sl2, respectively. Knops phenotypes were determined with
standard serologic techniques.
RESULTS: A total of 310 Malian persons were phenotyped for Kna with 200 (64%)
Kn(a+) and 110 (36%) Kn(a-). Many of the Kn(a-) exhibited the Knops-null
phenotype, that is, Helgeson. The Kna/b DNA polymorphism was identified as a
V1561M mutation with allele frequencies of Kna (V1561) 0.9 and Knb (M1561) 0.1.
CONCLUSION: The high frequency (18%) of Knb in West African persons suggests that
it is not solely a Caucasian trait. Furthermore, because of the high incidence of
heterozygosity as well as amorphs, accurate Knops typing of donors of African
descent is best accomplished by a combination of molecular and serologic
techniques.

Genotyping of Plasmodium falciparum pyrimethamine resistance by matrix-assisted
laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.

Marks F(1), Meyer CG, Sievertsen J, Timmann C, Evans J, Horstmann RD, May J.

Author information:

Increasing resistance, recrudescences, and treatment failure have led to the
replacement of chloroquine with the combination of pyrimethamine (PYR) and
sulfadoxine (SDX) as the first-line antimalarial drugs for treatment of
uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in several areas where this disease
is endemic. The development of resistance to PYR-SDX is favored by incomplete
treatment courses or by subtherapeutic levels in plasma. PYR-SDX resistance has
been associated with several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the P.
falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (pfdhfr) and the P. falciparum dihydropteroate
synthetase (pfdhps) genes. We have established assays based on matrix-assisted
laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) that 
conveniently allow the identification of SNPs associated with PYR resistance.
Variants occurring at codon positions 16, 51, 59, and 108 of the pfdhfr gene were
analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS in synthetic oligonucleotides to determine the detection
threshold. In addition, 63 blood samples from subjects with P. falciparum
parasitemia of various degrees were analyzed. The results were compared to those 
obtained by DNA sequencing of the respective gene fragment. The results of
MALDI-TOF MS and DNA sequencing were consistent in 40 samples. In 23 samples two 
or three pfdhfr variants were detected by MALDI-TOF assays, whereas
DNA-sequencing revealed one variant only. Simultaneous detection of two different
mutations by biplex assays was, in principle, feasible. As demonstrated by the
example of PYR resistance, MALDI-TOF MS allows for rapid and automated
high-throughput assessment of drug sensitivity in P. falciparum malaria.

Molecular epidemiology of malaria in Cameroon. XVII. Baseline monitoring of
atovaquone-resistant Plasmodium falciparum by in vitro drug assays and cytochrome
b gene sequence analysis.

Afrique Centrale, Yaounde, Cameroon. Leonardo.Basco@ibaic.u-psud.fr

Atovaquone is a new broad-spectrum antiprotozoal drug with high in vitro activity
against multidrug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum. Its specific action against
protozoans is based on the inhibition of the parasite cytochrome bc1 complex of
the mitochondrial electron transport system. Protozoans may develop atovaquone
resistance by the selection of a mutant cytochrome b gene. With the increasing
availability of atovaquone-proguanil combination for prophylaxis and treatment of
malarial infections, it is necessary to establish baseline data on atovaquone
sensitivity before the drug is introduced massively in an endemic region. For
this purpose, the activity of atovaquone was assessed indirectly by in vitro drug
sensitivity assays with several serum substitutes and DNA sequencing of the
cytochrome b gene. Using the standard in vitro assay procedures with 10% human
serum, the geometric mean 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) for atovaquone was 
calculated to be 1.15 nM (range = 0.460-4.17 nM), while the use of 10% fetal calf
serum resulted in lower IC50s (geometric mean = 0.575, range = 0.266-2.20 nM).
The use of Albumax, a lipid-enriched bovine albumin, over the same concentration 
range (0.25-16 nM) showed poor results. None of the 37 isolates with an
atovaquone IC50 < 4.17 nM displayed any mutation. Further monitoring of
atovaquone-resistant P. falciparum is warranted for the rational use of this new 
antimalarial drug.

Two E. coli expressed recombinant polypeptides (rPvMSP-1(14) and rPvMSP-1(20))
contained in the 33kDa fragment, located within Plasmodium vivax merozoite
surface protein (PvMSP-1) 42kDa C-terminal region, and a cocktail of high
reticulocyte binding synthetic peptides located within these fragments, were
evaluated for immunogenicity and protective immune responses in splenectomised
and spleen intact Aotus nancymaae monkeys. Thirty splenectomised monkeys who had 
been previously immunised with either rPvMSP-1(14), rPvMSP-1(20), or a mixture of
both recombinant fragments were intravenously challenged with the heterologous P.
vivax VCG-1 strain (as determined by DNA sequencing); full protection was
observed in five monkeys and low parasitaemia levels were obtained in eight more 
monkeys. Splenectomised control monkey group rapidly developed high parasitaemia 
levels, while no significant parasitaemia was obtained in the non-splenectomised 
control group. Although PvMSP-1 42 and 33kDa fragments were recognised by Western
Blot and whole parasites by IFAT when tested with immune monkey sera, no
correlation between protection and antibody titres by IFAT and ELISA was
observed, suggesting that protection is not being solely mediated by a humoral
immune response. This data showed that partial protection against a heterologous 
strain challenge was best achieved when immunising with a
rPvMSP-1(14)-rPvMSP-1(20) mixture (2 were fully protected and 4 with low
parasitaemia out of 12) suggesting for the first time, that these fragments could
be good candidates for inclusion in a P. vivax multi-stage, multi-antigen
vaccine.

Genetic relatedness of Plasmodium falciparum isolates and the origin of allelic
diversity at the merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP-1) locus in Brazil and Vietnam.

Universidade de São Paulo, Brazil. hoffmann@usp.br

BACKGROUND: Despite the extensive polymorphism at the merozoite surface protein-1
(MSP-1) locus of Plasmodium falciparum, that encodes a major repetitive malaria
vaccine candidate antigen, identical and nearly identical alleles frequently
occur in sympatric parasites. Here we used microsatellite haplotyping to estimate
the genetic distance between isolates carrying identical and nearly identical
MSP-1 alleles.
METHODS: We analyzed 28 isolates from hypoendemic areas in north-western Brazil, 
collected between 1985 and 1998, and 23 isolates obtained in mesoendemic southern
Vietnam in 1996. MSP-1 alleles were characterized by combining PCR typing with
allele-specific primers and partial DNA sequencing. The following single-copy
microsatellite markers were typed : Polyalpha, TA42 (only for Brazilian samples),
TA81, TA1, TA87, TA109 (only for Brazilian samples), 2490, ARAII, PfG377, PfPK2, 
and TA60.
RESULTS: The low pair-wise average genetic distance between microsatellite
haplotypes of isolates sharing identical MSP-1 alleles indicates that epidemic
propagation of discrete parasite clones originated most identical MSP-1 alleles
in parasite populations from Brazil and Vietnam. At least one epidemic clone
propagating in Brazil remained relatively unchanged over more than one decade.
Moreover, we found no evidence that rearrangements of MSP-1 repeats, putatively
created by mitotic recombination events, generated new alleles within clonal
lineages of parasites in either country.
CONCLUSION: Identical MSP-1 alleles originated from co-ancestry in both
populations, whereas nearly identical MSP-1 alleles have probably appeared
independently in unrelated parasite lineages.

Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris, 46 rue Henri Huchard, 75877 Paris Cedex 18, France.

In south-eastern Iran, the sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) combination has been
used to treat malaria caused by chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum. To
explore the molecular basis of antimalarial resistance in this region, the dhfr, 
dhps and pfcrt genes of 50 clinical isolates of P. falciparum, collected from
cases of uncomplicated malaria in 2000-2001, were checked for the point mutations
that appear associated with SP or chloroquine (CQ) resistance. The results of the
study, which was based on a PCR followed by DNA sequencing, indicated that all 50
isolates presented the DHFR S108N mutation associated with pyrimethamine
resistance. Seven isolates (14%) had a triple DHFR mutation (S108N, N51I, C59R)
and 32 (64%) had a double mutation in this domain. Thirty-nine isolates (78%) had
the wild-type DHFR 51 codon but only 15 (30%) had the wild-type DHFR 59 codon.
Eleven isolates (22%) only had the DHFR S108N mutation. All isolates had the
wild-type DHPS 436 and 540 codons and all but two of the isolates had the
wild-type DHPS 437 codon. All isolates but one had the PFCRT K76T mutation
associated with CQ treatment failure. The results of this preliminary
investigation indicate that SP may remain the treatment of choice for cases of
uncomplicated malaria in south-eastern Iran.

AIM: To compare and analyze the homology of genes encoding histidine-rich
proteinII (HRPII) of different Plasmodium falciparum isolates.
METHODS: Using PCR technique, the complete genes coding for HRPII of P.
falciparum isolates FCC1/HN and VN isolates were amplified. PCR products were
digested by HindIII/BamHI and cloned into plasmid pUC19. The recombinant plasmid 
HRPII/pUC19 was screened and identified by PCR and restriction analysis. The
cloned HRPII genes were sequenced by Sanger's method.
RESULTS: HRPII genes of FCC1/HN and VN isolates were successfully amplified and
cloned into pUC19. DNA sequencing showed that the coding length of HRPII gene was
1,020 bp without introns in FCC1/HN and VN isolates, however, there were ten
points mutations between them. FCC1/HN isolate exhibited 98.8%, 92.2% and 98.7%
homology in amino acids with isolates VN, IMTM22, and Itg2, respectively. Though 
the numbers of repeat sequences were different in four isolates, they had the
same hydrophobic leader sequence and a single putative glycosylation site. The
secondary structure analysis showed that the main antigenic determinants of four 
isolates were located on 5' end non-repeat region (amino acids 1-60).
CONCLUSION: FCC1/HN isolate was highly homologous in the coding region of HRPII
with VN, IMTM22, and Itg2 isolate. Four isolates exhibited similar structural
characteristics and antigenic determinants in HRPII.

Plasmodium vivax malaria re-emerged in South Korea in 1993, and epidemics
continue since then. We examined genetic variation in the region encompassing the
apical membrane antigen-1 (PvAMA-1) of the parasites by DNA sequencing of the 22 
re-emerging P. vivax isolates. The genotype of the PvAMA-1, which was based on
sequence data previously reported for the polymorphic regions, showed that two
haplotypes were present at one polymorphic site. Compared with reported data, the
two types, SKOR type I and type II, were similar to Chinese CH-10A and CH-05A
isolates, respectively. Thus, the present study showed that two genotypes of
AMA-1 genes coexist in the re-emerging Korean P. vivax.

Gammadelta T cells are implicated to play crucial roles during early immune
responses to pathogens. A subset of human gammadelta T cells carrying the
Vgamma9Vdelta2 TCR recognize small, phosphorylated nonpeptidic Ags. However, the 
precise role of these cells and the ligands recognized in human immune responses 
against pathogens remains unclear because of the lack of suitable animal models. 
We have analyzed the reactivity of spleen cells of the New World monkey Aotus
nancymaae against isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP), a phosphorylated microbial
metabolite selectively activating Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells. Spleen cells were
stimulated by IPP and the expanding cell population expressed the Vgamma9 TCR.
TRGV-J and TRDV-D-J rearrangements expressed by IPP-stimulated cells of Aotus
were analyzed by RT-PCR and DNA sequencing. The TRGV-J and TRDV-D-J
rearrangements expressed by IPP-stimulated Aotus and human gammadelta T cells
were similar with respect to 1) TCR gene segment usage, 2) a high degree of
germline sequence homology of the TCR gene segments used, and 3) the diversity of
the CDR3 regions. Phylogenetic analysis of human, Pan troglodytes, and A.
nancymaae TRGV gene segments showed that the interspecies differences are smaller
than the intraspecies differences with TRGV9 gene segments located on a distinct 
clade of the phylogenetic tree. The structural and functional conservation of
Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells in A. nancymaae and humans implicates a functionally
important and evolutionary conserved mechanism of recognition of phosphorylated
microbial metabolites.

Direct automated DNA sequencing was used to analyze exons 2 and 3 of HLA-B
alleles present in forty-four unrelated individuals residing in the village of
Adiopodoume, Côte d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast). Of the 23 HLA-B alleles observed, the
most frequently detected allele was HLA-B*5301 (22.7%), which is believed to
confer resistance to severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria. B*4501 (9.1%), B*1503 
(8.0%), B*0705 (5.7%), B*1510 (5.7%) and B*3501 (5.7%) occurred frequently in the
population. A second allele of B53 was identified; B*5302 contains a single amino
acid variation at residue 171 (Y-->H). Two additional novel alleles, B* 1405 (a
single amino acid variant of B*1402) and B*4410 (a five amino acid variant of
B*4403) were characterized.

Complement receptor 1 (CR1) has been implicated in rosetting of uninfected red
blood cells to Plasmodium falciparum-infected cells, and rosette formation is
associated with severe malaria. The Knops blood group (KN) is located on CR1 and 
some of these antigens, ie, McCoy (McC) and Swain-Langley (Sl(a)), show marked
frequency differences between Caucasians and Africans. Thus, defining the
molecular basis of these antigens may provide new insight into the mechanisms of 
P falciparum malaria. Monoclonal antibody epitope mapping and serologic
inhibition studies using CR1 deletion constructs localized McC and Sl(a) to long 
homologous repeat D of CR1. Direct DNA sequencing of selected donors identified
several single nucleotide polymorphisms in exon 29 coding for complement control 
protein modules 24 and 25. Two of these appeared to be blood group specific: McC 
associated with K1590E and Sl(a) with R1601G. These associations were confirmed
by inhibition studies using allele-specific mutants. A sequence-specific
oligonucleotide probe hybridization assay was developed to genotype several
African populations and perform family inheritance studies. Concordance between
the 1590 mutation and McC was 94%; that between Sl(a) and 1601 was 88%. All but 2
samples exhibiting discrepancies between the genotype and phenotype were found to
be due to low red cell CR1 copy numbers, low or absent expression of some
alleles, or heterozygosity combined with low normal levels of CR1. These data
further explain the variability observed in previous serologic studies of CR1 and
show that DNA and protein-based genetic studies will be needed to clarify the
role of the KN antigens in malaria.

A bifunctional dihydrofolate synthetase--folylpolyglutamate synthetase in
Plasmodium falciparum identified by functional complementation in yeast and
bacteria.

Folate metabolism in the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum is an
essential activity for cell growth and replication, and the target of an
important class of therapeutic agents in widespread use. However, resistance to
antifolate drugs is a major health problem in the developing world. To date, only
two activities in this complex pathway have been targeted by antimalarials. To
more fully understand the mechanisms of antifolate resistance and to identify
promising targets for new chemotherapies, we have cloned genes encoding as yet
uncharacterised enzymes in this pathway. By means of complementation experiments 
using 1-carbon metabolism mutants of both Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces
cerevisiae, we demonstrate here that one of these parasite genes encodes both
dihydrofolate synthetase (DHFS) and folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS)
activities, which catalyse the synthesis and polyglutamation of folate
derivatives, respectively. The malaria parasite is the first known example of a
eukaryote encoding both DHFS and FPGS activities in a single gene. DNA sequencing
of this gene in antifolate-resistant strains of P. falciparum, as well as
drug-inhibition assays performed on yeast and bacteria expressing PfDHFS--FPGS,
indicate that current antifolate regimes do not target this enzyme. As
PfDHFS--FPGS harbours two activities critical to folate metabolism, one of which 
has no human counterpart, this gene product offers a novel chemotherapeutic
target with the potential to deliver a powerful blockage to parasite growth.

Conservation and heterogeneity of the glutamate-rich protein (GLURP) among field

DK-2300 CopenhagenS, Denmark.

Genetic variation of the glutamate-rich protein (GLURP) of Plasmodium falciparum 
was analysed in 29 field isolates and 15 laboratory lines of diverse geographical
origin, by DNA sequencing of the non-repetitive 5'-region (R0) of the glurp gene.
Polymorphism with respect to the length of the GLURP R2 repeat region was also
analysed by a polymerase chain reaction method. As reference, the nucleotide
sequence of the highly polymorphic 3'-region of the circumsporozoite protein gene
was determined in the same isolates. It was found that even in the presence of
variations in the GLURP R2 repeat region, immunodominant parts of the GLURP R0
region are surprisingly well conserved and the conservation is most pronounced in
isolates from locations with very high malaria transmission. This might indicate 
that the R0 structure plays an important role in the parasite.

To date, little has been known about the extent of sequence variation in the
C-terminal part of the Plasmodium vivax merozoite surface protein 1 (PvMSP1)
which has been considered to be a potential vaccine candidate. Here, we examined 
the variation in the region encompassing interspecies conserved blocks (ICBs) 8
and 10 of PvMSP1 by DNA sequencing of 14 Thai isolates and three Brazilian
isolates. Eighteen different alleles were detected. Three new sequence types had 
been identified in polymorphic region between ICB8 and CB9: one was possibly a
result of intragenic recombination between the Belem and Salvador I alleles and
the others displayed unique repeats. A striking variation was observed in a
stretch of 38 codons in polymorphic block between conserved block CB9 and ICB10, 
resulting in eight different sequence types, probably generated by interallelic
recombination at a single or multiple sites. There is no apparent linkage between
these two polymorphic sites. On the other hand, a single or stretches of
nucleotide substitutions are dimorphic like in Plasmodium falciparum MSP1
(PfMSP1) in the remaining parts, creating microheterogeneity of sequences. The
C-terminal 19 kDa-encoding region was extremely conserved with a single dimorphic
exchange at a known position. Thus, this study provides evidence of intragenic
recombination occurring in the 3' portion of PvMSP1 and suggests that the 3'
portion of PvMSP1 is more diverse than that in PfMSP1.

OBJECTIVE: To provide the scientific evidence for designing safe and effective
vaccines of human cerebral malaria.
METHODS: Genomic DNA samples of two isolated Plasmodium falciparum isolate
strains prepared directly from 5 cases of cerebral malaria patients' blood in
mengla County, Yunnan Province (CMH/YN) and in Yingjiang County, Yunnan Province 
(CYJ/YN) were used for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and the two 
pairs of oligonucleotides for the highly conserved genes encoding FC27 merozoite 
surface protein 2 (MSP2) of Papua New Guinea strain of Plasmodium falciparum were
used as primers. The PCR products were digested with BamH1 and Hind III
respectively, and the generated fragment MSP2 were cloned into M13mp18 and
M13mp19 vectors and their DNA was analyzed as the templates for DNA sequencing by
the dideoxy chain-termination method.
RESULTS: Compared with the published findings, FC27, K1, IC1 and CAMP sequences, 
DNA sequences of MSP2 from two isolated CMH/YN and CYJ/YN of Plasmodium
falciparum strains from Chinese patients with cerebral malaria contained
identical genes composed of 800 bp, encoding 264 amino acid, which were highly
homologous up to 98.8% with that of FC27, K1 strain other than the IC1, CAMP
strain.
CONCLUSION: It is the first record of DNA sequencing of MSP2 determined from two 
isolated CMH/YN and CYJ/YN of Plasmodium falciparum strains from Chinese patients
with cerebral malaria, MSP2 mutation may be one factor leading to the localized
cerebral damage which causes clinical coma of human cerebral malaria.

Recherche sur le Paludisme, Organisation de Coordination pour la lutte contre les
Endémies en Afrique Centrale, Yaounde, Cameroon.

A novel Plasmodium falciparum gene, denoted cg2 gene, has been recently
discovered, and a distinct genotype, characterized by 12 point mutations and 3
size polymorphisms, has been shown to be associated with chloroquine resistance
in laboratory-adapted parasite strains. One of the polymorphic regions, denoted
the omega region, consists of 16 tandem repeat units in chloroquine-resistant
strains, while the chloroquine-sensitive strains have either < or = 15 or > or = 
17 repeat units. In this study, the in vivo and in vitro responses were compared 
with the number of repeat units in the omega region of the cg2 gene for 75
Cameroonian isolates determined either by DNA sequencing or agarose gel
electrophoresis. The 16-repeat units that characterize the resistant strains were
found in 10 chloroquine-sensitive isolates (50% inhibitory concentration [IC50] <
100 nM) and 30 chloroquine-resistant isolates (IC50 > or = 100 nM). Thirty-five
isolates (28 chloroquine-sensitive isolates and 7 chloroquine-resistant isolates)
displayed < or = 15 or > or = 17 repeat units. Of the 18 patients responding with
treatment failure, 15 were infected with parasites carrying 16 repeat units.
Twenty-eight patients (11 with isolates carrying 16 repeat units and 17 with
isolates carrying < or = 15 or > or = 17 repeat units) showed an adequate
clinical response. The sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value were 81%
(83%), 74% (61%), and 75% (58%), respectively compared with in vitro (or in vivo)
responses. Neither the level of IC50 nor the key P. falciparum multidrug
resistance gene 1 (pfmdr 1) allele at position 86 was associated with the number 
of omega repeat units. Although in vitro and in vivo resistance to chloroquine
was statistically associated with the presence of 16 repeat units in the omega
region (P < 0.05), the number of omega repeat units did not adequately
discriminate patients infected with chloroquine-resistant parasites from those
infected with chloroquine-sensitive parasites. Further studies on the cg2 gene
are needed to determine whether cg2 gene is a reliable genetic marker for
chloroquine resistance.

In Europe 64 cases of airport malaria have been registered between 1969 and 1996,
most of them in France, Switzerland and Belgium. In the summer of 1995 six cases 
of airport malaria occurred at the International airport of Brussels, Belgium. Of
the six patients three were airport employees, three were occasional visitors.
One patient died, the diagnosis was made by PCR amplification and DNA sequencing 
after exhumation. Two different species of Plasmodium were detected, and
infections occurred on at least two different floors of the airport. An inquiry
revealed that the cabin of airplanes is correctly sprayed, according to WHO
recommendations, but that the inside of the hand luggage, the cargo hold, the
animal compartment, the wheel bays and container flights remain possible shelters
for infected mosquitoes. In a case of fever of unknown origin, airport malaria
should be considered in the differential diagnosis, especially during hot
summers, and when thrombocytopenia is present. Additional antimosquito measures
should be generalised, encompassing highly exposed personnel, container content
and handling buildings, animal cages, wheel bays, and the boundary between the
sorting and the reception of luggage.

Coopération (ORSTOM), Yaoundé, Cameroon. oceac@camnet.cm

In vitro sulfadoxine and pyrimethamine resistance has been associated with point 
mutations in the dihydropteroate synthase and dihydrofolate reductase domains,
respectively, but the in vivo relevance of these point mutations has not been
well established. To analyze the correlation between genotype and phenotype, 10
Cameroonian adult patients were treated with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and
followed up for 28 days. After losses to follow-up (n = 1) or elimination of DNA 
samples due to mixed parasite populations with pyrimethamine-sensitive and
pyrimethamine-resistant profiles (n = 3), parasite genomic DNA from day 0 blood
samples of six patients were analyzed by DNA sequencing. Three patients who were 
cured had isolates characterized by a wild-type or mutant dihydrofolate reductase
gene (with one or two mutations) and wild-type dihydropteroate synthase gene.
Three other patients who failed to respond to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine treatment
carried isolates with triple dihydrofolate reductase gene mutations and either a 
wild-type or a mutant dihydropteroate synthase gene. Three dihydrofolate
reductase gene codons (51, 59, and 108) may be reliable genetic markers that can 
accurately predict the clinical outcome of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine treatment in
Africa.

Cycle DNA sequencing with [alpha-35S]dATP demonstrates polymorphism of a surface 
antigen in malaria parasites from Sri Lankan patients.

Structural diversity in a 45 kDa surface antigen on Plasmodium falciparum
merozoites (termed GYMSSA, MSP-2 or MSA-2) and other candidate molecules for
developing a malaria vaccine need to be investigated in parasites obtained
directly from patients in different malaria endemic countries. A double-stranded 
DNA sequencing method suitable for this purpose, and also for studying diversity 
in genes of other haploid cells, is described. A first round polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) on DNA isolated from blood was carried out with a primer
containing the GCN4 binding site to amplify and subsequently purify the coding
region of the MSA-2 gene on GCN4 coated tubes. A second round PCR with more
internal primers incorporating M13 forward and reverse primer sequences was then 
performed. Cycle sequencing was done with unlabelled M13 primers and
[alpha-35S]dATP by the dideoxynucleotide procedure. Two different allelic forms
of MSA-2 were identified in samples of Plasmodium falciparum from patients in Sri
Lanka.

The merozoite surface protein 1 gene of Plasmodium vivax (PvMSP-1) is becoming a 
solid genetic marker for studying the polymorphism of natural parasite
populations from this prevalent human malaria. Indeed, a conserved and a variant 
PvMSP-1 gene segments have been amplified from total genomic parasite DNA
obtained from isolates representing seven countries and three continents.
Interestingly, the variant PvMSP-1 gene segment contains two highly conserved
parental allele forms capable of limited genetic exchange at the sexual stage in 
the mosquito vector. This variant PvMSP-1 gene segment was amplified from 18
Colombian isolates to try to determine whether the same two parental allele forms
were also present in this geographical area. Southern blot and DNA sequencing
analyses confirmed their existence among the Colombian isolates. Moreover,
expression of these two allele forms as recombinant proteins allowed us to
demonstrate for the first time that this PvMSP-1 gene segment codes for amino
acid sequences that are exposed on the surface of P. vivax schizonts and that are
immunogenic in natural infections.

Polyclonal expansion of peripheral gamma delta T cells in human Plasmodium
falciparum malaria.

Plasmodium falciparum malaria in humans is associated with an increase in the
percentage and absolute number of gamma delta T cells in the peripheral blood.
This increase begins during the acute infection phase and persists for at least 4
weeks during convalescence. In the present study, 25 to 30% of the gamma delta T 
cells expressed HLA-DR antigens in vivo and in some patients they proliferated in
response to further stimulation by purified human interleukin 2 in vitro.
However, there was no in vitro proliferative response to various malarial
antigens, including a 75-kDa heat shock protein and a 72-kDa glucose-regulated
protein of P. falciparum during the acute infection phase. Cytofluorographic
studies showed that although an increase of V delta 1- gamma delta T cells was
largely responsible for the expansion of the total number of gamma delta T cells,
there was also a proportional increase in V delta 1+ cells. These results were
confirmed with anchored PCR and by DNA sequencing to characterize at the
molecular level the set of T-cell receptor (TCR) delta mRNAs expressed in the
peripheral blood of two patients with high levels of gamma delta T cells. In each
case, most of the TCR delta mRNA transcripts corresponded to nonproductively
rearranged delta genes (unrearranged J delta or near J delta spliced to C delta).
In those sequences which did represent productively rearranged genes, most of the
transcripts originated from a V delta 2/J delta 1 joining, as in normal
individuals. A minority of transcripts originated from a V delta 1/J delta 1
rearrangement, and one originated from a V alpha 4/J delta 1 rearrangement.
Polyclonal activation of gamma delta T cells was inferred from the extensive
junctional diversity seen in the delta mRNAs analyzed. Expansion of a
heterogeneous set of both V delta 1(-)- and V delta 1(+)-bearing T cells suggests
that the elevated levels of gamma delta T cells seen during acute P. falciparum
malaria arose from immune responses to multiple distinct parasite antigens or
unidentified host factors.

The Plasmodium falciparum gene encoding erythrocyte binding antigen-175
(EBA-175), a putative receptor for red cell invasion (Camus, D., and T. J.
Hadley. 1985. Science (Wash. DC). 230:553-556.), has been isolated and
characterized. DNA sequencing demonstrated a single open reading frame encoding a
translation product of 1,435 amino acid residues. Peptides corresponding to
regions on the deduced amino acid sequence predicted to be B cell epitopes were
assessed for immunogenicity. Immunization of mice and rabbits with EBA-peptide 4,
a synthetic peptide encompassing amino acid residues 1,062-1,103, produced
antibodies that recognized P. falciparum merozoites in an indirect fluorescent
antibody assay. When compared to sera from rabbits immunized with the same
adjuvant and carrier protein, sera from rabbits immunized with EBA-peptide 4
inhibited merozoite invasion of erythrocytes in vitro by 80% at a 1:5 dilution.
Furthermore, these sera inhibited the binding of purified, authentic EBA-175 to
erythrocytes, suggesting that their activity in inhibiting merozoite invasion of 
erythrocytes is mediated by blocking the binding of EBA-175 to erythrocytes.
Since the nucleotide sequence of EBA-peptide 4 is conserved among seven strains
of P. falciparum from throughout the world (Sim, B. K. L. 1990. Mol. Biochem.
Parasitol. 41:293-296.), these data identify a region of the protein that should 
be a focus of vaccine development efforts.

As a consequence of gene cloning and DNA sequencing several gene families are
emerging in the field of cell-cell recognition. These include immunoglobulins,
integrins, certain extracellular glycoproteins and a family of functionally
unrelated proteins which include factor B. We report here the cloning and
sequencing of a gene from Plasmodium falciparum, coding for a protein we call
thrombospondin related anonymous protein (TRAP), which shares certain sequence
motifs common to other well-characterized proteins. The most significant homology
is based around the sequence Trp-Ser-Pro-Cys-Ser-Val-Thr-Cys-Gly (WSPCSVTCG),
present in three copies in region I of thrombospondin (TSP), six copies in
properdin (P) and one copy in all the circumsporozoite (CS) proteins sequenced so
far. TRAP also shares with certain extracellular glycoproteins, including TSP,
the cell-recognition signal Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD), which has been shown to be crucial
in the interaction of several extracellular glycoproteins with members of the
integrin superfamily. Unlike the CS protein, TRAP is expressed during the
erythrocytic stage of the parasite life cycle.

Plasmodium falciparum: molecular analysis of a putative protective antigen, the
thermostable 96-kDa protein.

A group of three Plasmodium falciparum antigens of distinct pI, migrating with an
apparent MW of 96 kDa has been previously identified as a target of protective
immunity both in humans and in monkeys (Jouin et al. 1987, Dubois et al. 1987).
These antigens are produced during the late stages of asexual intraerythrocytic
development. One of these 96-kDa proteins, the 96 tR, has a pI of 5.25, is
thermostable, and is released in the culture supernatant (Jouin et al. 1987). We 
report here the cloning and expression in Escherichia coli of the gene coding for
this antigen. Antibodies raised to the recombinant 96 tR immunoprecipitated
exclusively the 96 tR, indicating that the other two antigens of 96 kDa are the
product(s) of distinct gene(s). Northern and Southern blots as well as DNA
sequencing of the gene showed that the 96 tR antigen is identical to proteins
identified in other laboratories as the glycophorin binding protein GBP 130
(Perkins 1984, Ravetch et al. 1985) and Ag 78 (Bianco et al. 1987). The 96-kDa
antigen is produced at the trophozoite stage and more actively in the schizonts. 
It is released in the culture supernatant at the time of schizont rupture,
together with two minor products, forming a characteristic triplet. This triplet 
was also detected in immunoblots of merozoites. An approximate quantification on 
immunoblots indicated that the largest proportion of the protein is found in the 
culture supernatant, a minor fraction being loosely associated with merozoites.
By immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy, intense signals were
observed in the erythrocyte cytoplasm. The 50-amino acid repeats were found in
all strains examined, the protein showing some size polymorphism. The antigen was
detected in the serum of infected monkeys as well as in that of infected humans.
