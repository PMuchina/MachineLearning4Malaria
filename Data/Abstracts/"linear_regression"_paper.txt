Background: Beta (β)-endorphins are endogenous neuropeptides found in the plasma 
and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of humans but there have been reports of the
relationship between the plasma and CSF β-endorphin levels in different clinical 
conditions. However, the relationship between β-endorphin levels in the plasma
and CSF of children with cerebral malaria (CM) has not been reported.
Aim: To determine the relationship between β-endorphin levels in the CSF and
plasma of children with CM.
Settings and Design: This cross-sectional study involved 40 children, aged
between 6 months and 14 years, admitted with a diagnosis of CM at the Obafemi
Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex (OAUTHC), Ile-Ife, Nigeria.
Materials and Methods: One milliliter (mL) of venous blood and 1mL of CSF
obtained from each subject at admission were used to determine the β-endorphin
levels using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method.
Statistical Analysis: Bivariate linear regression was used to determine the
association between plasma and CSF β-endorphin levels using the correlation
coefficient (r), coefficient of determination (R 2), and P values.
Results: The plasma β-endorphin levels significantly positively correlated with
CSF β-endorphin (r = 0.568, P = 0.001) such that for every unit rise in plasma
β-endorphin, CSF β-endorphin rose by 0.252 pmol/L (confidence interval:
0.132-0.371 pmol/L).
Conclusion: The finding of positive correlation between plasma and CSF
β-endorphin levels in this study suggests a possible direct link between plasma
and CSF in CM, probably from the disruption of the blood-brain barrier that has
been reported in CM.

A highly sensitive diagnostic system for determining low-density infections that 
are missed by conventional methods is necessary to detect the carriers of
Plasmodium falciparum. A fluorescent blue-ray optical system with a polycarbonate
scan disc was developed to detect P. falciparum-infected red blood cells
(Pf-iRBCs), and nine samples could be analyzed simultaneously. The cultured P.
falciparum strain 3D7 was used to examine the potential of the system for
diagnosing malaria. After an RBC suspension had been applied to the disc, the
cells were dispersed on the disc by rotation. During the 10 min standing period
to allow the RBCs to settle on the disc surface, the cells were simultaneously
stained with nuclear fluorescence staining dye Hoechst 34580, which was
previously adsorbed on the disc surface. RBCs were arranged on the disc surface
as a monolayer by removing excess cells through momentary rotation. Over 1.1
million RBCs remained on the disc for fluorescence analysis. A portable,
battery-driven fluorescence image reader was employed to detect
fluorescence-positive RBCs for approximately 40 min. A good correlation between
examination of Giemsa-stained RBCs by light microscopy and the developed system
was demonstrated in the parasitemia range of 0.0001-1.0% by linear regression
analysis (R2 = 0.99993). The limit of detection of 0.00020% and good
reproducibility for parasitemia determination were observed. The ability of the
developed system to detect sub-microscopic low-density Pf-iRBCs and provide
accurate quantitative evaluation with easy operation was demonstrated.

BACKGROUND: Systemic inflammation, platelet dysfunction, and endothelial
activation persist in people living with HIV despite sustained virologic
suppression (SVS) with combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) and may lead to
complications such as atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. Angiopoietin-1 
(Ang-1) is a key regulator of angiogenesis and endothelial activation and has
been studied as an objective biomarker in disease states such as atherosclerosis,
sepsis, and severe malaria.
SETTING: Eight pediatric HIV care centers across Canada.
METHODS: Cross-sectional study of 61 children living with vertically acquired HIV
on cART with undetectable RNA viral load. Plasma levels of Ang-1 were measured by
ELISA and analyzed in relation to clinical characteristics abstracted from
medical records.
RESULTS: Ang-1 levels were directly correlated with clinical indices of virologic
control: cumulative proportion of life on effective cART (ρ = +0.35, P = 0.0078) 
and cumulative proportion of life with SVS (ρ = +0.36, P = 0.0049). Furthermore, 
higher Ang-1 levels were associated with younger age at SVS (ρ = -0.56, P <
0.0001). These associations remained statistically significant in multivariable
linear regression models adjusting for potential confounders (P < 0.05 for all
associations).
CONCLUSIONS: Early effective cART and SVS were associated with higher Ang-1
levels in children living with vertically acquired HIV-1.

It is important to assess whether regional progress toward achieving the
millennium development goals (MDGs) has contributed to human development and
whether this has had an effect on the triple burden of disease in the continent. 
This analysis investigates the association between the human development index
(HDI) and co-occurrence of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis (TB), and malaria as measured
by MDG 6 indicators in 35 selected sub-Saharan African countries from 2000 to
2014. The analysis used secondary data from the United Nations Development
Programme data repository for HDI and disease data from WHO Global Health
observatory data repository. Generalized Linear Regression Models were used to
analyze relationships between HDI and MDG 6 indicators. HDI was observed to
improve from 2001 to 2014, and this varied across the selected sub-regions. There
was a significant positive relationship between HDI and HIV prevalence in East
Africa (β = 0.048 [95% CI: 0.040-0.056], p < 0.001) and Southern Africa (β =
0.032 [95% CI: 0.002-0.062], p = 0.034). A significant positive relationship was 
observed with TB incidence (β = 0.009 [95% CI: 0.003-0.015], p = 0.002) and a
significant negative relationship was observed with malaria incidence (β = -0.020
(95% CI: -0.029 to -0.010, p < 0.001) in East Africa. Observed improvements in
HDI from the year 2000 to 2014 did not translate into commensurate progress in
MDG 6 goals.

The standard membrane-feeding assay (SMFA) is a functional assay that has been
used to inform the development of transmission-blocking vaccines (TBV) against
Plasmodium falciparum malaria. For Pfs230, a lead target antigen for TBV
development, a few studies have tested either a single anti-Pfs230 polyclonal or 
monoclonal antibody (one antibody per study) at serial dilutions and showed a
dose-dependent response. Further, there have been reports that the SMFA activity 
of anti-Pfs230 polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies were enhanced in the presence
of complement. However, no analysis has been performed with multiple samples, and
the impact of anti-Pfs230 antibody titers, IgG subclass profile and avidity were 
evaluated together in relation to transmission-reducing activity (TRA) by SMFA.
In this report, a total of 39 unique anti-Pfs230 IgGs from five different mouse
immunization studies were assessed for their ELISA units (EU), IgG2/IgG1 ratio
and avidity by ELISA, and the functionality (% transmission-reducing activity,
%TRA) by SMFA. The mice were immunized with Pfs230 alone, Pfs230 conjugated to
CRM197, or a mixture of unconjugated Pfs230 and CRM197 proteins using Alhydrogel 
or Montanide ISA720 adjuvants. In all studies, the Pfs230 antigen was from the
same source. There was a significant correlation between EU and %TRA (p < 0.0001 
by a Spearman rank test) for the anti-Pfs230 IgGs. Notably, multiple linear
regression analyses showed that both IgG2/IgG1 ratio and avidity significantly
affected %TRA (p = 0.003 to p = 0.014, depending on the models) after adjusting
for EU. The results suggest that in addition to antibody titers, IgG2/IgG1 ratio 
and avidity should each be evaluated to predict the biological activity of
anti-Pfs230 antibodies for future vaccine development.

We aimed to investigate life-course factors associated with blood pressure (BP)
among Ugandan adolescents. Between 9th April 2003 and 24th November 2005, 2507
pregnant women from Entebbe municipality and Katabi sub-county were enrolled into
a deworming trial. The resulting 2345 live-born offspring were followed to age 10
or 11 years, when between 20th May 2014 to 16th June 2016, BP was measured
following standard protocols. Factors associated with BP were assessed using
multivariable linear regression. BP was measured in 1119 adolescents with a
median age of 10.2 years. Mean systolic BP and diastolic BP was 105.9 mmHg
(standard deviation (SD) 8.2) and 65.2 mmHg (SD 7.3), respectively. Maternal
gestational body mass index (BMI), higher maternal education status and family
history of hypertension were positively associated with adolescent BP. Childhood 
(age ≤5 years) malaria was associated with lower adolescent systolic BP. Factors 
measured at time of BP measurement positively associated with systolic BP were
age, BMI, waist circumference and Trichuris trichiura (whipworm) infection;
higher vegetable consumption was associated with lower systolic BP. Results for
diastolic BP were similar, except higher fruit, rather than higher vegetable
consumption was associated with lower diastolic BP and there was no association
with waist circumference or Trichuris trichiura infection. In summary,
life-course exposures were associated with adolescent BP in this tropical birth
cohort. Malaria early in life could impact later BP. Interventions initiated
early in life targeting individuals with family history of hypertension, aiming
to reduce adiposity (in pregnancy and adolescence) and promoting fruit and
vegetable consumption might contribute to reducing the risk of high BP and
subsequent cardiovascular diseases.

Serum ferritin concentration is the preferred biomarker to assess population iron
status in the absence of inflammation. Interpretation of this biomarker is
complicated in populations with a high burden of infection, however, because
inflammation increases serum ferritin concentration independently of iron status.
We aimed to compare estimates of iron status of Kenyan pregnant women, with
circulating ferritin concentrations adjusted for inflammation using newly
proposed methods by the BRINDA project, or using previously proposed adjustment
methods. We re-analyzed data from pregnant Kenyan women living in a rural area
where malaria is highly endemic (n = 470) or in an urban area (n = 402). As
proposed by the BRINDA group, we adjusted individual ferritin concentration by
internal regression for circulating concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP)
and α₁-acid glycoprotein (AGP). Other adjustment methods comprised: (a)
arithmetic correction factors based on CRP or AGP; (b) exclusion of subjects with
inflammation (CRP >5 mg/L or AGP >1 g/L); and (c) higher ferritin cut-off value
(<30 μg/L). We additionally adjusted for Plasmodium infection as appropriate.
Lastly, we assessed iron status without adjustment for inflammation. All
correction methods increased prevalence of iron deficiency compared to the
unadjusted estimates. This increase was more pronounced with the internal
regression correction method. The iron deficiency prevalence estimate increased
from 53% to 87% in rural Kisumu study and from 30% to 41% in the urban Nairobi
study after adjusting for inflammation (CRP and AGP) using the BRINDA internal
regression method. When we corrected for both inflammation and Plasmodium
infection using the regression correction, it resulted in lower prevalence
estimates compared to uninfected women. Application of linear regression methods 
to adjust circulating ferritin concentration for inflammation leads to markedly
decreased point estimates for ferritin concentration and increased estimates for 
the prevalence of iron deficiency in pregnancy.

Purpose: Malaria has been one of a major infectious parasitic disease in Nepal.
Although the number of cases is gradually getting declined since last decade.
Therefore, study aims to identify the trends and spatial patterns of malaria
among 25 risk districts of Nepal.
Materials and Methods: This study utilized the secondary data of malaria cases
from the annual reports (2001-2017) of Department of Health Services, Ministry of
Health and Population of Nepal. Linear regression of log-transformed incidence
rates model was used for assessing variation of malaria cases for year and
districts.
Results: There was evidence of decrease in the trend of malaria (2001-2009);
however, the upward trend was revealed in 2010, after that, it starts to decline 
and again in 2017, it started to grow up. The malaria cases were marked
variations by location with higher rates occurring in Dadeldhura, Kanchanpur,
Kailali, Bardiya, and Jhapa districts, respectively.
Conclusion: In this regards, malaria cases are still causing the threat in the
Terai district of Nepal; however, there were fluctuating patterns of disease
noted during the study periods.

OBJECTIVE: Maternal anaemia in early pregnancy is associated with poor pregnancy 
outcomes. Furthermore, preconceptional health can influence the health during
pregnancy. The aim of this study was to investigate which preconceptional factors
were associated with haemoglobin (Hb) concentration in early pregnancy.
METHODS: In Tanzania, 226 women were followed at preconception and during early
pregnancy. Red blood cell (RBC) morphology, serum micronutrient concentration,
demographic characteristics and health status were assessed in preconception and 
in early pregnancy. The association between preconceptional factors and Hb
concentration in early pregnancy was investigated using simple and multiple
linear regression analyses stratified by preconceptional anaemia status.
RESULTS: Mean Hb was 123 and 119 g/l before conception and during early pregnancy
(median gestational age 53 days) respectively. Preconceptional mid-upper arm
circumference (MUAC) (adjusted coefficient (AC) 0.35 95% CI 0.9-0.61) and
preconceptional Hb concentration (AC 0.45 95% CI 0.36-0.54) were positively
associated with early pregnancy Hb concentration, whereas preconceptional
microcytic hypochromic RBC morphology (AC -6.00 95% CI -9.56 to -2.44) was
negatively associated with early pregnancy Hb concentration. In addition,
treatment of preconceptional malaria was positively associated with early
pregnancy Hb concentration (AC 6.45 95% CI 0.74-12.2) among women with
preconceptional anaemia. In contrast, among preconceptional non-anaemic women,
only preconceptional Hb concentration and medium socio-economic status was
positively associated with early pregnancy Hb concentration.
CONCLUSIONS: Mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) and Hb measurements in
preconception can help to detect women at increased risk of low Hb concentration 
in early pregnancy.

BACKGROUND: Malaria, one of the World's biggest billers' is on the schedule for
biomedical research and public health policies. The introduction of the
artemisinin, a Chinese traditional drug from Artemisia annua is a revolution in
the treatment of malaria. Artemisinin-based combination treatment (ACT) is
considered to be the best strategy for uncomplicated Falciparum malaria. The
presence of 1,2,4-trioxane system in artemisinin is responsible for its
antimalarial activity.
METHODS: In this study, twenty-nine analogues of artemisinin were taken into
account for QSAR studies along with artemisinin. The most active analogue of
artemisinin 21 was energy minimized. All the structures were prepared from the
active conformer 21 and energy was minimized to the stable state using MMFF94
force field using ChemBioDraw-12. Genetic Algorithm is used to decide the
descriptors best required for the model generation. The test set and training set
division were done by using hierarchal clustering module available with NCSS
statistical software.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The antimalarial activity of the artemisinin and its
substituted analogues has been analyzed through the multiple linear regression
(MLR) using various physiochemical and structural descriptors obtained from PADEL
software. The models were prepared using the Sigma Plot version 11. The
calculated 2D autocorrelation descriptors and the MLR model suggest that

BACKGROUND: Despite its elimination in the early 1950s, about 1700 cases of
malaria are reported in the US every year. Few studies have quantified the direct
and indirect costs of imported malaria in the US.
METHODS: Disparities in the mean and total hospital days, hospital charges, and
hospital costs for malaria-related hospitalizations in the US by demographic,
clinical, species, financial, geographic, and institutional characteristics were 
examined using the 2000-2014 Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS). Trends and
potential predictors for length of stay and hospital charges and costs were
identified using negative binomial regression and linear regression,
respectively.
RESULTS: From 2000 to 2014, 22,029 malaria cases resulted in 95,948 hospital days
for malaria-related hospitalizations, $176,391,466 in total hospital costs, and
$555,435,849 in total charges. Mean charges increased significantly over the
study period. Males, Blacks, and patients aged 25-44years accounted for the
highest direct and indirect costs. Older age and having severe malaria was
associated with a longer length of stay. Older age, severe malaria, HIV
infection, and longer lengths of stay were associated with higher charges and
costs.
CONCLUSIONS: Malaria resulted in substantial direct and indirect costs in the US.
Primary and secondary prevention measures should be prioritized among high-risk
groups to reduce the economic burden.

BACKGROUND: Emerging resistance to anti-malarial drugs has led malaria
researchers to investigate what covariates (parasite and host factors) are
associated with resistance. In this regard, investigation of how covariates
impact malaria parasites clearance is often performed using a two-stage approach 
in which the WWARN Parasite Clearance Estimator or PCE is used to estimate
parasite clearance rates and then the estimated parasite clearance is regressed
on the covariates. However, the recently developed Bayesian Clearance Estimator
instead leads to more accurate results for hierarchial regression modelling which
motivated the authors to implement the method as an R package, called "bhrcr".
METHODS: Given malaria parasite clearance profiles of a set of patients, the
"bhrcr" package performs Bayesian hierarchical regression to estimate malaria
parasite clearance rates along with the effect of covariates on them in the
presence of "lag" and "tail" phases. In particular, the model performs a linear
regression of the log clearance rates on covariates to estimate the effects
within a Bayesian hierarchical framework. All posterior inferences are obtained
by a "Markov Chain Monte Carlo" based sampling scheme which forms the core of the
package.
RESULTS: The "bhrcr" package can be utilized to study malaria parasite clearance 
data, and specifically, how covariates affect parasite clearance rates. In
addition to estimating the clearance rates and the impact of covariates on them, 
the "bhrcr" package provides tools to calculate the WWARN PCE estimates of the
parasite clearance rates as well. The fitted Bayesian model to the clearance
profile of each individual, as well as the WWARN PCE estimates, can also be
plotted by this package.
CONCLUSIONS: This paper explains the Bayesian Clearance Estimator for malaria
researchers including describing the freely available software, thus making these
methods accessible and practical for modelling covariates' effects on parasite
clearance rates.

BACKGROUND: In acute falciparum malaria, asexual parasite reduction ratio two
days post-treatment initiation (PRRD2) ≥ 10 000 per cycle has been used as a
measure of the rapid clearance of parasitaemia and efficacy of artemisinin
derivatives. However, there is little evaluation of alternative measures; for
example, parasite reduction ratio one day after treatment initiation (PRRD1) and 
its relationship with parasite clearance time (PCT) or PRRD2. This study
evaluated the use of PRRD1 as a measure of responsiveness to antimalarial drugs.
METHODS: In acutely malarious children treated with artesunate-amodiaquine (AA), 
artemether-lumefantrine (AL) or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHP), the
relationships between PRRD1 or PRRD2 and PCT, and between PRRD1 and PRRD2 were
evaluated using linear regression. Agreement between estimates of PCT using PRRD1
and PRRD2 linear regression equations was evaluated using the Bland-Altman
analysis. Predictors of PRRD1 > 5000 per half cycle and PRRD2 ≥ 10 000 per cycle 
were evaluated using stepwise multiple logistic regression models. Using the
linear regression equation of the relationship between PRRD1 and PCT previously
generated in half of the DHP-treated children during the early study phase, PCT
estimates were compared in a prospective blinded manner with PCTs determined by
microscopy during the later study phase in the remaining half.
RESULTS: In 919 malarious children, PRRD1 was significantly higher in DHP- and
AA-treated compared with AL-treated children (P <  0.0001). PRRD1 or PRRD2 values
correlated significantly negatively with PCT values (P <  0.0001 for each) and
significantly positively with each other (P <  0.0001). PCT estimates from linear
regression equations for PRRD1 and PRRD2 showed insignificant bias on the
Bland-Altman plot (P = 0.7) indicating the estimates can be used interchangeably.
At presentation, age > 15 months, parasitaemia > 10 000/μl and DHP treatment
independently predicted PRRD1 > 5000 per half cycle, while age > 30 months,
haematocrit ≥31%, body temperature > 37.4 °C, parasitaemia > 100 000/μl, PRRD1
value > 1000 and no gametocytaemia independently predicted PRRD2 ≥ 10 000 per
cycle. Using the linear regression equation generated during the early phase in
166 DHP-treated children, PCT estimates and PCTs determined by microscopy in the 
155 children in the later phase were similar in the same patients.
CONCLUSIONS: PRRD1 and estimates of PCT using PRRD1 linear regression equation of
PRRD1 and PCT can be used in therapeutic efficacy studies.

Bioassays and molecular diagnostics are routinely used for the monitoring of
malaria vector populations to support insecticide resistance management (IRM),
guiding operational decisions on which insecticides ought to be used for
effective vector control. Previously developed TaqMan assays were optimised to
distinguish the wild-type L1014 from the knockdown resistance (kdr) point
mutations 1014F and 1014S (triplex reaction), and the N1575 wild-type from the
point mutation 1575Y (duplex reaction). Subsequently, artificial pools of
Anopheles gambiae (An. gambiae) specimens with known genotypes of L1014F, L1014S,
and N1575Y were created, nucleic acids were extracted, and kdr mutations were
detected. These data were then used to define a linear regression model that
predicts the allelic frequency within a pool of mosquitoes as a function of the
measured ΔCt values (Ct mutant - Ct wild type probe). Polynomial regression
models showed r2 values of >0.99 (p < 0.05). The method was validated with
populations of variable allelic frequencies, and found to be precise
(1.66⁻2.99%), accurate (3.3⁻5.9%), and able to detect a single heterozygous
mosquito mixed with 9 wild type individuals in a pool of 10. Its pilot
application in field-caught samples showed minimal differences from individual
genotyping (0.36⁻4.0%). It allowed the first detection of the super-kdr mutation 
N1575Y in An. gambiae from Mali. Using pools instead of individuals allows for
more efficient resistance allele screening, facilitating IRM.

Malaria contributes substantially to the poor health situation in the northern
region of Ghana, especially in the Bole district. This paper is an outcome of a
study, which assessed the factors that influenced the vulnerability of farming
households to malaria, as well as the economic burden of the malaria prevalence
in the Bole District, Ghana. The multiple linear regression model was used to
analyze the determinants of household's vulnerability to malaria, and to examine 
the relationship between the non-parametric dependent variable and dichotomous
independent variables. The outcome of the study revealed an increase in malaria
cases during the rainy season. Total direct cost of malaria care, number of
people comprising the farming household, support for malaria prevention,
information on mosquito breeding and development, and absenteeism from farm
emerged as the main factors, which influenced the households' vulnerability to
malaria. Direct and indirect costs of malaria treatment have negatively affected 
the households' budget. In addition, malaria treatment cost represented a
substantial portion of poor farming household income. The direct cost was
estimated to GH₵ 4059, and the indirect cost was estimated to GH₵ 4654. It was
recommended to the government of Ghana to expand the National Malaria Control
Program to the household level and make National Health Insurance Scheme more
efficient.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: High salt intake has been linked to several diseases
including obesity and an increased risk of death; however, fecal salinity and the
ability of salt to alter the gut microbiota, which was recently identified as an 
instrumental factor for health and disease, remains poorly explored.
METHODS/SUBJECTS: We analyzed the fecal samples of 1326 human individuals for
salinity by refractometry, 572 for gut microbiota by culturomics, and 164 by 16S 
rRNA-targeted metagenomics. Geographical origin, age, gender, and obesity were
tested as predictors of fecal salinity and halophilic diversity. All halophilic
isolates were characterized by taxonogenomics and their genome sequenced.
RESULTS: Fecal salinity was associated with obesity independently of geographical
origin, gender, and age. The first 2 human-associated halophilic archaeal members
were isolated along with 64 distinct halophilic species, including 21 new species
and 41 known in the environment but not in humans. No halophiles grow in less
than 1.5% salinity. Above this threshold, the richness of the halophilic
microbiota was correlated with fecal salinity (r = 0.58, p < 0.0001). 16S
metagenomics linked high fecal salinity to decreased diversity (linear
regression, p < .035) and a depletion in anti-obesity Akkermansia muciniphila and
Bifidobacterium, specifically B. longum and B. adolescentis. Genomics analysis
suggested that halophilic microbes are not only transient passengers but may be
residents of the human gut.
CONCLUSIONS: High salt levels are associated with alteration of the gut microbial
ecosystem and halophilic microbiota, as discovered during this study. Further
studies should clarify if the gut microbiota alterations associated with high
salt levels and the human halophilic microbiota could be causally related to
human disease, such as obesity.

This study is concerned with identifying features of 4-aminoquinoline scaffolds
that can help pinpoint characteristics that enhance activity against
chloroquine-resistant parasites. Statistically valid predictive models are
reported for a series of 4-aminoquinoline analogues that are active against
chloroquine-sensitive (NF54) and chloroquine-resistant (K1) strains of Plasmodium
falciparum. Quantitative structure activity relationship techniques, based on
statistical and machine learning methods such as multiple linear regression and
partial least squares, were used with a novel pruning method for the selection of
descriptors to develop robust models for both strains. Inspection of the dominant
descriptors supports the hypothesis that chemical features that enable
accumulation in the food vacuole of the parasite are key determinants of activity
against both strains. The hydrophilic properties of the compounds were found to
be crucial in predicting activity against the chloroquine-sensitive NF54 parasite
strain, but not in the case of the chloroquine-resistant K1 strain, in line with 
previous studies. Additionally, the models suggest that 'softer' compounds tend
to have improved activity for both strains than do 'harder' ones. The internally 
and externally validated models reported here should also prove useful in the
future screening of potential antimalarial compounds for targeting
chloroquine-resistant strains. Graphical Abstract Predictive models reveal linear
relationships for activity of 4-aminoquinoline analogues active against
chloroquine-sensitive strains of Plasmodium falciparum.

BACKGROUND: Lumefantrine is a long-acting antimalarial drug with an elimination
half-life of over 3 days and protein binding of 99 percent. Correlation of
lumefantrine concentrations from capillary plasma via fingerprick (Cc) versus
venous plasma (Cv) remains to be defined.
METHODS: Venous and capillary plasma samples were collected simultaneously from
children, pregnant women, and non-pregnant adults at 2, 24, 120hr post last dose 
of a standard 3-day artemether-lumefantrine regimen they received for
uncomplicated malaria. Some of the enrolled children and pregnant women were also
HIV-infected. Samples were analyzed via liquid chromatography tandem mass
spectrometry. Linear regression analysis was performed using the program Stata®
SE12.1.
RESULTS: In children, the linear regression equations for Cc vs Cv at 2, 24, and 
120hr (day 7) post dose are [Cc] = 1.05*[Cv]+95.0 (n = 142, R2 = 0.977), [Cc] =
0.995*[Cv]+56.7 (n = 147, R2 = 0.990) and [Cc] = 0.958*[Cv]+18.6 (n = 139, R2 =
0.994), respectively. For pregnant women, the equations are [Cc] = 1.04*[Cv]+68.1
(n = 43, R2 = 0.990), [Cc] = 0.997*[Cv]+37.3 (n = 43, R2 = 0.993) and [Cc] =
0.941*[Cv]+11.1 (n = 41, R2 = 0.941), respectively. For non-pregnant adults, the 
equations are [Cc] = 1.05*[Cv]-117 (n = 32, R2 = 0.958), [Cc] = 0.962*[Cv]+9.21
(n = 32, R2 = 0.964) and [Cc] = 1.04*[Cv]-40.1 (n = 32, R2 = 0.988),
respectively. In summary, a linear relationship with a slope of ~1 was found for 
capillary and venous lumefantrine levels in children, pregnant women and
non-pregnant adults at 2hr, 24hr and 120hr post last dose, representing
absorption, distribution, and elimination phases.
CONCLUSIONS: Capillary and venous plasma concentration of lumefantrine can be
used interchangeably at 1:1 ratio. Capillary sampling method via finger prick is 
a suitable alternative for sample collection in clinical studies.

Although effective in controlling malaria, indoor residual spraying results in
elevated exposure to insecticides such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT)
and pyrethroids. These chemicals cross the placenta, but no studies have examined
their associations with birth outcomes in populations residing in indoor residual
spraying areas. We investigated this question in the Venda Health Examination of 
Mothers, Babies and Their Environment (VHEMBE), a birth cohort study of 751 South
African children born between 2012 and 2013. We measured maternal peripartum
serum DDT and urine pyrethroid metabolite concentrations and collected data on
birth weight, length, head circumference, and duration of gestation. We analyzed 
the data using marginal structural models with inverse-probability-of-treatment
weights, generalized propensity scores, and standard conditional linear
regression. Using all 3 analytical methods, p,p'-DDT, o,p'-DDT, and to a lesser
extent p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene were related to elevated birth
weight, birth length, and head circumference among girls. Changes in gestational 
duration did not mediate this relationship, suggesting that these exposures
accelerate fetal growth, which is consistent with the known estrogenic properties
of o,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDT. No associations with pyrethroid metabolites were found.
Results suggest that prenatal exposure to DDT is related to elevated birth size. 
Further studies are needed to elucidate the implications of these findings.

OBJECTIVES: The recommended microscopy method by WHO to quantify malaria
parasitaemia yields inaccurate results when individual leucocyte (WBC) counts
deviate from 8000 leucocytes/μl. A method avoiding WBC count assumptions is the
Lambaréné method (LAMBA). Thus, this study compared validity and reliability of
the LAMBA and the WHO method.
METHODS: Three methods for counting parasitaemia were applied in parallel in a
blinded assessment: the LAMBA, the WHO method using a standard factor of
8000 leucocytes/μl ['simple WHO method' (sWHO)] and the WHO method using measured
WBC counts ['accurate WHO method' (aWHO)]. Validity was assessed by comparing
LAMBA and sWHO to the gold standard measurement of aWHO. Reliability was
ascertained by computation of intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs).
RESULTS: 787 malaria-positive thick smears were analysed. Parasitaemia as
determined by LAMBA and sWHO increasingly deviated from aWHO the more patients'
WBCs diverged from 8000/μl. Equations of linear regression models assessing
method deviation in percent from gold standard as function of WBC count were
y = -0.00608x (95% CI -0.00693 to -0.00524) + 47.8 for LAMBA and y = -0.0125x
(95% CI -0.01253 to -0.01247) + 100.1 for sWHO. Comparison of regression slopes
showed that the deviation was twice as high for sWHO as for LAMBA (P < 0.001).
ICCs were excellent (>90%) for both methods.
CONCLUSIONS: The LAMBA has higher validity than the sWHO and may therefore be
preferable in resource-limited settings without access to routine WBC-evaluation.

BACKGROUND: Maternal stress during pregnancy is associated with birth outcomes,
including birthweight. Exposure to natural disasters during pregnancy provides a 
model to study these relationships. However, few studies assess both stress and
diet, which might have interactive effects. Furthermore, most are conducted in
high-income countries. Patterns might differ in low- and middle-income countries 
(LMICs).
AIM: To study relationships between stress and diet during pregnancy, and infant 
birthweight, following a natural disaster in a lower-middle income country.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In 2015, the island nation of Vanuatu suffered a Category 5
cyclone. Three months later, the authors assessed hardship due to the cyclone,
distress, and dietary diversity among 900 women, including 187 pregnant women. Of
these, 70 had birth records available. Multivariate linear regression was used to
analyse relationships between cyclone exposure and infant birthweight among this 
sub-sample.
RESULTS: Neither hardship nor dietary diversity predicted birthweight. Distress
was a robust predictor, explaining 8.5% of variance (p = 0.012). There were no
interactive relationships between distress and other exposure variables.
CONCLUSIONS: Maternal distress following a natural disaster has important
implications for maternal and child health. In LMICs, low birthweight remains a
pressing public health concern. Distress during pregnancy might represent one
underlying risk factor.

BACKGROUND: The hypotheses put forward to explain the malaria transmission cycle 
in extra-Amazonian Brazil, an area of very low malaria incidence, are based on
either a zoonotic scenario involving simian malaria, or a scenario in which
asymptomatic carriers play an important role.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence of asymptomatic infection by detecting
Plasmodium spp. DNA and its role in residual malaria transmission in a
non-Amazonian region of Brazil.
METHODS: Upon the report of the first malaria case in 2010 in the Atlantic Forest
region of the state of Espírito Santo, inhabitants within a 2 km radius were
invited to participate in a follow-up study. After providing signed informed
consent forms, inhabitants filled out a questionnaire and gave blood samples for 
PCR, and thick and thin smears. Follow-up visits were performed every 3 months
over a 21 month period, when new samples were collected and information was
updated.
RESULTS: Ninety-two individuals were initially included for follow-up. At the
first collection, all of them were clearly asymptomatic. One individual was
positive for Plasmodium vivax, one for Plasmodium malariae and one for both P.
vivax and P. malariae, corresponding to a prevalence of 3.4% (2.3% for each
species). During follow-up, four new PCR-positive cases (two for each species)
were recorded, corresponding to an incidence of 2.5 infections per 100
person-years or 1.25 infections per 100 person-years for each species. A
mathematical transmission model was applied, using a low frequency of human
carriers and the vector density in the region, and calculated based on previous
studies in the same locality whose results were subjected to a linear regression.
This analysis suggests that the transmission chain is unlikely to be based solely
on human carriers, regardless of whether they are symptomatic or not.
CONCLUSION: The low incidence of cases and the low frequency of asymptomatic
malaria carriers investigated make it unlikely that the transmission chain in the
region is based solely on human hosts, as cases are isolated one from another by 
hundreds of kilometers and frequently by long periods of time, reinforcing
instead the hypothesis of zoonotic transmission.

Background: The relationship between malaria infection and nutritional status is 
complex. Previous studies suggest malaria may increase the incidence and severity
of malnutrition, while malnutrition may increase the risk of malaria infection.
Here, we report bidirectional associations between malaria and nutritional status
among children with uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition (SAM).
Methods: This study is a secondary analysis of a randomized, controlled trial for
the treatment of uncomplicated SAM in Niger. Children aged 6-59 months were
enrolled and followed for 12 weeks. Malaria infection was assessed using an
histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2) rapid diagnostic test at admission and at any
follow-up visit with fever. We assessed the association of nutritional status at 
admission on malaria incidence using Cox proportional hazards regression and
malaria infection at admission on nutritional recovery and weight and height gain
using linear regression.
Results: Of 2399 children included in the analysis, 1327 (55.3%) were infected
with malaria at admission. Malaria incidence was 12.1 cases/100 person-months
among those without malaria infection at admission. Nutritional status at
admission was not associated with malaria incidence. Children with malaria
infection at admission and subsequently treated with an artemisinin-based
combination therapy had increased weight gain (0.38 g/kg/day; 95% confidence
interval [CI], 0.07 to 0.69) and reduced height gain (-0.002 mm/day; 95% CI,
-0.004 to -0.0008).
Conclusions: Malaria infection was common among children treated for
uncomplicated SAM. Malaria infection may impair height gain. Proper medical and
nutritional management should be ensured to prevent adverse effects of malaria
infection.

BACKGROUND: Inappropriate use of antibiotics is a global public health challenge 
and has been associated with antibiotic resistance. WHO reports show that efforts
to promote rational antibiotic use in developing countries are poor. With the
growing number of infections with antibiotic resistant bacteria, rational drug
use becomes imperative and studies that promote rational drug use are highly
necessary. Considering this, we investigated prescribing patterns and predictors 
of antibiotic prescription in primary health care facilities in Kumbo East (KE)
and Kumbo West (KW) health districts in North West Cameroon, to contribute data
which could influence policy on antibiotic use.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: A cross sectional retrospective study was conducted from
April 2014 to April 2015 in 26 randomly selected primary care facilities.
Questionnaires were administered to 59 antibiotic prescribers to determine
factors that predict antibiotic prescribing. Data on antibiotic prescription were
collected by review of consultation registers. Prescription rates and
demographics, prescriber and institution factors were analyzed using ANOVA. The
best predictor of prescription was determined using multiple linear regression
analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 30,096 prescriptions were reviewed. Overall antibiotic
prescription rate was 36.71%, with a mean of 1.14 antibiotics prescribed per
patient. Amoxicillin was the most prescribed (29.9%). The most prevalent
indications for prescribing were respiratory tract infections (21.27%). All
antibiotics prescribed were broad-spectrum. Antibiotics were prescribed for
patients with malaria and also in situations where diagnosis was uncertain.
Prescribing by generic name was 98.36% while 99.87% was from Essential Drug List.
Use of laboratory results, patient turnout and Performance Based Financing (PBF) 
were significantly associated with antibiotic prescribing rates (p < 0.05). PBF
moderated prescribing.
CONCLUSION: There was misuse of antibiotics in primary care facilities in study
area. We recommend all primary care health facilities in study area to be
included in the PBF scheme and that prescribing should only be done by physicians
as the have adequate training.

BACKGROUND: Undernutrition among children under 5 years of age continues to be a 
public health challenge in many low- and middle-income countries and can lead to 
growth stunting. Infectious diseases may also affect child growth, however their 
actual impact on the latter can be difficult to quantify. In this paper, we
analyse data from 20 Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) conducted in 13 African
countries to investigate the relationship between malaria and stunting. Our
objective is to make inference on the association between malaria incidence
during the first year of life and height-for-age Z-scores (HAZs).
METHODS: We develop a geostatistical model for HAZs as a function of both
measured and unmeasured child-specific and spatial risk factors. We visualize
stunting risk in each of the 20 analysed surveys by mapping the predictive
probability that HAZ is below - 2. Finally, we carry out a meta-analysis by
modelling the estimated effects of malaria incidence on HAZ from each DHS as a
linear regression on national development indicators from the World Bank.
RESULTS: A non-spatial univariate linear regression of HAZ on malaria incidence
showed a negative association in 18 out of 20 surveys. However, after adjusting
for spatial risk factors and controlling for confounding effects, we found a
weaker association between HAZ and malaria, with a mix of positive and negative
estimates, of which 3 out of 20 are significantly different from zero at the
conventional 5% level. The meta-analysis showed that this variation in the
estimated effect of malaria incidence on HAZ is significantly associated with the
amount of arable land.
CONCLUSION: Confounding effects on the association between malaria and stunting
vary both by country and over time. Geostatistical analysis provides a useful
framework that allows to account for unmeasured spatial confounders. Establishing
whether the association between malaria and stunting is causal would require
longitudinal follow-up data on individual children.

Although RTS,S remains the most advanced malaria vaccine, the factors influencing
differences in vaccine immunogenicity or efficacy between individuals or
populations are still poorly characterised. The analyses of genetic determinants 
of immunogenicity have previously been restricted by relatively small sample
sizes from individual trials. Here we combine data from six Phase II RTS,S trials
and evaluate the relationship between HLA allele groups and RTS,S-mediated
protection in controlled human malaria infections (CHMI), using multivariate
logistic or linear regression. We observed significant associations between three
allele groups (HLA-A∗01, HLA-B∗08, and HLA-DRB1∗15/∗16) and protection, while
another three allele groups (HLA-A∗03, HLA-B∗53, and HLA-DRB1∗07) were
significantly associated with lack of protection. It is noteworthy that these
'protective' allele groups are thought to be at a lower prevalence in sub-Saharan
African populations than in the UK or USA where these Phase II trials occurred.
Taken together, the analyses presented here give an indication that HLA genotype 
may influence RTS,S-mediated protective efficacy against malaria infection.

BACKGROUND: Severe malaria is a leading cause of acquired neurodisability in
Africa and is associated with reduced nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability. A
neuroprotective role for inhaled NO has been reported in animal studies, and
administration of inhaled NO in preterm neonates with respiratory distress
syndrome is associated with a 47% reduced risk of cognitive impairment at two
years of age.
METHODS: A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of inhaled NO versus 
placebo as an adjunctive therapy for severe malaria was conducted in Uganda
between 2011 and 2013. Children received study gas for a maximum 72 hours
(inhaled NO, 80 parts per million; room air placebo). Neurocognitive testing was 
performed on children<5 years at 6 month follow-up. The neurocognitive outcomes
assessed were overall cognition (a composite of fine motor, visual reception,
receptive language, and expressive language), attention, associative memory, and 
the global executive composite. Main outcomes were attention, associative memory,
and overall cognitive ability.
RESULTS: Sixty-one children receiving iNO and 59 children receiving placebo were 
evaluated. Forty-two children (35.0%) were impaired in at least one
neurocognitive domain. By intention-to-treat analysis, there were no differences 
in unadjusted or unadjusted age-adjusted z-scores for overall cognition (β (95%
CI): 0.26 (-0.19, 0.72), p = 0.260), attention (0.18 (-0.14, 0.51), p = 0.267),
or memory (0.14 (-0.02, 0.30), p = 0.094) between groups by linear regression.
Children receiving inhaled NO had a 64% reduced relative risk of fine motor
impairment than children receiving placebo (relative risk, 95% CI: 0.36,
0.14-0.96) by log binomial regression following adjustment for anticonvulsant
use.
CONCLUSIONS: Severe malaria is associated with high rates of neurocognitive
impairment. Treatment with inhaled NO was associated with reduced risk of fine
motor impairment. These results need to be prospectively validated in a larger
study powered to assess cognitive outcomes in order to evaluate whether
strategies to increase bioavailable NO are neuroprotective in children with
severe malaria.

Inflammation-induced hyporetinolemia (IIH), a reduction in serum retinol (SR)
during inflammation, may bias population estimates of vitamin A deficiency (VAD).
The optimal adjustment for IIH depends on the type and extent of inflammation. In
rural Zambian children (4-8 years, N = 886), we compared three models for
defining inflammation: α-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) only (inflammation present if 
> 1 g/L or normal if otherwise), C-reactive protein (CRP) only (moderate
inflammation, 5-15 mg/L; high inflammation, > 15 mg/L; or normal if otherwise)
and a combined model using both AGP and CRP to delineate stages of infectious
episode. Models were compared with respect to 1) the variance in SR explained and
2) comparability of inflammation-adjusted VAD estimated in low and high malaria
seasons. Linear regression was used to estimate the variance in SR explained by
each model and in estimating the adjustment factors used in generating adjusted
VAD (retinol < 0.7 μmol/L). The variance in SR explained were 2% (AGP-only), 11% 
(CRP-only), and 11% (AGP-CRP) in the low malaria season; and 2% (AGP-only), 15%
(CRP-only), and 12% (AGP-CRP) in the high malaria season. Adjusted VAD estimates 
in the low and high malaria seasons differed significantly for the AGP (8.2
versus 13.1%) and combined (5.5 versus 9.1%) models but not the CRP-only model
(6.1 versus 6.3%). In the multivariate regression, a decline in SR was observed
with rising CRP (but not AGP), in both malaria seasons (slope = -0.06; P <
0.001). In this malaria endemic setting, CRP alone, as opposed to CRP and AGP,
emerged as the most appropriate model for quantifying IIH.

Despite good progress towards elimination, malaria continues to contribute
substantially to the sub-Saharan African disease burden. Sustaining previous
gains requires continued readiness to deliver malaria services in response to
actual disease burden, which in turn contributes to health systems strengthening.
This study investigates a health system innovation. We examined whether malaria
prevalence, or endemicity, is a driver of health facility readiness to deliver
malaria services. To estimate this association, we geo-linked cross-sectional
facility survey data to endemicity data for Kenya, Namibia and Senegal. We tested
the validity and reliability of the primary study outcome, the malaria service
readiness index and mapped service readiness components in a geographic
information system. We conducted a weighted multivariable linear regression
analysis of the relationship between endemicity and malaria service readiness,
stratified for urban or rural facility location. As endemicity increased in rural
areas, there was a concurrent, modest increase in service readiness at the
facility level [β: 0.028; (95% CI 0.008, 0.047)], whereas no relationship existed
in urban settings. Private-for-profit facilities were generally less prepared
than public [β: -0.102; (95% CI - 0.154, -0.050)]. Most facilities had the
necessary supplies to diagnose malaria, yet availability of malaria guidelines
and adequately trained staff as well as medicines and commodities varied.
Findings require cautious interpretation outside the study sample, which was a
more limited subset of the original surveys' sampling schemes. Our approach and
findings may be used by national malaria programs to identify low performing
facilities in malarious areas for targeted service delivery interventions. This
study demonstrates use of existing data sources to evaluate health system
performance and to identify within- and cross-country variations for targeted
interventions.

INTRODUCTION: During pregnancy, immunoglobulin G (IgG) is transferred from the
mother to the fetus, providing protection from disease in early infancy.
Plasmodium falciparum infections may reduce maternofetal antibody transfer
efficiency, but mechanisms remain unclear.
METHODS: Mother-cord paired serum samples collected at delivery from Papua New
Guinea (PNG) and the Thailand-Myanmar Border Area (TMBA) were tested for IgG1 and
IgG3 to four P. falciparum antigens and measles antigen, as well as total serum
IgG. Multivariable linear regression was conducted to assess the association of
peripheral P. falciparum infection during pregnancy or placental P. falciparum
infection assessed at delivery with maternofetal antibody transfer efficiency.
Path analysis assessed the extent to which associations between P. falciparum
infection and antibody transfer were mediated by gestational age at delivery or
levels of maternal total serum IgG.
RESULTS: Maternofetal antibody transfer efficiency of IgG1 and IgG3 was lower in 
PNG compared to TMBA (mean difference in cord antibody levels (controlling for
maternal antibody levels) ranged from -0.88 to 0.09, median of -0.20 log2 units).
Placental P. falciparum infections were associated with substantially lower
maternofetal antibody transfer efficiency in PNG primigravid women (mean
difference in cord antibody levels (controlling for maternal antibody levels)
ranged from -0.62 to -0.10, median of -0.36 log2 units), but not multigravid
women. The lower antibody transfer efficiency amongst primigravid women with
placental infection was only partially mediated by gestational age at delivery
(proportion indirect effect ranged from 0% to 18%), whereas no mediation effects 
of maternal total serum IgG were observed.
DISCUSSION: Primigravid women may be at risk of impaired maternofetal antibody
transport with placental P. falciparum infection. Direct effects of P. falciparum
on the placenta, rather than earlier gestational age and elevated serum IgG, are 
likely responsible for the majority of the reduction in maternofetal antibody
transfer efficiency with placental infection.

BACKGROUND: Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is an inherited
disorder common in Sardinia. In this study, the frequency variation of
G6PD-deficiency across age groups and birth cohorts was investigated using
Age-Period-Cohort analysis.
METHODS: Data were collected from the clinical records of 11,252 patients (6975
women, age range 17-94 years) who underwent endoscopy between 2000 and 2016 at a 
teaching hospital (University of Sassari), Italy. G6PD status was assessed by
enzymatic assay based on G6PD/6GPD ratio. A Poisson log-linear regression model
was used to identify age and time trend in G6PD deficiency.
RESULTS: Enzyme deficiency was detected in 11.4% of the entire cohort (men: 7.9%;
women: 13.6%). Age-Period-Cohort analysis showed no inflection points across age 
groups, especially after age 80. The effects of time period and birth cohorts on 
G6PD deficiency were negligible (frequencies before and after 1950 were 11.0% and
11.8%, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the frequency of G6PD deficiency does
not vary significantly in oldest subjects. The lack of evidence for selection
across the malaria eradication time may be explained by other factors, including 
somatic cell selection or misclassification of heterozygotes women as G6PD normal
in the older birth cohorts. Additional molecular studies may help clarify these
issues. Key message The frequency of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency
is stable across age groups and does not vary in generations born before or after
malaria eradication.

Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention (SMC) is recommended for children under 5 in the
Sahel and sub-Sahel. The burden in older children may justify extending the age
range, as has been done effectively in Senegal. We examine costs of door-to-door 
SMC delivery to children up to 10 years by community health workers (CHWs). We
analysed incremental financial and economic costs at district level and below
from a health service perspective. We examined project accounts and prospectively
collected data from 405 CHWs, 46 health posts, and 4 district headquarters by
introducing questionnaires in advance and completing them after each monthly
implementation round. Affordability was explored by comparing financial costs of 
SMC to relevant existing health expenditure levels. Costs were disaggregated by
administration month and by health service level. We used linear regression
models to identify factors associated with cost variation between health posts.
The financial cost to administer SMC to 180 000 children over one malaria season,
reaching ∼93% of children with all three intended courses of SMC was $234 549
(constant 2010 USD) or $0.50 per monthly course administered. Excluding
research-participation incentives, the financial cost was $0.32 per resident (all
ages) in the catchment area, which is 1.2% of Senegal's general government
expenditure on health per capita. Economic costs were 18.7% higher than financial
costs at $278 922 or $0.59 per course administered and varied widely between
health posts, from $0.38 to $2.74 per course administered. Substantial economies 
of scale across health posts were found, with the smallest health posts incurring
highest average costs per monthly course administered. SMC for children up to 10 
is likely to be affordable, particularly where it averts substantial curative
care costs. Estimates of likely costs and cost-effectiveness of SMC in other
contexts must account for variation in average costs across delivery months and
health posts.

The main malaria vectors in sub-Saharan Africa, the Anopheles gambiae (Giles;
Diptera: Culicidae), normally breed in clean water sources. However, evidence
suggests an on-going adaptation of Anopheline species to polluted breeding
habitats in urban settings. This study aimed at understanding the adaptation to
breeding in water bodies with different qualities, in five selected mosquito
breeding sites in urban Accra, Ghana. The study sites were also evaluated for the
WHO water-quality parameters as a measure of pollution, and insecticide residues.
Field mosquitoes were evaluated for five genes; CYP6P3, CYP4H19, CYP4H24,
GSTD1-4, and ABCC11-associated with insecticide detoxification-using quantitative
RT-PCR, as well as Mono-oxygenase, Alpha Esterase, Glutathione S-transferase, and
insensitive acetylcholinesterase (AChE) using biochemical enzyme assays. The
lab-reared, insecticide susceptible An. gambiae Kisumu strain was bred in the
most polluted water source for 10 generations and evaluated for the same genes
and enzymes. The results revealed that the fold expression of the genes was
higher in the larvae compared with the adults. The results also suggest that
detoxification enzymes could be involved in the adaptation of An. gambiae to
polluted breeding sites. Correlation analysis revealed a highly positive
significant correlation between calcium levels and all five genes (P < 0.05).
Stepwise linear regression to understand which of the variables predicted the
expression of the genes revealed that sulphate was responsible for ABCC11 and
CYP4H24, alkalinity for GSTD1-4, and calcium for CYP4H19 and CYP6P3. The detailed
genetic basis of this adaptation need to be further investigated. A further
understanding of this adaptation may provide outlooks for controlling malaria and
other disease vectors adapted to polluted breeding water sources.

OBJECTIVES: Malaria in pregnancy (MiP) contributes to fetal undernutrition and
adverse birth outcomes, and may constitute a developmental origin of metabolic
diseases in the offspring. In a Ghanaian birth cohort, we examined the
relationships between MiP-exposure and metabolic traits in adolescence.
METHODS: MiP at delivery was assessed in 155 mother-child pairs. Among the now
teenaged children (mean age, 14.8 years; 53% male), we measured fasting plasma
glucose (FPG), body mass index (BMI), and systolic and diastolic blood pressure
(BP). Associations of MiP with the adolescents' FPG, BMI, and BP were examined by
linear regression.
RESULTS: At delivery, 45% were MiP-exposed, which increased FPG in adolescence,
adjusted for mother's age at delivery, parity and familial socio-economic status 
(infected vs. uninfected: mean ΔFPG = 0.20 mmol/L; 95% confidence interval (CI): 
0.01, 0.39; p = 0.049). As a trend,this was discernible for BP, particularly for 
microscopic infections (mean Δsystolic BP = 5.43 mmHg; 95% CI: 0.00, 10.88;
p = 0.050; mean Δdiastolic BP = 3.67 mmHg; 95% CI: -0.81, 8.14; p = 0.107). These
associations were largely independent of birth weight, gestational age and
teenage BMI. Adolescent BMI was not related to MiP.
CONCLUSIONS: In rural Ghana, exposure to malaria during fetal development
contributes to metabolic conditions in young adulthood.

BACKGROUND: The efficacy of vaccines aimed at inhibiting the growth of malaria
parasites in the blood can be assessed by comparing the growth rate of
parasitaemia in the blood of subjects treated with a test vaccine compared to
controls. In studies using induced blood stage malaria (IBSM), a type of
controlled human malaria infection, parasite growth rate has been measured using 
models with the intercept on the y-axis fixed to the inoculum size. A set of
statistical models was evaluated to determine an optimal methodology to estimate 
parasite growth rate in IBSM studies.
METHODS: Parasite growth rates were estimated using data from 40 subjects
published in three IBSM studies. Data was fitted using 12 statistical models:
log-linear, sine-wave with the period either fixed to 48 h or not fixed; these
models were fitted with the intercept either fixed to the inoculum size or not
fixed. All models were fitted by individual, and overall by study using a mixed
effects model with a random effect for the individual.
RESULTS: Log-linear models and sine-wave models, with the period fixed or not
fixed, resulted in similar parasite growth rate estimates (within 0.05 log10
parasites per mL/day). Average parasite growth rate estimates for models fitted
by individual with the intercept fixed to the inoculum size were substantially
lower by an average of 0.17 log10 parasites per mL/day (range 0.06-0.24) compared
with non-fixed intercept models. Variability of parasite growth rate estimates
across the three studies analysed was substantially higher (3.5 times) for
fixed-intercept models compared with non-fixed intercept models. The same
tendency was observed in models fitted overall by study. Modelling data by
individual or overall by study had minimal effect on parasite growth estimates.
CONCLUSIONS: The analyses presented in this report confirm that fixing the
intercept to the inoculum size influences parasite growth estimates. The most
appropriate statistical model to estimate the growth rate of blood-stage
parasites in IBSM studies appears to be a log-linear model fitted by individual
and with the intercept estimated in the log-linear regression. Future studies
should use this model to estimate parasite growth rates.

BACKGROUND: Chloroquine (CQ) is the main anti-schizontocidal drug used in the
treatment of uncomplicated malaria caused by Plasmodium vivax. Chloroquine
resistant P. vivax (PvCR) malaria in the Western Pacific region, Asia and in the 
Americas indicates a need for biomarkers of resistance to improve therapy and
enhance understanding of the mechanisms associated with PvCR. In this study, we
compared plasma metabolic profiles of P. vivax malaria patients with PvCR and
chloroquine sensitive parasites before treatment to identify potential molecular 
markers of chloroquine resistance.
METHODS: An untargeted high-resolution metabolomics analysis was performed on
plasma samples collected in a malaria clinic in Manaus, Brazil. Male and female
patients with Plasmodium vivax were included (n = 46); samples were collected
before CQ treatment and followed for 28 days to determine PvCR, defined as the
recurrence of parasitemia with detectable plasma concentrations of CQ ≥100 ng/dL.
Differentially expressed metabolic features between CQ-Resistant (CQ-R) and
CQ-Sensitive (CQ-S) patients were identified using partial least squares
discriminant analysis and linear regression after adjusting for covariates and
multiple testing correction. Pathway enrichment analysis was performed using
Mummichog.
RESULTS: Linear regression and PLS-DA methods yielded 69 discriminatory features 
between CQ-R and CQ-S groups, with 10-fold cross-validation classification
accuracy of 89.6% using a SVM classifier. Pathway enrichment analysis showed
significant enrichment (p<0.05) of glycerophospholipid metabolism,
glycosphingolipid metabolism, aspartate and asparagine metabolism, purine and
pyrimidine metabolism, and xenobiotics metabolism. Glycerophosphocholines levels 
were significantly lower in the CQ-R group as compared to CQ-S patients and also 
to independent control samples.
CONCLUSIONS: The results show differences in lipid, amino acids, and nucleotide
metabolism pathways in the plasma of CQ-R versus CQ-S patients prior to
antimalarial treatment. Metabolomics phenotyping of P. vivax samples from
patients with well-defined clinical CQ-resistance is promising for the
development of new tools to understand the biological process and to identify
potential biomarkers of PvCR.

A recent study of the RTS,S malaria vaccine, which is based on the
circumsporozoite protein (CSP), demonstrated an increase in efficacy from 50-60% 
to 80% when using a delayed fractional dose regimen, in which the standard 0-1-2 
month immunization schedule was modified to a 0-1-7 month schedule and the third 
immunization was delivered at 20% of the full dose. Given the role that
antibodies can play in RTS,S-induced protection, we sought to determine how the
modified regimen alters IgG subclasses and serum opsonophagocytic activity (OPA).
Previously, we showed that lower CSP-mediated OPA was associated with protection 
in an RTS,S study. Here we report that the delayed fractional dose regimen
resulted in decreased CSP-mediated OPA and an enhanced CSP-specific IgG4
response. Linear regression modeling predicted that CSP-specific IgG1 promote
OPA, and that CSP-specific IgG4 interferes with OPA, which we subsequently
confirmed by IgG subclass depletion. Although the role of IgG4 antibodies and OPA
in protection is still unclear, our findings, combined with previous results that
the delayed fractional dose increases CSP-specific antibody avidity and somatic
hypermutation frequency in CSP-specific B cells, demonstrate how changes in
vaccine regimen alone can significantly alter the quality of antibody responses
to improve vaccine efficacy.

BACKGROUND: Zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP) has been used to screen and manage iron
deficiency in individual children, but it has also been recommended to assess
population iron status. The diagnostic utility of ZPP used in combination with
haemoglobin concentration has not been evaluated in pre-school children. We aimed
to a) identify factors associated with ZPP in children aged 12-36 months; b)
assess the diagnostic performance and utility of ZPP, either alone or in
combination with haemoglobin, to detect iron deficiency.
METHODS: We used baseline data from 338 Kenyan children enrolled in a
community-based randomised trial. To identify factors related to ZZP measured in 
whole blood or erythrocytes, we used bivariate and multiple linear regression
analysis. To assess diagnostic performance, we excluded children with elevated
plasma concentrations of C-reactive protein or α1-acid glycoprotein, and with
Plasmodium infection, and we analysed receiver operating characteristics (ROC)
curves, with iron deficiency defined as plasma ferritin concentration < 12 μg/L. 
We also developed models to assess the diagnostic utility of ZPP and haemoglobin 
concentration when used to screen for iron deficiency.
RESULTS: Whole blood ZPP and erythrocyte ZPP were independently associated with
haemoglobin concentration, Plasmodium infection and plasma concentrations of
soluble transferrin receptor, ferritin, and C-reactive protein. In children
without inflammation or Plasmodium infection, the prevalence of true iron
deficiency was 32.1%, compared to prevalence of 97.5% and 95.1% when assessed by 
whole blood ZPP and erythrocyte ZPP with conventional cut-off points (70 μmol/mol
and 40 μmol/mol haem, respectively). Addition of whole blood ZPP or erythrocyte
ZPP to haemoglobin concentration increased the area-under-the-ROC-curve (84.0%,
p = 0.003, and 84.2%, p = 0.001, respectively, versus 62.7%). A diagnostic rule
(0.038689 [haemoglobin concentration, g/L] + 0.00694 [whole blood ZPP, μmol/mol
haem] >5.93120) correctly ruled out iron deficiency in 37.4%-53.7% of children
screened, depending on the true prevalence, with both specificity and negative
predictive value ≥90%.
CONCLUSIONS: In young children, whole blood ZPP and erythrocyte ZPP have added
diagnostic value in detecting iron deficiency compared to haemoglobin
concentration alone. A single diagnostic score based on haemoglobin concentration
and whole blood ZPP can rule out iron deficiency in a substantial proportion of
children screened.

Background: Anemia is common in Congolese children, and inherited blood disorders
may be a contributing cause. The presence of sickle cell variants, X-linked
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency and α-thalassemia, has been
previously reported. G6PD A- deficiency is characterized by the co-inheritance of
G6PD 376 and 202 variants and is common in sub-Saharan Africa.Objective: We aimed
to measure the associations between inherited blood disorders and hemoglobin,
ferritin, and soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) concentrations in Congolese
children.Methods: Venous blood was collected from 744 children aged 6-59 mo from 
2 provinces. We measured biomarkers of nutritional and inflammation status and
malaria. Pyrosequencing was used to detect sickle cell variants. Polymerase chain
reaction was used to detect G6PD variants and α-thalassemia deletions.Results:
Overall, 11% of children had a sickle cell variant, 19% of boys were G6PD A-
hemizygotes, 12% and 10% of girls were G6PD A- hetero- or homozygotes,
respectively, and 12% of children had α-thalassemia. Multivariable linear
regression models (adjusted for age, province, altitude, malaria, and biomarkers 
of nutritional and inflammation status) showed that G6PD A- hemizygous boys and
G6PD 376 homozygous girls had higher sTfR concentrations [geometric mean ratios
(95% CIs): 1.20 (1.03, 1.39) and 1.25 (1.02, 1.53), respectively] than children
with no G6PD variants. Hemoglobin and ferritin concentrations were not
independently associated with any of the inherited blood disorder
genotypes.Conclusions: We found that 2 G6PD variant genotypes were associated
with elevated sTfR concentrations, which limits the accuracy of sTfR as a
biomarker of iron status in this population.

Setting: The malaria-endemic country of Liberia, before, during and after the
2014 Ebola outbreak. Objective: To describe the consequences of the Ebola
outbreak on Liberia's National Malaria Programme and its post-Ebola recovery.
Design: A retrospective cross-sectional study using routine countrywide programme
data. Results: Malaria caseloads decreased by 47% during the Ebola outbreak and
by 11% after, compared to the pre-Ebola period. In those counties most affected
by Ebola, a caseload reduction of >20% was sustained for 12 consecutive months,
while this lasted for only 4 consecutive months in the counties least affected by
Ebola. Linear regression of monthly proportions of confirmed malaria cases-as a
proxy indicator of programme performance-over the pre- and post-Ebola periods
indicated that the malaria programme could require 26 months after the end of the
acute phase of the Ebola outbreak to recover to pre-Ebola levels. Conclusions:
The differential persistence of reduced caseloads in the least- and most-affected
counties, all of which experienced similar emergency measures, suggest that
factors other than Ebola-related security measures played a key role in the
programme's reduced performance. Clear guidance on when to abandon the emergency 
measures after an outbreak may be needed to ensure faster recovery of malaria
programme performance.

l'épidémie d'Ebola sur le programme national de lutte contre le paludisme et sa
récupération après Ebola.Schéma : Étude rétrospective transversale utilisant des 
données de routine du programme dans tout le pays.Résultats : Le nombre de cas de
paludisme déclarés a baissé de 47% pendant et de 11% après l'épidémie d'Ebola,
comparé à la période pré-Ebola. Dans les comtés les plus affectés par Ebola, une 
réduction de plus de 20% a été maintenue pendant plus de 12 mois consécutifs,
tandis que celle-ci n'a duré que pendant 4 mois consécutifs dans les comtés les
moins affectés par Ebola. Une régression linéaire des proportions mensuelles de
cas de paludisme confirmés—comme indicateur indirect de la performance du
programme—sur les périodes pré- et post-Ebola a montré que le programme paludisme
pourrait avoir besoin de 26 mois après la fin de la phase aiguë de l'épidémie
d'Ebola pour revenir aux niveaux d'avant Ebola.Conclusion: La persistance
différentielle de réduction des cas déclarés dans les comtés les moins et les
plus affectés, qui ont tous expérimenté des mesures d'urgence similaires, suggère
que des facteurs autres que les mesures de sécurité liées à Ebola ont joué des
rôles clés dans la réduction de la performance du programme. Des recommandations 
claires sur le moment auquel il faut abandonner les mesures d'urgence après une

notificación en las provincias menos afectadas y las más afectadas por la
epidemia, pese a que en todas las regiones se ejecutaron intervenciones de
emergencia equivalentes, indica que factores diferentes a las medidas de
seguridad desencadenadas por la epidemia influyeron de manera importante en la
disminución del desempeño del programa. Se precisan orientaciones claras con
respecto al momento más oportuno para interrumpir las intervenciones de
emergencia después de los brotes epidémicos, con el propósito de facilitar una
recuperación más rápida del funcionamiento del programa contra el paludismo.

BACKGROUND: In order to achieve the goal of malaria elimination, the Chinese
government launched the National Malaria Elimination Programme in 2010. However, 
as a result of increasing cross-border population movements, the risk of imported
malaria cases still exists at the border areas of China, resulting in a potential
threat of local transmission. The focus of this paper is to assess the Plasmodium
vivax incidences in Tengchong, Yunnan Province, at the border areas of China and 
Myanmar.
METHODS: Time series of P. vivax incidences in Tengchong from 2006 to 2010 are
collected from the web-based China Information System for Disease Control and
Prevention, which are further separated into time series of imported and local
cases. First, the seasonal and trend decomposition are performed on time series
of imported cases using Loess method. Then, the impact of climatic factors on the
local transmission of P. vivax is assessed using both linear regression models
(LRM) and generalized additive models (GAM). Specifically, the notion of
vectorial capacity (VCAP) is used to estimate the transmission potential of P.
vivax at different locations, which is calculated based on temperature and
rainfall collected from China Meteorological Administration.
RESULTS: Comparing with Ruili County, the seasonal pattern of imported cases in
Tengchong is different: Tengchong has only one peak, while Ruili has two peaks
during each year. This may be due to the different cross-border behaviors of
peoples in two locations. The vectorial capacity together with the imported cases
and the average humidity, can well explain the local incidences of P. vivax
through both LRM and GAM methods. Moreover, the maximum daily temperature is
verified to be more suitable to calculate VCAP than the minimal and average
temperature in Tengchong County.
CONCLUSION: To achieve malaria elimination in China, the assessment results in
this paper will provide further guidance in active surveillance and control of
malaria at the border areas of China and Myanmar.

Background: The first models of malaria transmission assumed a completely mixed
and homogeneous population of parasites. Recent models include spatial
heterogeneity and variably mixed populations. However, there are few empiric
estimates of parasite mixing with which to parametize such models. Methods: Here 
we genotype 276 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 5199 P. falciparum
isolates from two Kenyan sites (Kilifi county and Rachuonyo South district) and
one Gambian site (Kombo coastal districts) to determine the spatio-temporal
extent of parasite mixing, and use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and linear 
regression to examine the relationship between genetic relatedness and distance
in space and time for parasite pairs. Results: Using 107, 177 and 82 SNPs that
were successfully genotyped in 133, 1602, and 1034 parasite isolates from The
Gambia, Kilifi and Rachuonyo South district, respectively, we show that there are
no discrete geographically restricted parasite sub-populations, but instead we
see a diffuse spatio-temporal structure to parasite genotypes. Genetic
relatedness of sample pairs is predicted by relatedness in space and time.
Conclusions: Our findings suggest that targeted malaria control will benefit the 
surrounding community, but unfortunately also that emerging drug resistance will 
spread rapidly through the population.

BACKGROUND: Previous reviews have identified 44 risk factors for poor early child
development (ECD) in low- and middle-income countries. Further understanding of
their relative influence and pathways is needed to inform the design of
interventions targeting ECD.
METHODS: We conducted path analyses of factors associated with 18-month language 
and motor development in four prospective cohorts of children who participated in
trials conducted as part of the International Lipid-Based Nutrient Supplements
(iLiNS) Project in Ghana (n = 1,023), Malawi (n = 675 and 1,385), and Burkina
Faso (n = 1,122). In two cohorts, women were enrolled during pregnancy. In two
cohorts, infants were enrolled at 6 or 9 months. In multiple linear regression
and structural equation models (SEM), we examined 22 out of 44 factors identified
in previous reviews, plus 12 additional factors expected to be associated with
ECD.
RESULTS: Out of 42 indicators of the 34 factors examined, 6 were associated with 
18-month language and/or motor development in 3 or 4 cohorts: child linear and
ponderal growth, variety of play materials, activities with caregivers, dietary
diversity, and child hemoglobin/iron status. Factors that were not associated
with child development were indicators of maternal Hb/iron status, maternal
illness and inflammation during pregnancy, maternal perceived stress and
depression, exclusive breastfeeding during 6 months postpartum, and child
diarrhea, fever, malaria, and acute respiratory infections. Associations between 
socioeconomic status and language development were consistently mediated to a
greater extent by caregiving practices than by maternal or child biomedical
conditions, while this pattern for motor development was not consistent across
cohorts.
CONCLUSIONS: Key elements of interventions to ensure quality ECD are likely to be
promotion of caregiver activities with children, a variety of play materials, and
a diverse diet, and prevention of faltering in linear and ponderal growth and
improvement in child hemoglobin/iron status.

BACKGROUND: Since 2005, the Government of Ghana and its partners, in concerted
efforts to control malaria, scaled up the use of artemisinin-based combination
therapy (ACT) and insecticide-treated nets (ITNs). Beginning in 2011, a mass
campaign of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) was implemented, targeting all
the population. The impact of these interventions on malaria cases, admissions
and deaths was assessed using data from district hospitals.
METHODS: Records of malaria cases and deaths and availability of ACT in 88
hospitals, as well as at district level, ITN distribution, and indoor residual
spraying were reviewed. Annual proportion of the population potentially protected
by ITNs was estimated with the assumption that each LLIN covered 1.8 persons for 
3 years. Changes in trends of cases and deaths in 2015 were estimated by
segmented log-linear regression, comparing trends in post-scale-up (2011-2015)
with that of pre-scale-up (2005-2010) period. Trends of mortality in children
under 5 years old from population-based household surveys were also compared with
the trends observed in hospitals for the same time period.
RESULTS: Among all ages, the number of outpatient malaria cases (confirmed and
presumed) declined by 57% (95% confidence interval [CI], 47-66%) by first half of
2015 (during the post-scale-up) compared to the pre-scale-up (2005-2010) period. 
The number of microscopically confirmed cases decreased by 53% (28-69%) while
microscopic testing was stable. Test positivity rate (TPR) decreased by 41%
(19-57%). The change in malaria admissions was insignificant while malaria deaths
fell significantly by 65% (52-75%). In children under 5 years old, total malaria 
outpatient cases, admissions and deaths decreased by 50% (32-63%), 46% (19-75%)
and 70% (49-82%), respectively. The proportion of outpatient malaria cases,
admissions and deaths of all-cause conditions in both all ages and children under
five also fell significantly by >30%. Similar decreases in the main malaria
indicators were observed in the three epidemiological strata (coastal, forest,
savannah). All-cause admissions increased significantly in patients covered by
the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) compared to the non-insured. The
non-malaria cases and non-malaria deaths increased or remained unchanged during
the same period. All-cause mortality for children under 5 years old in household 
surveys, similar to those observed in the hospitals, declined by 43% between 2008
and 2014.
CONCLUSIONS: The data provide compelling evidence of impact following LLIN mass
campaigns targeting all ages since 2011, while maintaining other anti-malarial
interventions. Malaria cases and deaths decreased by over 50 and 65%,
respectively. The declines were stronger in children under five. Test positivity 
rate in all ages decreased by >40%. The decrease in malaria deaths was against a 
backdrop of increased admissions owing to free access to hospitalization through 
the NHIS. The study demonstrated that retrospective health facility-based data
minimize reporting biases to assess effect of interventions. Malaria control in
Ghana is dependent on sustained coverage of effective interventions and
strengthened surveillance is vital to monitor progress of these investments.

BACKGROUND: In individuals living in malaria-endemic regions, parasitaemia
thresholds for the onset of clinical symptoms vary with transmission intensity.
The mechanisms that mediate this relationship are however, unclear. Since
inflammatory responses to parasite infection contribute to the clinical
manifestation of malaria, this study investigated inflammatory cytokine responses
in children with malaria from areas of different transmission intensities
(ranging from low to high).
METHODS: Blood samples were obtained from children confirmed with malaria at
community hospitals in three areas with differing transmission intensities.
Cytokine levels were assessed using the Luminex®-based magnetic bead array
system, and levels were compared across sites using appropriate statistical
tests. The relative contributions of age, gender, parasitaemia and transmission
intensity on cytokine levels were investigated using multivariate regression
analysis.
RESULTS: Parasite density increased with increasing transmission intensity in
children presenting to hospital with symptomatic malaria, indicating that the
parasitaemia threshold for clinical malaria increases with increasing
transmission intensity. Furthermore, levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines,
including tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ),
interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-12, decreased with increasing
transmission intensity, and correlated significantly with parasitaemia levels in 
the low transmission area but not in high transmission areas. Similarly, levels
of anti-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-4, IL-7, IL-10 and IL-13, decreased 
with increasing transmission intensity, with IL-10 showing strong correlation
with parasitaemia levels in the low transmission area. Multiple linear regression
analyses revealed that transmission intensity was a stronger predictor of
cytokine levels than age, gender and parasitaemia.
CONCLUSION: Taken together, the data demonstrate a strong relationship between
the prevailing transmission intensity, parasitaemia levels and the magnitude of
inflammatory responses induced during clinical malaria.

Plasmodium vivax has been reported to cause severe malaria, and one of the main
resulting complications is anemia. Considering that P. vivax infects only young
erythrocytes, anemia has been associated with the destruction of infected and
non-infected erythrocytes. However, few studies have focused on understanding the
relationship between the pathogenesis of P. vivax malaria and human genetic
polymorphisms. Although ABO groups seem to influence the outcome of Plasmodium
falciparum malaria, the association between P. vivax and ABO blood groups has
been minimally investigated. Thus, we investigate the correlation between ABO
blood groups and anemia induced by P. vivax infection. Five single nucleotide
polymorphisms at the ABO gene were genotyped by PCR-RFLP and Real-Time PCR in P. 
vivax-infected subjects. The ABO blood types were associated with the
hematological data of the patients. Our main finding was that type O
infected-individuals showed lower levels of hemoglobin and hematocrit compared to
type A-infected individuals. The correlation between ABO blood groups and
hemoglobin levels remained significant when a multiple linear regression was
applied with the possible confounding effects of clinical-epidemiologic variables
taken into account. The finding that type O individuals have a higher frequency
of anemia is a first step to understand the mechanisms involved in malaria
anemia, which could be associated to increased destruction of type O
erythrocytes.

BACKGROUND: Indoor residual spraying (IRS) is known to reduce malaria
transmission. In northern Uganda, a high endemic area, IRS has been implemented
since 2006. Limited data however, exists on the effect of IRS on the malaria
burden. This study sought to assess the effect of IRS on malaria morbidity in the
high intensity area of northern Uganda. Retrospective routine data from ten
health facilities in three districts which had received at least five rounds of
IRS in northern Uganda was analysed. The primary outcome of interest was malaria 
morbidity, measured by the slide positivity rate (SPR). Descriptive statistics
were used to describe the malaria morbidity stratified by age and sex. The
average change in the malaria morbidity, measured by the SPR was assessed
according to time, measured as calendar months. A fixed-effects linear regression
model was used which included a polynomial function of time and controlled for
malaria seasonality and variations between districts/facilities.
RESULTS: The total out-patient department attendance in the ten health facilities
for the study period was 2,779,246, of which 736,034 (26.5%) malaria cases were
diagnosed with 374,826 (50.9%) cases of under 5 years and an overall SPR of
37.5%. The percentage point (p.p.) changes in SPR according to time measured as
calendar months following IRS, revealed a decreasing trend in malaria morbidity
in the first 3 months following each round of IRS. The highest percentage point
decrease in the SPR was observed in the second month following IRS (9.5 p.p., CI 
-17.85 to -1.16, p = 0.026), among patients above 5 years. The SPR decline
however waned by the fourth month following IRS, with an increase in the SPR of
8.4 p.p. at district level by the sixth month, p = 0.510.
CONCLUSION: The study results show that IRS was associated with a significant
reduction in malaria morbidity in northern Uganda in the first 3 months following
IRS. The malaria reduction however waned by the fourth month following IRS.

BACKGROUND: In 2010, the World Health Organization issued a guideline that calls 
for a shift from presumptive to test-based treatment. However, test-based
treatment is still unpopular in community pharmacies. This could be due to
unwillingness of customers to spend extra finance on rapid diagnostic test (RDT).
It could also result from lack of interest from community pharmacists since they 
may perceive no financial gain attached to this service. This study assessed the 
cost-benefit of test-based malaria treatment to community pharmacists.
METHODS: The study was a community pharmacy-based cross sectional survey.
Potential benefit of RDT was determined using customers' willingness-to-pay (WTP)
for service. Average WTP was estimated using contingent valuation. Binary
logistic regression was used to assess correlates of WTP acceptance while
multiple linear regression was used to model the relationship between the
independent variables and WTP amount. Cost associated with provision of RDT was
estimated from provider's perspective. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was
used to capture parameter uncertainty. Benefit-cost ratio (BCR) was calculated to
determine study objective.
RESULTS: A total of 135 out of 235 participants (57.4%) responded to the WTP
question. Of this subset, 111 participants (82.2%) preferred RDT before malaria
treatment. Average WTP [minimum-maximum] was US$1.23 [US$0.0-US$5.03]. Educated
participants had 1.8 times higher odds of WTP for RDT. Participants that
understood RDT as described in the questionnaire had 18.3 times higher odds of
WTP for RDT compared to participants that did not understand RDT as described in 
the questionnaire. Additionally, a unit increase in level of education (e.g. from
primary to secondary school) led to US$0.298 increase in WTP amount for RDT.
Also, a unit increase in malaria frequency (e.g. from 'never' to 'rarely') led to
US$0.293 decrease in WTP amount for RDT. Average cost [minimum-maximum] of RDT
test kit and pharmacist time spent in administering the test were US$0.15
[US$0.13-US$0.17] and US$0.41 [US$0.18-US$0.52], respectively. BCR of test-based 
malaria treatment was 6.7 (95% CI 6.4-7.0).
CONCLUSION: Test-based malaria treatment is cost-beneficial for pharmacy
practitioners. This finding could be used as an advocacy tool to increase
community pharmacists' interest and uptake of test-based malaria treatment.

BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Antimalarial drug resistance is a serious challenge to
malaria control worldwide. In vitro sensitivity assays provide an early
indication of emerging drug resistance. In vitro susceptibility of field and
culture adapted Plasmodium falciparum isolates to different antimalarials was
compared using two Methods: World Health Organization (WHO) micro-test (MARK III)
and histidine rich protein II (HRP II) based enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA).
METHODS: In total, 50 P. falciparum isolates were collected from five states,
viz. Chhattisgarh, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Tripura and Odisha of India during
December 2011-September 2014. The isolates were revived and evaluated for their
susceptibility to chloroquine (CQ), monodesethylamodiaquine (AQ), mefloquine
(MQ), quinine (QN) and artemisinin (ART) using the WHO micro-test (Mark III) and 
HRP II ELISA. The data were analyzed using non- linear regression analysis.
RESULTS: The geometric mean (GM) IC50 values of different antimalarials for WHO
Mark III assay were comparatively lower than HRP II ELISA assay. The GM IC50
value for CQ was 59.5 nM (95% confidence interval [CI]: 49.35-71.73 nM) and 78.34
nM (95% CI: 64.57-95.03 nM) for Mark III and HRP II ELISA, respectively.
Similarly, the values of GM IC50 for AQ, MQ, QN and ART by Mark III and HRP II
ELISA were 13.31, 7.07, 146.4, 0.43 nM and 22.02, 11.46, 258.7, 1.00 nM,
respectively. On analyzing statistically, the results of both assays were
comparable (R2 = 0.96, p < 0.001; mean log difference at IC50= 0.037).
INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: The HRP II ELISA assay showed a reliable sensitivity
in comparison to WHO Mark III micro-test complemented with distinguishing
features such as high specificity, ease of performance, and notable consistency.

Maternal plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) status and its association with
pregnancy outcomes in malaria holoendemic regions of sub-Saharan Africa is poorly
defined. We examined this association and any potential interaction with malaria 
and helminth infections in an ongoing pregnancy cohort study in Kenya. The
association of maternal plasma 25(OH)D status with pregnancy outcomes and infant 
anthropometric measurements at birth was determined in a subset of women (n =
63). Binomial and linear regression analyses were used to examine associations
between maternal plasma 25(OH)D and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Fifty-one percent
of the women had insufficient (<75 nmol/L) and 21% had deficient (<50 nmol/L)
plasma 25(OH)D concentration at enrollment. At birth, 74.4% of the infants had
insufficient and 30% had deficient plasma 25(OH)D concentrations, measured in
cord blood. Multivariate analysis controlling for maternal age and body mass
index (BMI) at enrollment and gestational age at delivery found that deficient
plasma 25(OH)D levels were associated with a four-fold higher risk of stunting in
neonates (p = 0.04). These findings add to the existing literature about vitamin 
D and its association with linear growth in resource-limited settings, though
randomized clinical trials are needed to establish causation.

BACKGROUND: Interventions to interrupt transmission of malaria from humans to
mosquitoes represent an appealing approach to assist malaria elimination. A
limitation has been the lack of systems to test the efficacy of such
interventions before proceeding to efficacy trials in the field. We have
previously demonstrated the feasibility of induced blood stage malaria (IBSM)
infection with Plasmodium vivax. In this study, we report further validation of
the IBSM model, and its evaluation for assessment of transmission of P. vivax to 
Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes.
METHODS: Six healthy subjects (three cohorts, n = 2 per cohort) were infected
with P. vivax by inoculation with parasitized erythrocytes. Parasite growth was
monitored by quantitative PCR, and gametocytemia by quantitative reverse
transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) for the mRNA pvs25. Parasite multiplication rate
(PMR) and size of inoculum were calculated by linear regression. Mosquito
transmission studies were undertaken by direct and membrane feeding assays over 3
days prior to commencement of antimalarial treatment, and midguts of blood fed
mosquitoes dissected and checked for presence of oocysts after 7-9 days.
RESULTS: The clinical course and parasitemia were consistent across cohorts, with
all subjects developing mild to moderate symptoms of malaria. No serious adverse 
events were reported. Asymptomatic elevated liver function tests were detected in
four of six subjects; these resolved without treatment. Direct feeding of
mosquitoes was well tolerated. The estimated PMR was 9.9 fold per cycle. Low
prevalence of mosquito infection was observed (1.8%; n = 32/1801) from both
direct (4.5%; n = 20/411) and membrane (0.9%; n = 12/1360) feeds.
CONCLUSION: The P. vivax IBSM model proved safe and reliable. The clinical course
and PMR were reproducible when compared with the previous study using this model.
The IBSM model presented in this report shows promise as a system to test
transmission-blocking interventions. Further work is required to validate
transmission and increase its prevalence.

BACKGROUND: Emergence of insecticide resistance in malaria vectors is a real
threat to future goals of elimination and control of malaria. Therefore, the
objective of this study was to assess research trend on insecticide resistance of
Anopheles mosquito. In specific, number of publications, countries, institutions,
and authors' research profile, citation analysis, international collaborations,
and impact of journals publishing documents on insecticide resistance will be
presented. It was conducted via Scopus search engine which was used to retrieve
relevant data. Keywords used were based on literature available on this topic.
The duration of study was set from 1996-2015.
RESULTS: A total of 616 documents, mainly as original research articles (n = 569;
92.37%) were retrieved. The average number of citations per article was 26.36.
Poisson log-linear regression analysis indicated that there was a 6.00% increase 
in the number of publications for each extra article on pyrethroid resistance. A 
total of 82 different countries and 1922 authors participated in publishing
retrieved articles. The United Kingdom (UK) ranked first in number of
publications followed by the United States of America (USA) and France. The top
ten productive countries included seven African countries. The UK had
collaborations mostly with Benin (relative link strength = 46). A total of 1817
institution/ organizations participated in the publication of retrieved articles.
The most active institution/ organization was Liverpool School of Tropical
Medicine. Retrieved articles were published in 134 different scientific peer
reviewed journals. The journal that published most on this topic was Malaria
Journal (n = 101; 16.4%). Four of the top active authors were from South Africa
and two were from the UK. Three of the top ten cited articles were published in
Insect Molecular Biology journal. Six articles were about pyrethroid resistance
and at least two were about DDT resistance.
CONCLUSION: Publications on insecticide resistance in malaria vector has gained
momentum in the past decade. International collaborations enhanced the knowledge 
about the situation of vector resistance in countries with endemic malaria.
Molecular biology of insecticide resistance is the key issue in understanding and
overcoming this emerging problems.

Intricacies of using temperature of different niches for assessing impact on
malaria transmission.

Singh P(1), Yadav Y(1), Saraswat S(1), Dhiman RC(1).

Author information: 
(1)National Institute of Malaria Research (ICMR), New Delhi, India.

BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: The influence of temperature on the life cycle of
mosquitoes as well as on development of malaria parasite in mosquitoes is well
studied. Most of the studies use outdoor temperature for understanding the
transmission dynamics and providing projections of malaria. As the mosquitoes
breed in water and rest usually indoors, it is logical to relate the transmission
dynamics with temperature of micro-niche. The present study was, therefore,
undertaken to understand the influence of different formats of temperature of
different micro-niches on transmission of malaria for providing more realistic
projections.
METHODS: The study was conducted in one village each of Assam and Uttarakhand s0 
tates of India. Temperatures recorded from outdoor (air) as well as indoor
habitats (resting place of mosquito) were averaged into daily, fortnightly and
monthly and were used for determination of transmission windows (TWs) for
Plasmodium vivax (Pv) and P. falciparum (Pf) based on minimum temperature
threshold required for transmission.
RESULTS: The daily temperature was found more useful for calculation of sporogony
than fortnightly and monthly temperatures. Monthly TWs were further refined using
fortnightly temperature, keeping in view the completion of more than one life
cycle of malaria vectors and sporogony of malaria parasite in a month. A linear
regression equation was generated to find out the relationship between outdoor
and indoor temperatures and R [2] to predict the percentage of variation in
indoor temperature as a function of outdoor temperature at both localities.
INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed that the indoor temperature was 
more than outdoors in stable malarious area (Assam) but fluctuating in low
endemic area like Uttarakhand. Transmission windows of malaria should be
determined by transforming outdoor data to indoor and preferably at fortnightly
interval. With daily recorded temperature, sporogonic and gonotrophic cycles can 
also be calculated which is otherwise not possible with monthly data. The study
highlights that the projections made for malaria in view of climate change need
to be seen with limitation of difference in outdoor and indoor temperatures at
different locations, highlighting the need for local data generation at least at 
sub-district level.

BACKGROUND: The Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and Multiple Indicator
Cluster Surveys (MICS) are the major data sources in low- and middle-income
countries (LMICs) for evaluating health service coverage. For certain maternal
and child health (MCH) indicators, the two surveys use different recall periods: 
5 years for DHS and 2 years for MICS.
OBJECTIVE: We explored whether the different recall periods for DHS and MICS
affect coverage trend analyses as well as missing data and coverage estimates.
DESIGNS: We estimated coverage, using proportions with 95% confidence intervals, 
for four MCH indicators: intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in
pregnancy, tetanus vaccination, early breastfeeding and postnatal care. Trends in
coverage were compared using data from 1) standard 5-year DHS and 2-year MICS
recall periods (unmatched) and 2) DHS restricted to 2-year recall to match the
MICS 2-year recall periods (matched). Linear regression was used to explore the
relationship between length of recall, missing data and coverage estimates.
RESULTS: Differences in coverage trends were observed between matched and
unmatched data in 7 of 18 (39%) comparisons performed. The differences were in
the direction of the trend over time, the slope of the coverage change or the
significance levels. Consistent trends were seen in 11 of the 18 (61%)
comparisons. Proportion of missing data was inversely associated with coverage
estimates in both short (2 years) and longer (5 years) recall of the DHS (r=-0.3,
p=0.02 and r=-0.4, p=0.004, respectively). The amount of missing information was 
increased for longer recall compared with shorter recall for all indicators
(significant odds ratios ranging between 1.44 and 7.43).
CONCLUSIONS: In a context where most LMICs are dependent on population-based
household surveys to derive coverage estimates, users of these types of data need
to ensure that variability in recall periods and the proportion of missing data
across data sources are appropriately accounted for when trend analyses are
conducted.

BACKGROUND: Serological markers for exposure to different Plasmodium species have
recently been used in multiplex immunoassays based on the Luminex technology.
However, interpretation of the assay results requires consideration of the
half-life of specific antibodies against these markers. Therefore, the aim of the
present study was to document the half-life of malaria specific serological
makers, as well as assessing the sensitivity of these markers to pick up recent
changes in malaria exposure.
METHODS: A recently developed multiplex immunoassay was used to measure the
intensity of antibody (Ab) responses against 19 different Plasmodium specific
antigens, covering different human malaria parasites and two vector saliva
antigens. Therefore, 8439 blood samples from five cross-sectional surveys in
Ratanakiri, Cambodia, were analysed. These involve a random selection from two
selected surveys, and an additional set of blood samples of individuals that were
randomly re-sampled three, four or five times. A generalized estimating equation 
model and linear regression models were fitted on log transformed antibody
intensity data.
RESULTS: Results showed that most (17/21) Ab-responses are higher in PCR positive
than PCR negative individuals. Furthermore, these antibody-responses follow the
same upward trend within each age group. Estimation of the half-lives showed
differences between serological markers that reflect short- (seasonal) and
long-term (year round) transmission trends. Ab levels declined significantly
together with a decrease of PCR prevalence in a group of malaria endemic
villages.
CONCLUSION: For Plasmodium falciparum, antibodies against LSA3.RE, GLURP and
Pf.GLURP.R2 are most likely to be a reflexion of recent (range from 6 to
8 months) exposure in the Mekong Subregion. PvEBP is the only Plasmodium vivax Ag
responding reasonably well, in spite of an estimated Ab half-life of more than
1 year. The use of Ab intensity data rather dichotomizing the continuous Ab-titre
data (positive vs negative) will lead to an improved approach for serological
surveillance.

OBJECTIVE: Tropical highland malaria intensifies and shifts to higher altitudes
during exceptionally warm years. Above-normal temperatures associated with El
Niño during boreal winter months (December-March) may intensify malaria in East
African highlands. We assessed the malaria risk for Oromia, the largest region of
Ethiopia with around 30 million inhabitants.
METHODS: Simple linear regression and spatial analyses were used to associate sea
surface temperatures (SST) in the Pacific and surface temperatures in Ethiopia
with annual malaria risk in Oromia, based on confirmed cases of malaria between
1982 and 2005.
RESULTS: A strong association (R2 = 0.6, P < 0.001) was identified between
malaria and sea surface temperatures in the Pacific, anticipating a 70% increase 
in malaria risk for the period from August 2016 to July 2017. This forecast was
quantitatively supported by elevated land surface temperatures (+1.6 °C) in
December 2015. When more station data become available and mean March 2016
temperatures from meteorological stations can be taken into account, a more
robust prediction can be issued.
CONCLUSION: An epidemic warning is issued for Oromia, Ethiopia, between August
2016 and July 2017 and may include the pre-July short malaria season. Similar
relationships reported for Madagascar point to an epidemic risk for all East
African highlands with around 150 million people. Preparedness for this high risk
period would include pre-emptive intradomestic spraying with insecticides,
adequate stocking of antimalarials, and spatial extension of diagnostic capacity 
and more frequent reporting to enable a rapid public health response when and
where required.

BACKGROUND: Scale-up of malaria prevention and treatment needs to continue to
further important gains made in the past decade, but national strategies and
budget allocations are not always evidence-based. Statistical models were
developed summarizing dynamically simulated relations between increases in
coverage and intervention impact, to inform a malaria module in the Spectrum
health programme planning tool.
METHODS: The dynamic Plasmodium falciparum transmission model OpenMalaria was
used to simulate health effects of scale-up of insecticide-treated net (ITN)
usage, indoor residual spraying (IRS), management of uncomplicated malaria cases 
(CM) and seasonal malaria chemoprophylaxis (SMC) over a 10-year horizon, over a
range of settings with stable endemic malaria. Generalized linear regression
models (GLMs) were used to summarize determinants of impact across a range of
sub-Sahara African settings.
RESULTS: Selected (best) GLMs explained 94-97 % of variation in simulated
post-intervention parasite infection prevalence, 86-97 % of variation in case
incidence (three age groups, three 3-year horizons), and 74-95 % of variation in 
malaria mortality. For any given effective population coverage, CM and ITNs were 
predicted to avert most prevalent infections, cases and deaths, with lower
impacts for IRS, and impacts of SMC limited to young children reached.
Proportional impacts were larger at lower endemicity, and (except for SMC)
largest in low-endemic settings with little seasonality. Incremental health
impacts for a given coverage increase started to diminish noticeably at above
~40 % coverage, while in high-endemic settings, CM and ITNs acted in synergy by
lowering endemicity. Vector control and CM, by reducing endemicity and acquired
immunity, entail a partial rebound in malaria mortality among people above
5 years of age from around 5-7 years following scale-up. SMC does not reduce
endemicity, but slightly shifts malaria to older ages by reducing immunity in
child cohorts reached.
CONCLUSION: Health improvements following malaria intervention scale-up vary with
endemicity, seasonality, age and time. Statistical models can emulate
epidemiological dynamics and inform strategic planning and target setting for
malaria control.

Accurate, sensitive, rapid, and easy operative diagnosis is necessary to prevent 
the spread of malaria. A cell microarray chip system including a push column for 
the recovery of erythrocytes and a fluorescence detector was employed for malaria
diagnosis in Uganda. The chip with 20,944 microchambers (105 μm width and 50 μm
depth) was made of polystyrene. For the analysis, 6 μl of whole blood was
employed, and leukocytes were practically removed by filtration through
SiO2-nano-fibers in a column. Regular formation of an erythrocyte monolayer in
each microchamber was observed following dispersion of an erythrocyte suspension 
in a nuclear staining dye, SYTO 21, onto the chip surface and washing. About
500,000 erythrocytes were analyzed in a total of 4675 microchambers, and malaria 
parasite-infected erythrocytes could be detected in 5 min by using the
fluorescence detector. The percentage of infected erythrocytes in each of 41
patients was determined. Accurate and quantitative detection of the parasites
could be performed. A good correlation between examinations via optical
microscopy and by our chip system was demonstrated over the parasitemia range of 
0.0039-2.3438% by linear regression analysis (R(2) = 0.9945). Thus, we showed the
potential of this chip system for the diagnosis of malaria.

BACKGROUND: Understanding malaria along the international border of two countries
is important for malaria control and elimination; however, it is difficult to
investigate a quantitative relationship between two countries' border areas due
to a shortage of malaria surveillance data.
METHODS: A linear regression analysis was conducted to investigate the
logarithmic annual parasite incidence (API), numbers of imported cases and local 
infections in 19 Chinese border counties, with logarithmic API and parasitic
prevalence in Myanmar's five special regions.
RESULTS: API in 19 Chinese counties was stronger correlated with parasite
prevalence than with API in five special regions of Myanmar, correlation
coefficient (R) 0.8322 (95 % CI 0.0636-0.9084) versus 0.9914 (95 % CI
0.9204-0.9914). Numbers of imported malaria cases and local malaria infections in
19 Chinese counties were also closer correlated with parasite prevalence than
with API in five special regions of Myanmar.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a strong correlation of malaria between China's side and
Myanmar's side along the international border. Parasite prevalence is a better
indicator of the true malaria situation in a setting without sound surveillance
and reporting system. China should reconsider its definition of imported malaria 
which neglects imported malaria by mosquitoes and asymptomatic parasite carriers.

Malaria is a serious public health threat in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), and its
transmission risk varies geographically. Modelling its geographic characteristics
is essential for identifying the spatial and temporal risk of malaria
transmission. Remote sensing (RS) has been serving as an important tool in
providing and assessing a variety of potential climatic/environmental malaria
transmission variables in diverse areas. This review focuses on the utilization
of RS-driven climatic/environmental variables in determining malaria transmission
in SSA. A systematic search on Google Scholar and the Institute for Scientific
Information (ISI) Web of Knowledge(SM) databases (PubMed, Web of Science and
ScienceDirect) was carried out. We identified thirty-five peer-reviewed articles 
that studied the relationship between remotely-sensed climatic variable(s) and
malaria epidemiological data in the SSA sub-regions. The relationship between
malaria disease and different climatic/environmental proxies was examined using
different statistical methods. Across the SSA sub-region, the normalized
difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from either the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer
(AVHRR) or Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) satellite sensors was
most frequently returned as a statistically-significant variable to model both
spatial and temporal malaria transmission. Furthermore, generalized linear models
(linear regression, logistic regression and Poisson regression) were the most
frequently-employed methods of statistical analysis in determining malaria
transmission predictors in East, Southern and West Africa. By contrast,
multivariate analysis was used in Central Africa. We stress that the utilization 
of RS in determining reliable malaria transmission predictors and
climatic/environmental monitoring variables would require a tailored approach
that will have cognizance of the geographical/climatic setting, the stage of
malaria elimination continuum, the characteristics of the RS variables and the
analytical approach, which in turn, would support the channeling of intervention 
resources sustainably.

BACKGROUND: Fever is an inherent symptom of malaria in both adults and children. 
Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is the recommended antipyretic as it is inexpensive, 
widely available and has a good safety profile, but patients may not be able to
take the oral drug reliably. A comparison between the pharmacokinetics of oral
syrup and intramuscular paracetamol given to patients with acute falciparum
malaria and high body temperature was performed.
METHODS: A randomized, open-label, two-treatment, crossover, pharmacokinetic
study of paracetamol dosed orally and intramuscularly was conducted. Twenty-one
adult patients with uncomplicated falciparum malaria were randomized to receive a
single 600 mg dose of paracetamol either as syrup or intramuscular injection on
day 0 followed by a single dose administered by the alternative route on day 1.
Paracetamol plasma concentrations were quantified frequently and modelled
simultaneously using nonlinear mixed-effects modelling. The final population
pharmacokinetic model was used for dose optimization simulations. Relationships
between paracetamol concentrations with temperature and parasite half-life were
investigated using linear and non-linear regression analyses.
RESULTS: The population pharmacokinetic properties of paracetamol were best
described by a two-compartment disposition model, with zero-order and first-order
absorption for intramuscular and oral syrup administration, respectively. The
relative bioavailability of oral syrup was 84.4 % (95 % CI 68.2-95.1 %) compared 
to intramuscular administration. Dosing simulations showed that 1000 mg of
intramuscular or oral syrup administered six-hourly reached therapeutic steady
state concentrations for antipyresis, but more favourable concentration-time
profiles were achieved with a loading dose of 1500 mg, followed by a 1000 mg
maintenance dose. This ensured that maximum therapeutic concentrations were
reached rapidly during the first 6 h. No significant relationships between
paracetamol concentrations and temperature or parasite half-life were found.
CONCLUSIONS: Paracetamol plasma concentrations after oral syrup and intramuscular
administration in patients with acute falciparum malaria were described
successfully by a two-compartment disposition model. Relative oral
bioavailability compared to intramuscular dosing was estimated as 84.4 % (95 % CI
68.2-95.1 %). Dosing simulations showed that a loading dose followed by
six-hourly dosing intervals reduced the time delay to reach therapeutic drug
levels after both routes of administration. The safety and efficacy of loading
dose paracetamol antipyretic regimens now needs to be established in larger
studies.

    Lancet. 2016 Jun 18;387(10037):2482-4.

BACKGROUND: Disbursements of development assistance for health (DAH) have risen
substantially during the past several decades. More recently, the international
community's attention has turned to other international challenges, introducing
uncertainty about the future of disbursements for DAH.
METHODS: We collected audited budget statements, annual reports, and
project-level records from the main international agencies that disbursed DAH
from 1990 to the end of 2015. We standardised and combined records to provide a
comprehensive set of annual disbursements. We tracked each dollar of DAH back to 
the source and forward to the recipient. We removed transfers between agencies to
avoid double-counting and adjusted for inflation. We classified assistance into
nine primary health focus areas: HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, maternal
health, newborn and child health, other infectious diseases, non-communicable
diseases, Ebola, and sector-wide approaches and health system strengthening. For 
our statistical analysis, we grouped these health focus areas into two
categories: MDG-related focus areas (HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, child and
newborn health, and maternal health) and non-MDG-related focus areas (other
infectious diseases, non-communicable diseases, sector-wide approaches, and
other). We used linear regression to test for structural shifts in disbursement
patterns at the onset of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs; ie, from 2000)
and the global financial crisis (impact estimated to occur in 2010). We built on 
past trends and associations with an ensemble model to estimate DAH through the
end of 2040.
FINDINGS: In 2015, US$36·4 billion of DAH was disbursed, marking the fifth
consecutive year of little change in the amount of resources provided by global
health development partners. Between 2000 and 2009, DAH increased at 11·3% per
year, whereas between 2010 and 2015, annual growth was just 1·2%. In 2015, 29·7% 
of DAH was for HIV/AIDS, 17·9% was for child and newborn health, and 9·8% was for
maternal health. Linear regression identifies three distinct periods of growth in
DAH. Between 2000 and 2009, MDG-related DAH increased by $290·4 million (95%
uncertainty interval [UI] 174·3 million to 406·5 million) per year. These
increases were significantly greater than were increases in non-MDG DAH during
the same period (p=0·009), and were also significantly greater than increases in 
the previous period (p<0·0001). Between 2000 and 2009, growth in DAH was highest 
for HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. Since 2010, DAH for maternal health and 
newborn and child health has continued to climb, although DAH for HIV/AIDS and
most other health focus areas has remained flat or decreased. Our estimates of
future DAH based on past trends and associations present a wide range of
potential futures, although our mean estimate of $64·1 billion (95% UI $30·4
billion to $161·8 billion) shows an increase between now and 2040, although with 
a large uncertainty interval.
INTERPRETATION: Our results provide evidence of two substantial shifts in DAH
growth during the past 26 years. DAH disbursements increased faster in the first 
decade of the 2000s than in the 1990s, but DAH associated with the MDGs increased
the most out of all focus areas. Since 2010, limited growth has characterised DAH
and we expect this pattern to persist. Despite the fact that DAH is still
growing, albeit minimally, DAH is shifting among the major health focus areas,
with relatively little growth for HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. These
changes in the growth and focus of DAH will have critical effects on health
services in some low-income countries. Coordination and collaboration between
donors and domestic governments is more important than ever because they have a
great opportunity and responsibility to ensure robust health systems and service 
provision for those most in need.

BACKGROUND: An understanding of the factors that affect the abundance of
Anopheline species provides an opportunity to better understand the dynamics of
malaria transmission in different regions. Chabahar, located south east of Iran, 
is the most malarious region in the country.
OBJECTIVE: The main aim of this study was to quantify the spatiotemporal
Anopheles population dynamics, response to climatic conditions in Chabahar.
METHODS: Satellite-based and land-based climatic data were used as explanatory
variables. Monthly caught mosquitoes in 6 village sites of Chabahar were used as 
dependent variable. The spatiotemporal associations were first investigated by
inspection of scatter plots and single variable regression analysis. A
multivariate linear regression model was developed to reveal the association
between environmental variables and the monthly mosquito abundance at a 95%
confidence level (P ≤ 0.5).
FINDINGS: Results indicated that Anopheles mosquitoes can be found all year in
Chabahar with 2 significant seasonal peaks from March to June (primary peak) and 
September to November (secondary peak). Results of the present study showed that 
0.77 of yearly mosquito abundance emerges in the thermal range of 24°C to 30°C
and the humidity range of 0.70 to 0.80 in Chabahar.
CONCLUSION: According to the developed multivariate linear model, 0.88 of
temporal variance of mosquito abundance, nighttime land surface temperature, and 
relative humidity of 15 Universal Time Coordinated (18.30 Iran) are the main
drivers of mosquito population dynamics in Chabahar.

BACKGROUND: Outbreaks of vector-borne diseases (VBDs) such as dengue and malaria 
can overwhelm health systems in resource-poor countries. Environmental management
strategies that reduce or eliminate vector breeding sites combined with improved 
personal prevention strategies can help to significantly reduce transmission of
these infections.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and
practices (KAPs) of residents in western Jamaica regarding control of mosquito
vectors and protection from mosquito bites.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted between May and August 2010 among 
patients or family members of patients waiting to be seen at hospitals in western
Jamaica. Participants completed an interviewer-administered questionnaire on
sociodemographic factors and KAPs regarding VBDs. KAP scores were calculated and 
categorized as high or low based on the number of correct or positive responses. 
Logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify predictors of KAP and
linear regression analysis conducted to determine if knowledge and attitude
scores predicted practice scores.
FINDINGS: In all, 361 (85 men and 276 women) people participated in the study.
Most participants (87%) scored low on knowledge and practice items (78%).
Conversely, 78% scored high on attitude items. By multivariate logistic
regression, housewives were 82% less likely than laborers to have high attitude
scores; homeowners were 65% less likely than renters to have high attitude
scores. Participants from households with 1 to 2 children were 3.4 times more
likely to have high attitude scores compared with those from households with no
children. Participants from households with at least 5 people were 65% less
likely than those from households with fewer than 5 people to have high practice 
scores. By multivariable linear regression knowledge and attitude scores were
significant predictors of practice score.
CONCLUSION: The study revealed poor knowledge of VBDs and poor prevention
practices among participants. It identified specific groups that can be targeted 
with vector control and personal protection interventions to decrease
transmission of the infections.

Antibodies that impede the invasion of Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum)
merozoites into erythrocytes play a critical role in anti-malarial immunity. The 
Growth Inhibition Assay (GIA) is an in vitro measure of the functional capacity
of such antibodies to limit erythrocyte invasion and/or parasite growth. Up to
now, it is unclear whether growth-inhibitory activity correlates with protection 
from clinical disease and there are inconsistent results from studies performed
with GIA. Studies that have focused on the relationship between IgGs and their in
vitro parasite Growth Inhibition Activity (GIAc) in infants aged less than two
years old are rare. Here, we used clinical and parasitological data to precisely 
define symptomatic or asymptomatic infection with P. falciparum in groups of
infants followed-up actively for 18 months post-natally. We quantified the levels
of IgG1 and IgG3 directed to a panel of candidate P. falciparum vaccine antigens 
(AMA-1, MSP1, 2, 3 and GLURP) using ELISA and the functional activity of IgG was 
quantified using GIA. Data were then correlated with individuals' infection
status. At 18 months of age, infants harbouring infections at the time of blood
sampling had an average 19% less GIAc than those not infected (p=0.004,
multivariate linear regression). GIAc decreased from 12 to 18 months of age
(p=0.003, Wilcoxon matched pairs test). Antibody levels quantified at 18 months
in infants were strongly correlated with their exposure to malarial infection,
however GIAc was not correlated with malaria infectious status (asymptomatic and 
symptomatic groups). In conclusion, both infection status at blood draw and age
influence parasite growth inhibition mediated by IgG in the GIA. Both factors
must be taken into account when correlations between GIAc and anti-malarial
protection or vaccine efficacy have to be made.

Distinct Transcriptional and Anti-Mycobacterial Profiles of Peripheral Blood
Monocytes Dependent on the Ratio of Monocytes: Lymphocytes.

Naranbhai V, Fletcher HA, Tanner R, O'Shea MK, McShane H, Fairfax BP, Knight JC, 
Hill AV.

The ratio of monocytes and lymphocytes (ML ratio) in peripheral blood is
associated with tuberculosis and malaria disease risk and cancer and
cardiovascular disease outcomes. We studied anti-mycobacterial function and the
transcriptome of monocytes in relation to the ML ratio. Mycobacterial growth
inhibition assays of whole or sorted blood were performed and mycobacteria were
enumerated by liquid culture. Transcriptomes of unstimulated CD14 + monocytes
isolated by magnetic bead sorting were characterised by microarray. Transcript
expression was tested for association with ML ratio calculated from leucocyte
differential counts by linear regression. The ML ratio was associated with
mycobacterial growth in vitro (β = 2.23, SE 0.91, p = 0.02). Using sorted
monocytes and lymphocytes, in vivo ML ratio (% variance explained R(2) = 11%, p =
0.02) dominated over in vitro ratios (R(2) = 5%, p = 0.10) in explaining
mycobacterial growth. Expression of 906 genes was associated with the ML ratio
and 53 with monocyte count alone. ML-ratio associated genes were enriched for
type-I and -II interferon signalling (p = 1.2 × 10(− 8)), and for genes under
transcriptional control of IRF1, IRF2, RUNX1, RELA and ESRRB. The
ML-ratio-associated gene set was enriched in TB disease (3.11-fold, 95% CI:
2.28-4.19, p = 5.7 × 10(− 12)) and other inflammatory diseases including atopy,
HIV, IBD and SLE. The ML ratio is associated with distinct transcriptional and
anti-mycobacterial profiles of monocytes that may explain the disease
associations of the ML ratio.

BACKGROUND: Malaria incidence has declined considerably over the last decade.
This is partly due to a scale-up of control measures but is also attributed to
increasing urbanization. This study aimed to analyse the association between
malaria and urbanization and the effect of urbanicity on the acquisition of
semi-immunity.
METHODS: In 2012, children with fever presenting to St Michael's Hospital
Pramso/Ghana were recruited. The malaria-positive-fraction (MPF) of fever cases
was calculated on community-level to approximate the malaria risk. The mean age
of malaria cases was calculated for each community to estimate the acquisition of
semi-immunity. The level of urbanicity for the communities was calculated and
associations between MPF, urbanicity and immunity were modelled using linear
regression.
RESULTS: Twenty-six villages were included into the study with a mean MPF of 35
%. A linear decrease of 5 % (95 % CI: 4-6 %) in MPF with every ten-point increase
in urbanicity was identified. The mean age of malaria patients increased by 2.9
months (95 % CI: 1.0-4.8) with every ten-point increase in urbanicity.
DISCUSSION: The results confirm an association between an increase in urbanicity 
and declining malaria risk and demonstrate that the acquisition of semi-immunity 
is heterogeneous on a micro-epidemiological scale and is associated with
urbanicity.

BACKGROUND: Large reductions in malaria transmission and mortality have been
achieved over the last decade, and this has mainly been attributed to the
scale-up of long-lasting insecticidal bed nets and indoor residual spraying with 
insecticides. Despite these gains considerable residual, spatially heterogeneous,
transmission remains. To reduce transmission in these foci, researchers need to
consider the local demographical, environmental and social context, and design an
appropriate set of interventions. Exploring spatially variable risk factors for
malaria can give insight into which human and environmental characteristics play 
important roles in sustaining malaria transmission.
METHODS: On Rusinga Island, western Kenya, malaria infection was tested by rapid 
diagnostic tests during two cross-sectional surveys conducted 3 months apart in
3632 individuals from 790 households. For all households demographic data were
collected by means of questionnaires. Environmental variables were derived using 
Quickbird satellite images. Analyses were performed on 81 project clusters
constructed by a traveling salesman algorithm, each containing 50-51 households. 
A standard linear regression model was fitted containing multiple variables to
determine how much of the spatial variation in malaria prevalence could be
explained by the demographic and environmental data. Subsequently, a
geographically-weighted regression (GWR) was performed assuming non-stationarity 
of risk factors. Special attention was taken to investigate the effect of
residual spatial autocorrelation and local multicollinearity.
RESULTS: Combining the data from both surveys, overall malaria prevalence was
24%. Scan statistics revealed two clusters which had significantly elevated
numbers of malaria cases compared to the background prevalence across the rest of
the study area. A multivariable linear model including environmental and
household factors revealed that higher socioeconomic status, outdoor occupation
and population density were associated with increased malaria risk. The local GWR
model improved the model fit considerably and the relationship of malaria with
risk factors was found to vary spatially over the island; in different areas of
the island socio-economic status, outdoor occupation and population density were 
found to be positively or negatively associated with malaria prevalence.
DISCUSSION: Identification of risk factors for malaria that vary geographically
can provide insight into the local epidemiology of malaria. Examining spatially
variable relationships can be a helpful tool in exploring which set of targeted
interventions could locally be implemented. Supplementary malaria control may be 
directed at areas, which are identified as at risk. For instance, areas with many
people that work outdoors at night may need more focus in terms of vector
control.

BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular parameters can be impaired by repeated infections with
P. falciparum. This study aimed at investigating the influence of gametocyte
carriage on; the prevalence of fever and splenomegaly, blood pressure, heart rate
and haematological indices in children <15 years, in the Mount Cameroon area.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out, from February to July 2013. A
child with axillary body temperature ≥37.5 °C was considered febrile and
splenomegaly was investigated by palpation. Systolic and diastolic blood
pressures as well as heart rate were assessed by non-invasive methods. Malaria
parasites were detected and density assessed from Giemsa-stained thin and thick
blood films. An auto haematology analyser was used to obtain complete blood count
values such as haemoglobin (Hb), haematocrit (Hct), red blood cell (RBC) and
white blood cell (WBC) counts, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular
haemoglobin concentration (MCHC), and mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH).
Univariate analyses were used to examine influence of gametocyte carriage on
fever and splenomegaly while, multiple linear regression models were used to
evaluate influence of independent variables on the dependent variables.
RESULTS: Of a total of 454 children examined, malaria parasitaemia, fever,
splenomegaly and gametocyte carriage were detected in 36.6, 21.6, 14.3 and 7.3 % 
of them respectively. Children who were asexual parasite and gametocyte positive 
(ASP + Gam Pos) had significantly highest (P = 0.03, P = 0.002) prevalence of
fever and splenomegaly (39.4 %, 33.3 %) respectively than their aparasitaemic
(AP) and asexual parasite positive (ASP Pos) equivalents (19.0 %, 10.9 % and 22.8
%, 16.9 % respectively). The presence of asexual malaria parasitaemia
significantly influenced the MCV (P = 0.03), MCH (P = 0.03) and heart beats /min 
(0.03) while gametocytaemia significantly influenced the Hb (P < 0.001), Hct
(P < 0.001), RBC (P < 0.001) and systolic blood pressure (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Gametocyte carriage significantly influenced the prevalence of fever,
splenomegaly and some cardiovascular indices. In effect, children concurrently
having asexual parasitaemia and gametocytes had significantly lower, Hct, Hb
levels, RBC and platelet counts and systolic blood pressure.

BACKGROUND: Hyperlactatemia is a strong predictor of mortality in severe
falciparum malaria. Sequestered parasitized erythrocytes and reduced uninfected
red blood cell deformability (RCD) compromise microcirculatory flow, leading to
anaerobic glycolysis.
METHODS: In a cohort of patients with falciparum malaria hospitalized in
Chittagong, Bangladesh, bulk RCD was measured using a laser diffraction
technique, and parasite biomass was estimated from plasma concentrations of
Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2). A multiple linear
regression model was constructed to examine their associations with plasma
lactate concentrations.
RESULTS: A total of 286 patients with falciparum malaria were studied, of whom
224 had severe malaria, and 70 died. Hyperlactatemia (lactate level, ≥ 4 mmol/L) 
was present in 111 cases. RCD at shear stresses of 1.7 Pa and 30 Pa was reduced
significantly in patients who died, compared with survivors, individuals with
uncomplicated malaria, or healthy individuals (P < .05, for all comparisons).
Multiple linear regression analysis showed that the plasma PfHRP2 level,
parasitemia level, total bilirubin level, and RCD at a shear stress of 1.7 Pa
were each independently correlated with plasma lactate concentrations (n = 278;
R(2) = 0.35).
CONCLUSIONS: Sequestration of parasitized red blood cells and reduced RCD both
contribute to decreased microcirculatory flow in severe disease.

BACKGROUND: Identification of plasmodial antigens targeted by protective immune
mechanisms is important for malaria vaccine development. Among functional assays,
the neutrophil antibody-dependent respiratory burst (ADRB) induced by opsonized
Plasmodium falciparum merozoites has been correlated with acquired immunity to
clinical malaria in endemic areas, but the target merozoite antigens are unknown.
Here, the contribution of antibodies to the conserved C-terminal domain of the P.
falciparum merozoite surface protein-1 (PfMSP1p19) in mediating ADRB was
investigated in sera from individuals living in two Senegalese villages with
differing malaria endemicity.
METHODS: Anti-PfMSP1p19 antibody levels in sera from 233 villagers were
investigated and the involvement of anti-PfMSP1p19 antibodies in ADRB was
explored in a subset of samples using (1) isogenic P. falciparum parasite clones 
expressing P. falciparum or Plasmodium chabaudi MSP1p19; (2) PfMSP1p19-coated
plaque ADRB; and, (3) ADRB triggering using sera depleted from PfMSP1p19
antibodies by absorption onto the baculovirus recombinant antigen.
RESULTS: ADRB activity correlated with anti-PfMSP1p19 IgG levels (P < 10(-3)). A 
substantial contribution of PfMSP1p19 antibody responses to ADRB was confirmed (P
< 10(-4)) in an age-adjusted linear regression model. PfMSP1p19 antibodies
accounted for 33.1 % (range 7-54 %) and 33.2 % (range 0-70 %) of ADRB activity
evaluated using isogenic merozoites (P < 10(-3)) and depleted sera (P = 0.0017), 
respectively. Coating of PfMSP1p19 on plates induced strong ADRB in
anti-PfMSP1p19-positive sera.
CONCLUSION: These data show that naturally acquired P. falciparum MSP1p19
antibodies are potent inducers of neutrophil ADRB and support the development of 
PfMSP1p19-based malaria vaccine using ADRB assay as a functional surrogate for
protection.

BACKGROUND: Malaria is a major public health problem worldwide. In Brazil, an
average of 420,000 cases of malaria have been reported annually in the last
12 years, of which 99.7 % occurred in the Amazon region. This study aimed to
analyse the distribution of malaria in the State of Amazonas and the influence of
indigenous malaria in this scenario, to evaluate the correlation between
incidence rates and socio-economic and environmental factors, and to evaluate the
performance of health surveillance services.
METHODS: This ecological study used secondary data obtained from the
SIVEP-MALARIA malaria surveillance programme. The relationship between
demographic, socio-economic and environmental factors, the performance of health 
surveillance services and the incidence of malaria in Amazonas, a multiple linear
regression model was used.
RESULTS: The crude rate of malaria in Amazonas was 4142.72 cases per 100,000
inhabitants between 2003 and 2012. The incidence rates for the indigenous and
non-indigenous populations were 12,976.02 and 3749.82, respectively, with an
indigenous population attributable fraction of only 8 %. The results of the
linear regression analysis indicated a negative correlation between the two
socio-economic indicators (municipal human development index (MHDI) and poverty
rate) and the incidence of malaria in the period. With regard to the
environmental indicators (average annual deforestation rate and percentage of
areas under the influence of watercourses), the correlation with the incidence
rate was positive.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings underscore the importance of implementing economic and 
social development policies articulated with strategic actions of environmental
protection and health care for the population.

Although banned in most countries, dichlorodiphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT)
continues to be used for vector control in some malaria endemic areas. Previous
findings from the Center for the Health Assessment of Mothers and Children of
Salinas (CHAMACOS) cohort study found increased prenatal levels of DDT and its
breakdown product dichlorodiphenyl-dichloroethylene (DDE) to be associated with
altered neurodevelopment in children at 1 and 2years of age. In this study, we
combined the measured maternal DDT/E concentrations during pregnancy obtained for
the prospective birth cohort with predicted prenatal DDT and DDE levels estimated
for a retrospective birth cohort. Using generalized estimating equation (GEE) and
linear regression models, we evaluated the relationship of prenatal maternal DDT 
and DDE serum concentrations with children's cognition at ages 7 and 10.5years as
assessed using the Full Scale Intelligence Quotient (IQ) and 4 subtest scores
(Working Memory, Perceptual Reasoning, Verbal Comprehension, and Processing
Speed) of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC). In GEE analyses
incorporating both age 7 and 10.5 scores (n=619), we found prenatal DDT and DDE
levels were not associated with Full Scale IQ or any of the WISC subscales
(p-value>0.05). In linear regression analyses assessing each time point
separately, prenatal DDT levels were inversely associated with Processing Speed
at age 7years (n=316), but prenatal DDT and DDE levels were not associated with
Full Scale IQ or any of the WISC subscales at age 10.5years (n=595). We found
evidence for effect modification by sex. In girls, but not boys, prenatal DDE
levels were inversely associated with Full Scale IQ and Processing Speed at age
7years. We conclude that prenatal DDT levels may be associated with delayed
Processing Speed in children at age 7years and the relationship between prenatal 
DDE levels and children's cognitive development may be modified by sex, with
girls being more adversely affected.

Malaria is a parasitic disease caused by five different species of Plasmodium.
More than 40% of the world's population is at risk and malaria annual incidence
is estimated to be more than two hundred million, malaria is one of the most
important public health problems especially in children of the poorest parts of
the world, annual mortality is about 1 million. The epidemiological status of the
disease justifies to search for control measures, new therapeutic options and
development of an effective vaccine. Chemotherapy options in malaria are limited,
moreover, drug resistant rate is high. In spite of global efforts to develop an
effective vaccine yet there is no vaccine available. In the current study, a
series of quinolone derivatives were subjected to quantitative structure activity
relationship (QSAR) and quantitative structure toxicity relationship (QSTR)
analyses to identify the ideal physicochemical characteristics of potential
anti-malaria activity and less cytotoxicity. Quinolone with desirable properties 
was built using HyperChem program, and conformational studies were performed
through the semi-empirical method followed by the PM3 force field. Multi linear
regression (MLR) was used as a chemo metric tool for quantitative structure
activity relationship modeling and the developed models were shown to be
statistically significant according to the validation parameters. The obtained
QSAR model reveals that the descriptors PJI2, Mv, PCR, nBM, and VAR mainly affect
the anti-malaria activity and descriptors MSD, MAXDP, and X1sol affect the
cytotoxicity of the series of ligands.

BACKGROUND: Integrated community case management (iCCM) relies on community
health workers (CHWs) managing children with malaria, pneumonia, diarrhoea, and
referring children when management is not possible. This study sought to
establish the cost per sick child referred to seek care from a higher-level
health facility by a CHW and to estimate caregivers' willingness to pay (WTP) for
referral.
METHODS: Caregivers of 203 randomly selected children referred to higher-level
health facilities by CHWs were interviewed in four Midwestern Uganda districts.
Questionnaires and document reviews were used to capture direct, indirect and
opportunity costs incurred by caregivers, CHWs and health facilities managing
referred children. WTP for referral was assessed through the 'bidding game'
approach followed by an open-ended question on maximum WTP. Descriptive analysis 
was conducted for factors associated with referral completion and WTP using
logistic and linear regression methods, respectively. The cost per case referred 
to higher-level health facilities was computed from a societal perspective.
RESULTS: Reasons for referral included having fever with a negative malaria test 
(46.8%), danger signs (29.6%) and drug shortage (37.4%). Among the referred, less
than half completed referral (45.8%). Referral completion was 2.8 times higher
among children with danger signs (p = 0.004) relative to those without danger
signs, and 0.27 times lower among children who received pre-referral treatment
(p < 0.001). The average cost per case referred was US$ 4.89 and US$7.35 per case
completing referral. For each unit cost per case referred, caregiver out of
pocket expenditure contributed 33.7%, caregivers' and CHWs' opportunity costs
contributed 29.2% and 5.1% respectively and health facility costs contributed
39.6%. The mean (SD) out of pocket expenditure was US$1.65 (3.25). The mean WTP
for referral was US$8.25 (14.70) and was positively associated with having
received pre-referral treatment, completing referral and increasing caregiver
education level.
CONCLUSION: The mean WTP for referral was higher than the average out of pocket
expenditure. This, along with suboptimal referral completion, points to barriers 
in access to higher-level facilities as the primary cause of low referral.
Community mobilisation for uptake of referral is necessary if the policy of
referring children to the nearest health facility is to be effective.

This study aimed to investigate coagulation, fibrinolysis indicators, and malaria
during pregnancy. Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted at Medani,
Sudan. Sociodemographic characteristics were gathered from each parturient woman 
(163) and malaria was investigated by blood film and placental histology. Protein
C, protein S, antithrombin-III, tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), and
plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 levels (PAI-1) were measured using ELISA.
Results. One (0.6%), three (1.8), and 19 (11.7%) of the placentae showed active, 
chronic, and past infection on a histopathological examination, respectively,
while 140 (85.9%) of them showed no signs of malaria infection. While the mean
[SD] of the protein C, antithrombin-III, and TFPI was significantly lower, there 
was no significant difference in protein S and PAI-1 levels in women with
placental malaria infection (n = 23) compared to those without placental malaria 
infection (140). In linear regression, placental malaria infection was associated
with antithrombin-III. There was no association between placental malaria
infections and protein C, protein S, TFPI, and PAI-1 levels. There was no
association between hemoglobin, birth weight, and the investigated coagulation
and fibrinolysis indicators. Conclusion. This study showed significantly lower
levels of protein C, antithrombin-III, and TFPI in women with placental malaria
infections.

BACKGROUND: Low birth weight (LBW) remains the main cause of mortality and
morbidity in infants, and a problem in the care of pregnant women world-wide
particularly in developing countries. The purpose of this study was to describe
the socio-demographic, nutritional, reproductive, medical and obstetrical risk
factors for delivering a live LBW infant at Harare Maternity Hospital, Zimbabwe.
METHODS: A secondary data analysis from data obtained through a questionnaire and
delivery records was conducted. Linear regression models with a complimentary
log-log link function were used to estimate the relative risks for all LBW, term 
LBW and preterm LBW.
RESULTS: The frequency of LBW was 16.7%. Lack of prenatal care (adjusted relative
risk [ARR] 1.69, 95% CI 1.44, 1.98), mother's mid-arm circumference below 28.5
cm, (ARR 1.35, 95% CI 1.19, 1.54) and rural residence (ARR 1.22, 95% CI 1.04,
1.40) increased the risk of LBW. Eclampsia, anemia, and ante-partum hemorrhage,
were associated with LBW (ARR 2.64, 95% CI 1.30, 5.35; ARR = 2.63, 95% CI 1.16,
5.97; and ARR = 2.39, 95% CI 1.55, 3.68), respectively. Malaria increased the
risk of LBW (ARR = 1.89, 95% CI 1.21, 2.96). Prenatal care, infant sex, anemia,
antepartum hemorrhage, premature rapture of membranes and preterm labor were
associated with the three LBW categories. History of abortion or stillbirth,
history of LBW, malaria, eclampsia, and placenta Previa, were associated with all
LBW and preterm LBW, while pregnancy induced hypertension, and number of children
alive were associated with all LBW and term LBW.
CONCLUSIONS: LBW frequency remains high and is associated with nutritive,
reproductive, medical and obstetrical factors. Preterm LBW and term LBW have
similar and also different risk factors. Understanding the role of different risk
factors in these different LBW categories is important if the goal is to reduce
LBW frequency, and its complications, in Zimbabwe.

BACKGROUND: Trends in prevalence of opportunistic infections (OIs) associated
with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in resource poor settings have
previously not been well documented. The objective of this study was to describe 
the trends in prevalence of Diarrhoea, Bacterial pneumonia, Kaposi's sarcoma,
Malaria and Geohelminths among HIV positive individuals over a 12 year period in 
Uganda.
METHODS: Observation data for 5972 HIV positive individuals enrolled with the
AIDS support organisation (TASO) in Uganda were analysed. Study participants were
drawn from three HIV clinics located in different geographical areas of Uganda
and followed from January 2002 to December 2013. The prevalence trends for the
above OIs were plotted using the Box Jenkins moving average technique. X (2)-test
for trend was used to test for the significance of the trends and Pearson's
correlation coefficient used to test for the strength of linear relationship
between OI prevalence and calendar time. Mixed effect linear regression was used 
to estimate average monthly change in prevalence with monthly variation modelled 
as a random effect.
RESULTS: A total of 204,871 monthly medical reports were retrieved and analysed. 
73 % (4301/5972) were female with a median age of 32 years (inter-quartile range 
26-39). Overall, significant decreasing mean annual prevalence trends (p < 0.05, 
X(2) trend) were observed for Diarrhoea (<1 month) with Pearson's correlation
coefficient (r = -0.89), Malaria (r = -0.75), Bacterial Pneumonia (r = -0.52),
and Geohelminth (r = -0.32). Non-significant increasing mean annual prevalence
trend was observed for Kaposis sarcoma (p = 0.20, X(2) trend; r = +0.26). After
adjusting for age, sex and clinic in a mixed effects linear regression model,
average monthly prevalence declined significantly at a rate of 0.4 % for Kaposis 
sarcoma, 0.3 % for Geohelminths, 2 % for Malaria, 1 % for Bacterial Pneumonia and
3 % for Diarrhoea(<1 month). However, the rate of decline per month differed
significantly (p < 0.05) by HIV clinic for Diarrhoea (<1 month), and age, sex and
clinic for malaria.
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Overall, decreasing trends were observed in the 
above OIs. However the trends differed significantly by OI, geographical location
and demographic characteristics. There is urgent need to integrate interventions 
targeting malaria and geohelminths in HIV programmes.

INTRODUCTION: Cameroon is classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as
having a critical shortage of health personnel. This is further complicated by
the geographic distributional inequalities of the national health workforce. This
shortfall impedes Cameroons' progress of improving the human resources for health
(HRH) to meet up with the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015. However,
it is unknown whether the health workforce of Cameroon is distributed equally
across geographic regions. Additionally, indicators other than population levels 
have not been used to measure health care needs. This study aimed to assess the
adequacy, evenness of distribution and challenges faced by the health workforce
across the different regions of Cameroon.
METHODS: National health personnel availability and distribution were assessed by
use of end-of-year census data for 2011 obtained from the MoPH data base. The
inequalities and distribution of the workforce were estimated using Gini
coefficient and Lorenz curve and linear regression was used to determine the
relation between health personnel density and selected health outcomes.
Alternative indicators to determine health care needs were illustrated using
concentration curves.
RESULTS: Significant geographic inequalities in the availability of health
workforce exist in Cameroon. Some regions have a higher number of physicians (per
person) than others leading to poor health outcomes across the regions. 70 % of
regions have a density of health personnel-to-population per 1,000 that is less
than 1.5, implying acute shortage of health personnel. Poor working and living
conditions, coupled with limited opportunities for career progress accounted for 
some documented 232 physicians and 205 nurses that migrated from the public
sector. Significant distributional inequality was noticed when under-five infant 
mortality and malaria prevalence rate were used as indicators to measure health
care needs.
CONCLUSION: Our results show an absolute shortage of public health personnel in
Cameroon that is further complicated by the geographic distributional
inequalities across the regions of the nation. Cameroon aims to achieve universal
health coverage by 2035; to realize this objective, policies targeting training, 
recruitment, retention and effective deployment of motivated and supported health
workforce as well as the development and improvement of health infrastructures
remain the major challenge.

BACKGROUND: Though essential to the development and evaluation of national
malaria control programmes, precise enumeration of the clinical illness burden of
malaria in endemic countries remains challenging where local surveillance systems
are incomplete. Strategies to infer annual incidence rates from parasite
prevalence survey compilations have proven effective in the specific case of
Plasmodium falciparum, but have yet to be developed for Plasmodium vivax.
Moreover, defining the relationship between P. vivax prevalence and clinical
incidence may also allow levels of endemicity to be inferred for areas where the 
information balance is reversed, that is, incident case numbers are more widely
gathered than parasite surveys; both applications ultimately facilitating
cartographic estimates of P. vivax transmission intensity and its ensuring
disease burden.
METHODS: A search for active case detection surveys was conducted and the
recorded incidence values were matched to local, contemporary parasite rate
measures and classified to geographic zones of differing relapse phenotypes. A
hierarchical Bayesian model was fitted to these data to quantify the relationship
between prevalence and incidence while accounting for variation among relapse
zones.
RESULTS: The model, fitted with 176 concurrently measured P. vivax incidence and 
prevalence records, was a linear regression of the logarithm of incidence against
the logarithm of age-standardized prevalence. Specific relationships for the six 
relapse zones where data were available were drawn, as well as a pooled overall
relationship. The slope of the curves varied among relapse zones; zones with
short predicted time to relapse had steeper slopes than those observed to contain
long-latency relapse phenotypes.
CONCLUSIONS: The fitted relationships, along with appropriate uncertainty
metrics, allow for estimates of clinical incidence of known confidence to be made
from wherever P. vivax prevalence data are available. This is a prerequisite for 
cartographic-based inferences about the global burden of morbidity due to P.
vivax, which will be used to inform control efforts.

BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of malaria during pregnancy is not completely
understood. There are few published data on complement activation and malaria
during pregnancy. This study aimed to investigate complement activation and
malaria during pregnancy, and their association with hemoglobin and birth weight.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted at Medani, Sudan. Soluble terminal
complement complex (TCC) levels were measured using ELISA in maternal and cord
blood samples from 126 parturient women.
RESULTS: There were no Plasmodium falciparum-positive blood films from maternal
peripheral blood, the placenta, or cord blood samples. Three (2.4%) and 22
(17.5%) of the placentas showed chronic and previous infection with
histopathological examination, respectively, while 101 (80.2%) of them had no
malaria infection. The mean [SD] of the maternal (22.4 [6.1] vs. 26.5 [3.5]
ng/ml, P < 0.001) and cord blood (24.5 [4.5] vs. 26.8 [4.4] ng/ml, P = 0.024) TCC
levels were significantly lower in cases of placental malaria infection (n = 25) 
than in those without placental malaria infection (n = 101). Linear regression
showed that placental malaria infection was significantly associated with birth
weight (-0.353 g, P = 0.013), but there were no associations between maternal and
cord TCC levels and maternal hemoglobin, or between TCC levels and birth weight.
CONCLUSION: Maternal and cord blood TCC levels are lower in women with placental 
malaria infection than in those without placental malaria infection.

BACKGROUND: In the last decade, several epidemiological studies have demonstrated
the potential of using seroprevalence (SP) and seroconversion rate (SCR) as
informative indicators of malaria burden in low transmission settings or in
populations on the cusp of elimination. However, most of studies are designed to 
control ensuing statistical inference over parasite rates and not on these
alternative malaria burden measures. SP is in essence a proportion and, thus,
many methods exist for the respective sample size determination. In contrast,
designing a study where SCR is the primary endpoint, is not an easy task because 
precision and statistical power are affected by the age distribution of a given
population.
METHODS: Two sample size calculators for SCR estimation are proposed. The first
one consists of transforming the confidence interval for SP into the
corresponding one for SCR given a known seroreversion rate (SRR). The second
calculator extends the previous one to the most common situation where SRR is
unknown. In this situation, data simulation was used together with linear
regression in order to study the expected relationship between sample size and
precision.
RESULTS: The performance of the first sample size calculator was studied in terms
of the coverage of the confidence intervals for SCR. The results pointed out to
eventual problems of under or over coverage for sample sizes ≤250 in very low and
high malaria transmission settings (SCR ≤ 0.0036 and SCR ≥ 0.29, respectively).
The correct coverage was obtained for the remaining transmission intensities with
sample sizes ≥ 50. Sample size determination was then carried out for
cross-sectional surveys using realistic SCRs from past sero-epidemiological
studies and typical age distributions from African and non-African populations.
For SCR < 0.058, African studies require a larger sample size than their
non-African counterparts in order to obtain the same precision. The opposite
happens for the remaining transmission intensities. With respect to the second
sample size calculator, simulation unravelled the likelihood of not having enough
information to estimate SRR in low transmission settings (SCR ≤ 0.0108). In that 
case, the respective estimates tend to underestimate the true SCR. This problem
is minimized by sample sizes of no less than 500 individuals. The sample sizes
determined by this second method highlighted the prior expectation that, when SRR
is not known, sample sizes are increased in relation to the situation of a known 
SRR. In contrast to the first sample size calculation, African studies would now 
require lesser individuals than their counterparts conducted elsewhere,
irrespective of the transmission intensity.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the proposed sample size calculators can be instrumental to
design future cross-sectional surveys, the choice of a particular sample size
must be seen as a much broader exercise that involves weighting statistical
precision with ethical issues, available human and economic resources, and
possible time constraints. Moreover, if the sample size determination is carried 
out on varying transmission intensities, as done here, the respective sample
sizes can also be used in studies comparing sites with different malaria
transmission intensities. In conclusion, the proposed sample size calculators are
a step towards the design of better sero-epidemiological studies. Their basic
ideas show promise to be applied to the planning of alternative sampling schemes 
that may target or oversample specific age groups.

BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum exports antigens to the surface of infected
erythrocytes causing cytoadhesion to the host vasculature. This is central in
malaria pathogenesis but in vitro studies of cytoadhesion rely mainly on manual
counting methods. The current study aimed at developing an automated
high-throughput method for this purpose utilizing the pseudoperoxidase activity
of intra-erythrocytic haemoglobin.
METHODS: Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were grown to confluence in chamber
slides and microtiter plates. Cytoadhesion of co-cultured P. falciparum, selected
for binding to CHO cells, was quantified by microscopy of Giemsa-stained chamber 
slides. In the automated assay, binding was quantified spectrophotometrically in 
microtiter plates after cell lysis using tetramethylbenzidine as
peroxidase-catalysed substrate. The relevance of the method for binding studies
was assessed using: i) binding of P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes to CHO
cells over-expressing chondroitin sulfate A and ii) CHO cells transfected with
CD36. Binding of infected erythrocytes including field isolates to primary
endothelial cells was also performed. Data was analysed using linear regression
and Bland-Altman plots.
RESULTS: The manual and automated quantification showed strong, positive
correlation (r(2) = 0.959, p <0.001) and with similar detection limit and
precision. The automated assay showed the expected dose-dependent reduction in
binding to CHO cells when blocking with soluble chondroitin sulfate A or
anti-CD36 antibody. Quantification of binding to endothelial cells showed clear
distinction between selected vs. non-selected parasite lines. Importantly, the
assay was sufficiently sensitive to detect adhesion of field isolates to
endothelial cells.
CONCLUSIONS: The assay is simple and in a reproducible manner quantifies
erythrocyte adhesion to several types of immobilized cells.

Leishmaniasis has emerged as the third most prevalent parasite-borne disease
worldwide after malaria and filariasis, with about 350 million people at risk of 
infection. Antileishmanial drugs currently available have various limitations,
mainly because of the parasite resistance and side effects. The search of new
antileishmanial drugs is ventured throughout the world.PURPOSE: The purpose of
this study was to assess the leishmanicidal activity of lipophilic extracts of
eight Hypericum species against promastigote forms of Leishmania (Leishmania)
amazonensis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The dried and powered materials of aerial parts of H.
andinum Gleason, H. brevistylum Choisy, H. caprifoliatum Cham. & Schltdl., H.
carinatum Griseb., H. linoides A. St.-Hil., H. myrianthum Cham. & Schltdl., H.
polyanthemum Klotzsch ex Reichardt and H. silenoides Juss. were extracted by
static maceration with n-hexane. Extracts were evaporated to dryness under
reduced pressure and stored at -20°C until biological evaluation and HPLC
analysis. The metabolites investigated were dimeric phloroglucinol derivatives,
benzophenones and benzopyrans. The yields were expressed as mean of three
injections in mg of compound per g of extract (mg/g extract). The effect of
Hypericum species on the viability of infective forms of L. (L.) amazonensis was 
determined using a hemocytometer. Amphotericin B was used as a standard drug. The
50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values for each extract were determined by
linear regression analysis. The cytotoxic effects of extracts were assessed on
peritoneal macrophages of BALB/c mice by MTT assay. The concentration that causes
50% of macrophage cytotoxicity (CC50) was determined by linear regression
analysis. The selectivity index (SI) of the extracts was determined considering
the following equation: CC50 against mammalian cells/IC50 against L. amazonensis.
RESULTS: We demonstrated that H. carinatum, H. linoides and H. polyanthemum were 
able to kill the parasites in a dose dependent manner. These extracts presented
low cytotoxicity against murine macrophages. At 48h of incubation H. polyanthemum
presented significant leishmanicidal activity with a 50% inhibitory concentration
(IC50) of 36.1µg/ml. The leishmanicidal activity of H. myrianthum was
significantly lower than that presented by H. polyanthemum, H. carinatum and H.
linoides extracts. H. brevistylum and H. caprifoliatum showed significant
leishmanicidal activity only at high concentrations (500 and 1000µg/ml), while H.
andinum and H. silenoides were ineffective.
CONCLUSION: The promising results demonstrate the importance of the species of
the genus Hypericum as source of compounds potentially useful for the treatment
of leishmaniasis.

BACKGROUND: Malaria transmission is perennial in the Assam-Arunachal Pradesh
interstate border areas in the Sonitpur district of Assam, India. A yearlong
study was carried out on the incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic malaria
and the role of asymptomatic malaria carriers in persistent transmission of the
disease. The relationships between malaria incidence and weather parameters were 
also investigated.
METHODS: Active and mass blood surveys were conducted on a monthly basis in
Bengenajuli, Sapairaumari Pathar, and Nigam villages near the Assam-Arunachal
Pradesh border. Epidemiological indices were estimated for malaria-positive
cases. Multiple linear regression between monthly malaria incidence and monthly
average temperature, and relative humidity along with monthly total rainfall was 
carried out. The known malaria vectors collected in CDC light traps were
identified and recorded.
RESULTS: Slide positivity rate (SPR) and Plasmodium falciparum percent (Pf%) for 
symptomatic malaria were 26.1 and 79.8, respectively. Prevalence of malaria
vectors was observed throughout the year with varying density. Anopheles
philippinensis/nivipes and A. annularis were predominant among the seven known
vector species recorded currently. Asymptomatic parasitemia was detected
throughout the year with SPR ranging from 4.8 to 5.3. Monthly rainfall with
1-month lag had the highest correlation (r=0.92) with SPR. The relationship
between SPR and weather factors was established as SPR=-114.22+0.58 Tmin+1.38
RH+0.03 RF (R2=0.89; p=0.00).
CONCLUSION: Low and relatively constant levels of asymptomatic parasitemia was
present in the study area. High malaria vector density and presence of
asymptomatic malaria parasite carriers were responsible for persistent malaria
transmission in the region. This study concludes that passive detection and
prompt treatment of asymptomatic carriers is essential for preventing persistent 
disease transmission. Rainfall along with some other weather variables may be
used for predicting the malaria epidemics in the region. The predictive
information could be useful to target resources more effectively.

A series of quinolon-4(1H)-imines have been recently discovered as antimalarials,
targeting both the exoerythrocytic and erythrocytic stages of the parasite's
development stages, which correspond to the phase of clinical symptoms. Endowed
with chemical and metabolic stability, the quinolon-4(1H)- imines are thus
presented as promissory dual-stage antimalarials. Three versions of multivariate 
image analysis applied to quantitative structure-activity relationship (MIA-QSAR)
methods, namely traditional MIA-QSAR, augmented MIA-QSAR (aug-MIA-QSAR) and
color-encoded aug-MIA-QSAR (aug- MIA-QSARcolor), were applied to model the
antimalarial activities in this series of compounds. The multiple linear
regression models indicated that the aug-MIA-QSAR method is more predictive and
reliable than the others (R(2) = 0.8079, R(2)cv = 0.6647 and R(2)pred = 0.9691)
for this series of compounds. The selected aug- MIA-QSAR descriptors were used
for pattern recognition using discriminant analysis by partial least squares
(PLS-DA), in order to separate compounds with low, moderate and high
bioactivities.

BACKGROUND: BCG is used widely as the sole licensed vaccine against tuberculosis,
but it has variable efficacy and the reasons for this are still unclear. No
reliable biomarkers to predict future protection against, or acquisition of, TB
infection following immunisation have been identified. Lessons from BCG could be 
valuable in the development of effective tuberculosis vaccines.
OBJECTIVES: Within the Entebbe Mother and Baby Study birth cohort in Uganda,
infants received BCG at birth. We investigated factors associated with latent
tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and with cytokine response to mycobacterial antigen
at age five years. We also investigated whether cytokine responses at one year
were associated with LTBI at five years of age.
METHODS: Blood samples from age one and five years were stimulated using crude
culture filtrates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in a six-day whole blood assay.
IFN-γ, IL-5, IL-13 and IL-10 production was measured. LTBI at five years was
determined using T-SPOT.TB(®) assay. Associations with LTBI at five years were
assessed using multivariable logistic regression. Multiple linear regression with
bootstrapping was used to determine factors associated with cytokine responses at
age five years.
RESULTS: LTBI prevalence was 9% at age five years. Only urban residence and
history of TB contact/disease were positively associated with LTBI. BCG vaccine
strain, LTBI, HIV infection, asymptomatic malaria, growth z-scores, childhood
anthelminthic treatment and maternal BCG scar were associated with cytokine
responses at age five. Cytokine responses at one year were not associated with
acquisition of LTBI by five years of age.
CONCLUSION: Although multiple factors influenced anti-myocbacterial immune
responses at age five, factors likely to be associated with exposure to
infectious cases (history of household contact, and urban residence) dominated
the risk of LTBI.

BACKGROUND: Although many malaria control programmes in sub-Saharan Africa use
indoor residual spraying with long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs), the two
studies assessing the benefit of the combination of these two interventions gave 
conflicting results. We aimed to assess whether the addition of indoor residual
spraying to LLINs provided a significantly different level of protection against 
clinical malaria in children or against house entry by vector mosquitoes.
METHODS: In this two-arm cluster, randomised, controlled efficacy trial we
randomly allocated clusters of Gambian villages using a computerised algorithm to
LLINs alone (n=35) or indoor residual spraying with
dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane plus LLINs (n=35). In each cluster, 65-213
children, aged 6 months to 14 years, were surveyed at the start of the 2010
transmission season and followed in 2010 and 2011 by passive case detection for
clinical malaria. Exposure to parasite transmission was assessed by collection of
vector mosquitoes with both light and exit traps indoors. Primary endpoints were 
the incidence of clinical malaria assessed by passive case detection and number
of Anopheles gambiae sensu lato mosquitoes collected per light trap per night.
Intervention teams had no role in data collection and the data collection teams
were not informed of the spray status of villages. The trial is registered at the
ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN01738840.
FINDINGS: LLIN coverage in 2011 was 3510 (93%) of 3777 children in the indoor
residual spraying plus LLIN group and 3622 (95.5%) of 3791 in the LLIN group. In 
2010, 7845 children were enrolled, 7829 completed passive case detection, and
7697 (98%) had complete clinical and covariate data. In 2011, 7009 children
remained in the study, 648 more were enrolled, 7657 completed passive case
detection, and 7545 (98.5%) had complete data. Indoor residual spraying coverage 
per cluster was more than 80% for both years in the indoor residual spraying plus
LLIN group. Incidence of clinical malaria was 0.047 per child-month at risk in
the LLIN group and 0.044 per child-month at risk in the indoor residual spraying 
plus LLIN group in 2010, and 0.032 per child-month at risk in the LLIN group and 
0.034 per child-month at risk in the indoor residual spraying plus LLIN group in 
2011. The incident rate ratio was 1.08 (95% CI 0.80-1.46) controlling for
confounders and cluster by mixed-effect negative binomial regression on all
malaria attacks for both years. No significant difference was recorded in the
density of vector mosquitoes caught in light traps in houses over the two
transmission seasons; the mean number of A gambiae sensu lato mosquitoes per trap
per night was 6.7 (4.0-10.1) in the LLIN group and 4.5 (2.4-7.4) in the indoor
residual spraying plus LLIN group (p=0.281 in the random-effects linear
regression model).
INTERPRETATION: We identified no significant difference in clinical malaria or
vector density between study groups. In this area with high LLIN coverage,
moderate seasonal transmission, and susceptible vectors, indoor residual spraying
did not provide additional benefit.

BACKGROUND: Solid organ transplant recipients are particularly vulnerable for
infectious diseases due to prolonged immunosuppressive treatment. Residents of
endemic regions and travellers may be exposed to malaria and may, therefore,
require prolonged antimalarial chemoprophylaxis. The hypothesis of this study was
that certain immunosuppressive drugs may exert clinically relevant anti-malarial 
activity. It was therefore designed to assess the intrinsic anti-malarial
activity of everolimus, mycophenolic acid, and rapamycin against Plasmodium
falciparum in an in vitro model.
METHODS: Three laboratory adapted clones of P. falciparum and two isolates were
used to assess the potential of mycophenolic acid, rapamycin and everolimus to
inhibit in vitro growth of P. falciparum. The standard histidine rich protein 2
assay was employed and inhibitory drug concentrations (IC) were computed by
non-linear regression analysis.
RESULTS: All drugs were associated with complete inhibition of P. falciparum
growth in in vitro assays. Mycophenolic acid demonstrated IC(50) and IC(90)
values of 5.4 μmol/L and 15.3 μmol/L. Rapamycin inhibited P. falciparum growth at
7.2 μmol/L (IC(50)) and 12.5 μmol/L (IC(90)), respectively. Finally, everolimus
displayed IC(50) and IC(90) values of 6.2 μmol/L and 11.5 μmol/L. There was no
difference in in vitro activity against chloroquine sensitive or chloroquine
resistant parasites.
CONCLUSIONS: All immunosuppressive drugs evaluated in this in vitro study
demonstrated activity against P. falciparum. Inhibitory concentrations of
mycophenolic acid are within clinically achievable plasma concentrations when
used in solid organ transplant recipients. Further in vivo evaluation of
mycophenolic acid either alone or in combination regimens may prove promising for
the concomitant prevention of P. falciparum in solid organ transplant recipients 
living or travelling in malaria endemic regions.

Malaria is one of the world׳s most widespread parasitic diseases. The parasitic
protozoans of the genus Plasmodium have developed resistance to several
antimalarial drugs. Some patients are therefore infected by two or more strains
with different levels of antimalarial drug sensitivity. We previously developed a
model to estimate the drug concentration (IC50) that inhibits 50% of the growth
of the parasite isolated from a patient infected with one strain. We propose here
a new Two-Slopes model for patients infected by two strains. This model involves 
four parameters: the proportion of each strain and their IC50, and the
sigmoidicity parameter. To estimate the parameters of this model, we have
developed a new algorithm called PGBO (Population Genetics-Based Optimizer). It
is based on the Metropolis-Hasting algorithm and is implemented in the
statistical software R. We performed a simulation study and defined three
evaluation criteria to evaluate its properties and compare it with three other
algorithms (Gauss-Newton, Levenberg-Marquardt, and a simulated annealing). We
also evaluated it using in vitro data and three ex vivo datasets from the French 
Malaria Reference Center. Our evaluation criteria in the simulation show that
PGBO gives good estimates of the parameters even if the concentration design is
poor. Moreover, our algorithm is less sensitive than Gauss-Newton algorithms to
initial values. Although parameter estimation is good, interpretation of the
results can be difficult if the proportion of the second strain is close to 0 or 
1. For these reasons, this approach cannot yet be implemented routinely.

Malaria is responsible for close to 1 million deaths each year, mostly among
African children. Red blood cells (RBCs) of children with severe malarial anemia 
show loss of complement regulatory proteins such as complement receptor 1 (CR1). 
We carried out this study to identify socio-economic, environmental, and
biological factors associated with the loss of RBC CR1. A cross-sectional study
was conducted in a malaria holoendemic area of western Kenya. Twelve
socioeconomic, environmental, and biological factors were examined for a
relationship with RBC CR1 level using bivariate linear regression followed by
creation of a multivariate linear regression model. A significant positive
relationship between RBC CR1 level and use of mosquito countermeasures was found.
However, there was no evidence of a significant relationship between RBC CR1
level and malaria infection or parasitemia level. Reducing mosquito exposure may 
aid in the prevention of severe malarial anemia by reducing the number of
infections and thus preserving RBC CR1.

BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis incidence in resource poor countries remains high. We
hypothesized that immune modulating co-infections such as helminths, malaria, and
HIV increase susceptibility to latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), thereby
contributing to maintaining the tuberculosis epidemic.
METHODS: Adults with sputum-positive tuberculosis (index cases) and their
eligible household contacts (HHCs) were recruited to a cohort study between May
2011 and January 2012. HHCs were investigated for helminths, malaria, and HIV at 
enrolment. HHCs were tested using the QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFN) assay at 
enrolment and six months later. Overnight whole blood culture supernatants from
baseline QFN assays were analyzed for cytokine responses using an 11-plex Luminex
assay. Associations between outcomes (LTBI or cytokine responses) and exposures
(co-infections and other risk factors) were examined using multivariable logistic
and linear regression models.
RESULTS: We enrolled 101 index cases and 291 HHCs. Among HHCs, baseline
prevalence of helminths was 9% (25/291), malaria 16% (47/291), HIV 6% (16/291),
and LTBI 65% (179/277). Adjusting for other risk factors and household
clustering, there was no association between LTBI and any co-infection at
baseline or at six months: adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval (CI);
p-value) at baseline for any helminth, 1.01 (0.39-2.66; 0.96); hookworm, 2.81
(0.56-14.14; 0.20); malaria, 1.06 (0.48-2.35; 0.87); HIV, 0.74 (0.22-2.47; 0.63).
HHCs with LTBI had elevated cytokine responses to tuberculosis antigens but
co-infections had little effect on cytokine responses. Exploring other risk
factors, Th1 cytokines among LTBI-positive HHCs with BCG scars were greatly
reduced compared to those without scars: (adjusted geometric mean ratio) IFNγ
0.20 (0.09-0.42), <0.0001; IL-2 0.34 (0.20-0.59), <0.0001; and TNFα 0.36
(0.16-0.79), 0.01.
CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence that co-infections increase the risk of LTBI,
or influence the cytokine response profile among those with LTBI. Prior BCG
exposure may reduce Th1 cytokine responses in LTBI.

Chloroquine was a cheap, extremely effective drug against Plasmodium falciparum
until resistance arose. One approach to reversing resistance is the inhibition of
chloroquine efflux from its site of action, the parasite digestive vacuole.
Chloroquine accumulation studies have traditionally relied on radiolabelled
chloroquine, which poses several challenges. There is a need for development of a
safe and biologically relevant substitute. We report here a
commercially-available green fluorescent chloroquine-BODIPY conjugate,
LynxTag-CQGREEN, as a proxy for chloroquine accumulation. This compound localized
to the digestive vacuole of the parasite as observed under confocal microscopy,
and inhibited growth of chloroquine-sensitive strain 3D7 more extensively than in
the resistant strains 7G8 and K1. Microplate reader measurements indicated
suppression of LynxTag-CQGREEN efflux after pretreatment of parasites with known 
reversal agents. Microsomes carrying either sensitive- or resistant-type PfCRT
were assayed for uptake; resistant-type PfCRT exhibited increased accumulation of
LynxTag-CQGREEN, which was suppressed by pretreatment with known
chemosensitizers. Eight laboratory strains and twelve clinical isolates were
sequenced for PfCRT and Pgh1 haplotypes previously reported to contribute to drug
resistance, and pfmdr1 copy number and chloroquine IC50s were determined. These
data were compared with LynxTag-CQGREEN uptake/fluorescence by multiple linear
regression to identify genetic correlates of uptake. Uptake of the compound
correlated with the logIC50 of chloroquine and, more weakly, a mutation in Pgh1, 
F1226Y.

In the present study, we performed a multivariate quantitative structure-activity
relationship (QSAR) analysis of 52 prodiginines with antimalarial activity.
Variable selection was based on the genetic algorithm (GA) and ordered predictor 
selection (OPS) approaches, and the models were built using the multiple linear
regression (MLR) and partial least squares (PLS) regression methods. The
leave-N-out crossvalidation and y-randomization tests showed that the models were
robust and free from chance correlation. The mechanistic interpretation of the
results was supported by earlier findings. In addition, the comparison of our
models with those previously described indicated that the OPS/PLS-based model had
a higher quality of external prediction. Thus, this study provides a
comprehensive approach to the evaluation of the antimalarial activity of
prodiginines, which may be used as a support tool in designing new therapeutic
agents for malaria.

malaria with neurological involvement.

BACKGROUND: Persistent neurocognitive impairments occur in a fifth of children
hospitalized with severe falciparum malaria. There is little data on the
association between different neurological phenotypes of severe malaria
(seizures, impaired consciousness and prostration) and impairments in executive
function.
METHODS: Executive functioning of children exposed to severe malaria with
different neurological phenotypes (N = 58) and in those unexposed (N = 56) was
examined using neuropsychological tests such as vigilance test, test for everyday
attention test for children (TEA-Ch), contingency naming test (CNT) and
self-ordered pointing test (SOPT). Linear regression was used to determine the
association between neurological phenotypes of severe malaria and executive
function performance scores, accounting for potential confounders.
RESULTS: Children with complex seizures in severe malaria performed more poorly
than unexposed controls in the vigilance (median efficiency scores (interquartile
range) = 4.84 (1.28-5.68) vs. 5.84 (4.71-6.42), P = 0.030) and SOPT (mean errors 
(standard deviation) = 29.50 (8.82) vs. 24.80 (6.50), P = 0.029) tests, but no
differences were observed in TEA-Ch and CNT tests. Performance scores for other
neurological phenotypes of severe malaria were similar with those of unexposed
controls. After accounting for potential confounders, such as child's age, sex,
schooling; maternal age, schooling and economic activity; perinatal factors and
history of seizures, complex seizures remained associated with efficiency scores 
in the vigilance test (beta coefficient (β) (95% confidence interval
(CI)) = -0.40 (-0.67, -0.13), P = 0.006) and everyday attention scores of the
TEA-Ch test (β (95% CI) = -0.57 (-1.04, -0.10), P = 0.019); the association with 
SOPT error scores was weak (β (95% CI) = 4.57 (-0.73-9.89), P = 0.089). Combined 
neurological phenotypes were not significantly associated with executive function
performance scores.
CONCLUSION: Executive function impairment in children with severe malaria is
associated with specific neurological phenotypes, particularly complex seizures. 
Effective prophylaxis and management of malaria-associated acute seizures may
improve executive functioning performance scores of children.

This study analyzed the financial contribution by the Global Fund to Fight
HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria and its relationship to eligibility criteria 
for funding in Latin America and the Caribbean in 2002-2010. Descriptive analysis
(linear regression) was conducted for the Global Fund financial contributions
according to eligibility criteria (income level, burden of disease, governmental 
co-investment). Financial contributions totaled US$ 705 million. Lower-income
countries received higher shares; there was no relationship between Global Fund
contributions and burden of disease. The Global Fund's international financing
complements governmental expenditure, with equity policies for financial
allocation.

BACKGROUND: Malaria continues to be a global health challenge, affecting more
than half the world's population and causing approximately 660,000 deaths
annually. The majority of malaria cases are caused by Plasmodium falciparum and
occur in sub-Saharan Africa. One of the major complications asscociated with
malaria is severe anaemia, caused by a cycle of haemoglobin digestion by the
parasite. Anaemia due to falciparum malaria in children has multifactorial
pathogenesis, which includes suppression of bone marrow activity. Recent studies 
have shown that haemozoin, which is a by-product of parasite haemoglobin
digestion, may play an important role in suppression of haemoglobin production,
leading to anaemia. In this study we correlated the levels of erythropoietin
(EPO), as an indicator of stimulation of haemoglobin production, to the levels of
monocyte acquired haemozoin in children with both severe and uncomplicated
malaria. There was a significantly negative correlation between levels of
haemozoin-containing monocytes and EPO, which may suggest that haemozoin
suppresses erythropoiesis in severe malaria. A multiple linear regression
analysis and simple bar was used to investigate associations between various
haematological parameters.
METHODS: To examine the levels of erythropoietin in the age categories, the
levels of erythropoietin was measured using a commercial Enyme-Linked
Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Giemsa-stained blood smears were used to determine
percentage pigment containing monocytes. The haemozoin containing monocytes was
expressed as a percentage of the total number of monocytes. To obtain the number 
of haemozoin containing monocytes/μL the percentage of haemozoin containing
monocytes was multiplied by the absolute number of monocytes/μL from the
automated haematology analyzer.
RESULTS: The levels of erythropoietin in younger children (<3 years) was
significantly higher than in older children with a similar degree of malaria
anaemia (Hb levels) (p < 0.005). Haemozoin-containing monocytes were relatively
higher in severe malaria anaemia patients compared to those with uncomplicated
malaria (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Age purportedly has a direct effect on background levels of
erythropoietin. With corresponding decreased levels of erythropoietin in older
children with the same degree of severe malarial anaemia, conceivably, the bone
marrows of younger children with acute malaria may be less sensitive to
erythropoietin.

BACKGROUND: Gametocytes are the transmission stages of Plasmodium parasites, the 
causative agents of malaria. As their density in the human host is typically low,
they are often undetected by conventional light microscopy. Furthermore,
application of RNA-based molecular detection methods for gametocyte detection
remains challenging in remote field settings. In the present study, a detailed
comparison of three methods, namely light microscopy, magnetic fractionation and 
reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for detection of Plasmodium
falciparum and Plasmodium vivax gametocytes was conducted.
METHODS: Peripheral blood samples from 70 children aged 0.5 to five years with
uncomplicated malaria who were treated with either artemether-lumefantrine or
artemisinin-naphthoquine were collected from two health facilities on the north
coast of Papua New Guinea. The samples were taken prior to treatment (day 0) and 
at pre-specified intervals during follow-up. Gametocytes were measured in each
sample by three methods: i) light microscopy (LM), ii) quantitative magnetic
fractionation (MF) and, iii) reverse transcriptase PCR (RTPCR). Data were
analysed using censored linear regression and Bland and Altman techniques.
RESULTS: MF and RTPCR were similarly sensitive and specific, and both were
superior to LM. Overall, there were approximately 20% gametocyte-positive samples
by LM, whereas gametocyte positivity by MF and RTPCR were both more than two-fold
this level. In the subset of samples collected prior to treatment, 29% of
children were positive by LM, and 85% were gametocyte positive by MF and RTPCR,
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study represents the first direct comparison of standard
LM, MF and RTPCR for gametocyte detection in field isolates. It provides strong
evidence that MF is superior to LM and can be used to detect gametocytaemic
patients under field conditions with similar sensitivity and specificity as
RTPCR.

SUMMARY Defining appropriate and objective endpoints for animal research can be
difficult. Previously we evaluated and implemented a body temperature (BT) of
<32 °C as an endpoint for experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) and were interested
in a similar endpoint for a model of severe malarial anaemia (SMA). Furthermore, 
we investigate the potential of a minimally invasive, non-contact infrared
thermometer for repeated BT measurement. ECM was induced with Plasmodium berghei 
ANKA infection in C57Bl/6 mice. SMA was induced with Plasmodium chabaudi AS
infection in A/J mice. Our previous published endpoint was applied in ECM and
30 °C was pre-determined as the lowest permitted limit for termination in SMA
according to consultation with the Danish Animal Inspectorate. Infrared
thermometer was compared with the rectal probe after cervical dislocation, ECM
and SMA. Linear regression analysis of rectal versus infrared thermometry:
cervical dislocation: Pearson R = 0·99, R 2 = 0·98, slope = 1·01,
y-intercept = 0·55; ECM: 0·99, 0·98, 1·06, -2·4; and SMA: 0·98, 0·97, 1·14, -5·6.
Implementation of the 30 °C endpoint captured all lethal infections. However,
some animals with BT below 30 °C were not deemed clinically moribund. This study 
supports repeated measurement infrared thermometry. A humane endpoint of 30 °C
was sensitive in capturing terminal animals but might overestimate lethality in
this SMA model.

BACKGROUND: According to WHO, 1.5 million cases of malaria are reported annually 
in Pakistan. Malaria distribution in Pakistan is heterogeneous, and some areas,
including Punjab, are considered at low risk for malaria. The aim of this study
is to describe the trend of imported malaria cases from Pakistan reported to the 
international surveillance systems from 2005 to 2012.
METHODS: Clinics reporting malaria cases acquired after a stay in Pakistan
between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2012, were identified from the
GeoSentinel (http://www.geosentinel.org) and EuroTravNet
(http://www.Eurotravnet.eu) networks. Demographic and travel-related information 
was retrieved from the database and further information such as areas of
destination within Pakistan was obtained directly from the reporting sites.
Standard linear regression models were used to assess the statistical
significance of the time trend.
RESULTS: From January 2005 to December 2012, a total of 63 cases of malaria
acquired in Pakistan were retrieved in six countries over three continents. A
statistically significant increasing trend in imported Plasmodium vivax malaria
cases acquired in Pakistan, particularly for those exposed in Punjab, was
observed over time (p = 0.006).
CONCLUSIONS: Our observation may herald a variation in malaria incidence in the
Punjab province of Pakistan. This is in contrast with the previously described
decreasing incidence of malaria in travelers to the Indian subcontinent, and with
reports that describe Punjab as a low risk area for malaria. Nevertheless, this
event is considered plausible by international organizations. This has potential 
implications for changes in chemoprophylaxis options and reinforces the need for 
increased surveillance, also considering the risk of introduction of
autochthonous P. vivax malaria in areas where competent vectors are present, such
as Europe.

Recalculating the net use gap: a multi-country comparison of ITN use versus ITN
access.

Use of insecticide treated nets is widely recognized as one of the main
interventions to prevent malaria and high use rates are a central goal of malaria
programs. The gap between household ownership of at least one ITN and population 
use of ITN has in the past been seen as evidence for failure to achieve
appropriate net use. However, past studies compared net use with ownership of at 
least one net, not access to sufficient nets within households. This study
recalculates the net use gap in recent large household surveys using the
comparison indicator of 'access to nets within the household' as now recommended 
by Roll Back Malaria and the World Health Organization. Data from 41 Demographic 
Health Surveys (DHS) and Malaria Indicator Surveys (MIS) (2005-2012) in
sub-Saharan Africa were used. For each dataset three indicators were calculated: 
population access to ITN, population use of ITN, and household ownership of at
least one ITN. The ITN use gap was expressed as the difference between one and
the ratio of use to access. The median proportion of users compared to those with
access was high, at 82.1%. Even at population access levels below 50%, a median
80.6% used an ITN given they had access, and this rate increased to 91.2% for
access rates above 50%. Linear regression of use against access showed that 89.0%
of household members with access to nets used them the night before. These
results clearly show that previous interpretations of the net use gap as a
failure of behavioral change communication interventions were not justified and
that the gap was instead primarily driven by lack of intra-household access. They
also demonstrate the usefulness of the newly recommended ITN indicators; access
to an ITN within the household provides a much more accurate comparison of ITN
use than ownership.

BACKGROUND: Advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) are newly identified
efficient oxidative stress biomarkers. In a longitudinal birth cohort the effects
were investigated of genetic polymorphisms in five oxidative pathway genes on
AOPP levels.
METHODS: This study is part of a three-arm randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled trial. Three hundred and twelve children were included in the 
present study with AOPP levels measured at 2.5, 5.5, 10.5, 15 and 24 months of
age. Twelve polymorphisms were genotyped in five oxidative stress pathway genes: 
glutathione reductase (GSR), glutamylcysteine synthetase (GCLC), glutathione
S-transferase (GST) P1, haem oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) and superoxide dismutase 2
(SOD2) in 298 children. There were 284 children assessed for anaemia and clinical
malaria infection at the age of 24 months.
RESULTS: Two principal components (PCA1 and PCA2) were derived from the AOPP
levels measured at the five time points. PCA1 was significantly associated with
anaemia (p = 0.0002), and PCA2 with clinical malaria infection (p = 0.047). In
the K-Means Cluster Analysis based on levels of AOPP, children were clustered
into two groups: Group A (lower AOPP levels) and Group B (higher AOPP levels).
The cluster membership was significantly associated with anaemia (p =0.003) as
well as with the GSR RS3594 polymorphism (p = 0.037). Mixed linear regression
analyses found that the single nucleotide polymorphisms GCLC RS10948751 and HMOX1
RS17885925 were significantly associated with AOPP levels (p = 0.030 and p =
0.027, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Plasma AOPP levels were predictive for anaemia and oxidative stress
markers for clinical malaria infection in two year old children. Several
polymorphisms in GCLC, GSR and HMOX1 genes were associated with oxidative stress 
status of these children.

BACKGROUND: Although artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs) are the recommended
first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria in most endemic countries, they
have been prohibitively expensive in the retail sector where many suspected
malaria cases purchase treatment. ACT subsidies seek to stimulate consumer demand
for the drugs over cheaper but often ineffective alternatives by reducing their
prices. Recent evidence from eight regions implementing such subsidies suggests
that they are generally successful in improving availability of the drugs and
decreasing their retail prices, but it remains unclear whether these outcomes
translate to improved use by patients with suspected malaria.
METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted to identify reports of
experimental or programmatic ACT subsidies to assess the impact of subsidies on
consumer use. Relationships between price, use and potential confounding factors 
were examined using logistic and repeated measures binomial regression models,
and approximate magnitudes of associations were assessed with linear regression. 
In total, 40 studies, 14 peer-reviewed and 26 non-peer-reviewed, were eligible
for inclusion in the analysis. The reviewed studies found a substantial increase 
in private sector ACT use following the introduction of a subsidy. Overall, each 
$1 decrease in price was linked to a 24 percentage point increase in the fraction
of suspected malaria cases purchasing ACTs (R(2) = 0.302). No significant
differences were evident in this relationship when comparing the poorest and
richest groups, rural vs urban populations or children vs adults.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that ACT price reductions can increase their 
use for suspected malaria, even within poorer, more remote populations that may
be most at risk of malaria mortality. Whether a subsidy is appropriate will
depend upon local context, including treatment-seeking behaviours and malaria
prevalence. This review provides an initial foundation for policymakers to make
evidence-based decisions regarding ACT price reductions to increase use of
potentially life-saving drugs.

Addressing the complex, multi-factorial causes of childhood anaemia is best done 
through integrated packages of interventions. We hypothesized that due to reduced
child vulnerability, a "buffering" of risk associated with known causes of
anaemia would be observed among children living in areas benefiting from a
community-based health and nutrition program intervention. Cross-sectional data
on the nutrition and health status of children 24-59 mo (N=2405) were obtained in
2000 and 2004 from program evaluation surveys in Ghana, Malawi and Tanzania.
Linear regression models estimated the association between haemoglobin and
immediate, underlying and basic causes of child anaemia and variation in this
association between years. Lower haemoglobin levels were observed in children
assessed in 2000 compared to 2004 (difference -3.30 g/L), children from Tanzania 
(-9.15 g/L) and Malawi (-2.96 g/L) compared to Ghana, and the youngest (24-35 mo)
compared to oldest age group (48-59 mo; -5.43 g/L). Children who were stunted,
malaria positive and recently ill also had lower haemoglobin, independent of age,
sex and other underlying and basic causes of anaemia. Despite ongoing morbidity, 
risk of lower haemoglobin decreased for children with malaria and recent illness,
suggesting decreased vulnerability to their anaemia-producing effects. Stunting
remained an independent and unbuffered risk factor. Reducing chronic
undernutrition is required in order to further reduce child vulnerability and
ensure maximum impact of anaemia control programs. Buffering the impact of child 
morbidity on haemoglobin levels, including malaria, may be achieved in certain
settings.

community from the eastern Smoky Hills of Kansas.

Nearly 30% of emerging infectious disease events are caused by vector-borne
pathogens with wildlife origins. Their transmission involves a complex interplay 
among pathogens, arthropod vectors, the environment and host species, and they
pose a risk for public health, livestock and wildlife species. Examining habitat 
associations of vector species known to transmit infectious diseases, and
quantifying spatio-temporal dynamics of mosquito vector communities is one aspect
of the holistic One Health approach that is necessary to develop effective
control measures. A survey was conducted from May to August, 2010 of the
abundance and diversity of mosquito species occurring in the mixed-grass prairie 
habitat of the Smoky Hills of Kansas. This region is an important breeding ground
for North America's grassland nesting birds and, as such, it could represent an
important habitat for the enzootic amplification cycle of avian malaria and
infectious encephalitides, as well as spill-over events to humans and livestock. 
A total of 11 species, belonging to the three genera Aedes, Anopheles, and Culex,
was collected during this study. Aedes nigromaculis, Ae. sollicitans, Ae.
taeniorhynchus, Culex salinarius, and Cx. tarsalis accounted for 98% of the
collected species. Multiple linear regression models suggested that mosquito
abundances in the grasslands of the central Great Plains were explained by
meteorological and environmental variables. Temporal dynamics in mosquito
abundances were well supported by models that included maximum and minimum
temperature indices (adjusted R(2) = 0.73). Spatial dynamics of mosquito
abundances were best explained by a model containing the following environmental 
variables (adjusted R(2) =0.37): ground curvature, topographic wetness index,
distance to woodland, and distance to road. The mosquito species we detected are 
known vectors for infectious encephalitides, including West Nile virus.
Understanding the microhabitat characteristics of these mosquito species in a
grassland ecosystem will aid in the control and management of these disease
vectors.

BACKGROUND: Intrapartum hypoxic events ("birth asphyxia") may result in
stillbirth, neonatal or postneonatal mortality, and impairment. Systematic
morbidity estimates for the burden of impairment outcomes are currently limited. 
Neonatal encephalopathy (NE) following an intrapartum hypoxic event is a strong
predictor of long-term impairment.
METHODS: Linear regression modeling was conducted on data identified through
systematic reviews to estimate NE incidence and time trends for 184 countries.
Meta-analyses were undertaken to estimate the risk of NE by sex of the newborn,
neonatal case fatality rate, and impairment risk. A compartmental model estimated
postneonatal survivors of NE, depending on access to care, and then the
proportion of survivors with impairment. Separate modeling for the Global Burden 
of Disease 2010 (GBD2010) study estimated disability adjusted life years (DALYs),
years of life with disability (YLDs), and years of life lost (YLLs) attributed to
intrapartum-related events.
RESULTS: In 2010, 1.15 million babies (uncertainty range: 0.89-1.60 million; 8.5 
cases per 1,000 live births) were estimated to have developed NE associated with 
intrapartum events, with 96% born in low- and middle-income countries, as
compared with 1.60 million in 1990 (11.7 cases per 1,000 live births). An
estimated 287,000 (181,000-440,000) neonates with NE died in 2010; 233,000
(163,000-342,000) survived with moderate or severe neurodevelopmental impairment;
and 181,000 (82,000-319,000) had mild impairment. In GBD2010, intrapartum-related
conditions comprised 50.2 million DALYs (2.4% of total) and 6.1 million YLDs.
CONCLUSION: Intrapartum-related conditions are a large global burden, mostly due 
to high mortality in low-income countries. Universal coverage of obstetric care
and neonatal resuscitation would prevent most of these deaths and disabilities.
Rates of impairment are highest in middle-income countries where neonatal
intensive care was more recently introduced, but quality may be poor. In settings
without neonatal intensive care, the impairment rate is low due to high
mortality, which is relevant for the scale-up of basic neonatal resuscitation.

BACKGROUND: Limited data exist on cotrimoxazole prophylactic treatment (CPT) in
pregnant women, including protection against malaria versus standard intermittent
preventive therapy with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPTp).
METHODS: Using observational data we examined the effect of CPT in HIV-infected
pregnant women on malaria during pregnancy, low birth weight and preterm birth
using proportional hazards, logistic, and log binomial regression, respectively. 
We used linear regression to assess effect of CPT on CD4 count.
RESULTS: Data from 468 CPT-exposed and 768 CPT-unexposed women were analyzed. CPT
was associated with protection against malaria versus IPTp (hazard ratio: 0.35,
95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.20, 0.60). After adjustment for time period this 
effect was not statistically significant (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.66, 95% CI:
0.28, 1.52). Among women receiving and not receiving CPT, rates of low birth
weight (7.1% versus 7.6%) and preterm birth (23.5% versus 23.6%) were similar.
CPT was associated with lower CD4 counts 24 weeks postpartum in women receiving
(-77.6 cells/ μ L, 95% CI: -125.2, -30.1) and not receiving antiretrovirals
(-33.7 cells/ μ L, 95% CI: -58.6, -8.8).
CONCLUSIONS: Compared to IPTp, CPT provided comparable protection against malaria
in HIV-infected pregnant women and against preterm birth or low birth weight.
Possible implications of CPT-associated lower CD4 postpartum warrant further
examination.

In the current era of malaria eradication, reducing transmission is critical.
Assessment of transmissibility requires tools that can accurately identify the
various developmental stages of the malaria parasite, particularly those required
for transmission (sexual stages). Here, we present a method for estimating
relative amounts of Plasmodium falciparum asexual and sexual stages from gene
expression measurements. These are modeled using constrained linear regression to
characterize stage-specific expression profiles within mixed-stage populations.
The resulting profiles were analyzed functionally by gene set enrichment analysis
(GSEA), confirming differentially active pathways such as increased mitochondrial
activity and lipid metabolism during sexual development. We validated model
predictions both from microarrays and from quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)
measurements, based on the expression of a small set of key transcriptional
markers. This sufficient marker set was identified by backward selection from the
whole genome as available from expression arrays, targeting one sentinel marker
per stage. The model as learned can be applied to any new microarray or qRT-PCR
transcriptional measurement. We illustrate its use in vitro in inferring changes 
in stage distribution following stress and drug treatment and in vivo in
identifying immature and mature sexual stage carriers within patient cohorts. We 
believe this approach will be a valuable resource for staging lab and field
samples alike and will have wide applicability in epidemiological studies of
malaria transmission.

A call to arms: on refining Plasmodium vivax microsatellite marker panels for
comparing global diversity.

University, 12 Waverly Place, New York, NY 10003, USA. suttop02@gmail.com.

BACKGROUND: Microsatellite (MS) markers have become an important tool for
studying the population diversity, evolutionary history and multiplicity of
infection (MOI) of malaria parasite infections. MS are typically selected on the 
basis of being highly polymorphic. However, it is known that the polymorphic
potential (mutability) of each marker can vary as much as two orders of
magnitude, which radically changes how diversity is represented in the genome
from one marker to the next. Over the past decade, approximately 240 Plasmodium
vivax MS have been published, comprising nine major panels of markers.
Inconsistent usage of each panel has resulted in a surfeit of descriptive genetic
diversity data that are largely incomparable between populations. The objective
of this study was to statistically evaluate the quality of individual MS markers 
in order to validate a refined panel of markers that will provide a balanced
picture of P. vivax population diversity.
METHODS: All previously published data, including genetic diversity indices, MS
parameters, and population parameters, were assembled from 18 different global
studies into a flat file to facilitate statistical analysis and modelling using
JMP® Genomics 6.0 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC, USA). Statistical modeling was
employed to down-select markers with extreme variation among the mean number of
alleles, expected heterozygosity, maximum repeat length and/or chromosomal
location of the repeat. Individual MS were analysed by step-down whole model
linear regression and standard least squares fit models, both stratified by
annual parasite incidence to identify MS markers with values significantly
different from the mean.
RESULTS: Of the 42 MS under evaluation in this study, 18 (nine high priority)
were identified as ideal candidates for measuring population diversity between
global regions, while five (two high priority) additional markers were identified
as candidates for MOI studies.
CONCLUSIONS: MS diversity was found to be a function of endemicity and motif
structure. Evaluation of individual MS permitted the assembly of a refined panel 
of markers that can be reliably utilized in the field to compare population
structures between global regions.

stability of human erythrocyte membrane and hematological and biochemical
variables.

This study evaluated the influence of infection by Plasmodium vivax on the
relations between hematological and biochemical variables and the osmotic
stability of the erythrocyte membrane in a Brazilian Amazon population. A total
of 72 patients with P. vivax malaria were included in the study and invited to
return after 14 days, post-treatment with chloroquine and primaquine, for
clinical and laboratorial reevaluations. The osmotic stability of the erythrocyte
membrane was analyzed by nonlinear regression of the dependency of the absorbance
of hemoglobin, released with hemolysis, as a function of the salt concentration, 
and it was represented by the inverse of the salt concentration at the midpoint
of the curve (1/H 50) and by the variation of salt concentration, which promotes 
lysis (dX). Bivariate and multivariate methods were used in the analysis of the
results. Prior to treatment of the disease, the erythrocytes showed greater
stability, probably due to the natural selection of young and also more stable
erythrocytes. The bivariate analysis showed that 1/H 50 was positively correlated
with red cell distribution width (RDW), urea, triglycerides, and very low-density
lipoprotein (VLDL)-cholesterol, but negatively associated with albumin,
HDL-cholesterol, and indirect bilirubin, while dX was negatively associated with 
the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration. These associations were confirmed 
by canonical correlation analysis. Stepwise multiple linear regression showed
that albumin, urea, triglycerides, and VLDL-cholesterol are the variables with
the highest abilities of predicting erythrocyte stability. The bivariate analysis
also showed that the hematological index RDW was related to elevated levels of
bilirubin and decreased levels of albumin and urea, associated with liver damage 
resulting from malaria.

BACKGROUND: Internet search query trends have been shown to correlate with
incidence trends for select infectious diseases and countries. Herein, the first 
use of Google search queries for malaria surveillance is investigated. The
research focuses on Thailand where real-time malaria surveillance is crucial as
malaria is re-emerging and developing resistance to pharmaceuticals in the
region.
METHODS: Official Thai malaria case data was acquired from the World Health
Organization (WHO) from 2005 to 2009. Using Google correlate, an openly available
online tool, and by surveying Thai physicians, search queries potentially related
to malaria prevalence were identified. Four linear regression models were built
from different sub-sets of malaria-related queries to be used in future
predictions. The models' accuracies were evaluated by their ability to predict
the malaria outbreak in 2009, their correlation with the entire available malaria
case data, and by Akaike information criterion (AIC).
RESULTS: Each model captured the bulk of the variability in officially reported
malaria incidence. Correlation in the validation set ranged from 0.75 to 0.92 and
AIC values ranged from 808 to 586 for the models. While models using
malaria-related and general health terms were successful, one model using only
microscopy-related terms obtained equally high correlations to malaria case data 
trends. The model built strictly of queries provided by Thai physicians was the
only one that consistently captured the well-documented second seasonal malaria
peak in Thailand.
CONCLUSIONS: Models built from Google search queries were able to adequately
estimate malaria activity trends in Thailand, from 2005-2010, according to
official malaria case counts reported by WHO. While presenting their own
limitations, these search queries may be valid real-time indicators of malaria
incidence in the population, as correlations were on par with those of related
studies for other infectious diseases. Additionally, this methodology provides a 
cost-effective description of malaria prevalence that can act as a complement to 
traditional public health surveillance. This and future studies will continue to 
identify ways to leverage web-based data to improve public health.

BACKGROUND: Despite progress in malaria control, malaria remains an important
public health concern in Cambodia, mostly linked to forested areas. Large-scale
vector control interventions in Cambodia are based on the free distribution of
long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs), targeting indoor- and late-biting malaria
vectors only. The present study evaluated the vector density, early biting
activity and malaria transmission of outdoor-biting malaria vectors in two
forested regions in Cambodia.
METHODS: In 2005 two entomological surveys were conducted in 12 villages and
their related forest plots in the east and west of Cambodia. Mosquitoes were
collected outdoors by human landing collections and subjected to enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect Plasmodium sporozoites after morphological 
identification. Blood samples were collected in the same villages for serological
analyses. Collected data were analysed by the classification and regression tree 
(CART) method and linear regression analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 11,826 anophelines were recorded landing in 787 man-night
collections. The majority (82.9%) were the known primary and secondary vectors.
Most of the variability in vector densities and early biting rates was explained 
by geographical factors, mainly at village level. Vector densities were similar
between forest and village sites. Based on ELISA results, 29% out of 17
Plasmodium-positive bites occurred before sleeping time, and 65% in the forest
plots. The entomological inoculation rates of survey 1 were important predictors 
of the respective seroconversion rates in survey 2, whereas the mosquito
densities were not.
DISCUSSION: In Cambodia, outdoor malaria transmission in villages and forest
plots is important. In this context, deforestation might result in lower
densities of the primary vectors, but also in higher densities of secondary
vectors invading deforested areas. Moreover, higher accessibility of the forest
could result in a higher man-vector contact. Therefore, additional vector control
measures should be developed to target outdoor- and early-biting vectors.

The study reports the QSAR rationales from multilateral approaches for the
antimalarial activities (against W2 and TM90-C2B strains of Plasmodium
falciparum) and physical properties (aqueous solubility, permeability and logD)
of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroacridin-9(10H)-one (THA) derivatives. A modification to
Free-Wilson matrix (parameter set) is introduced to improve the compound to
parameter ratio of the analysis carried out in the study. The models from
modified Free-Wilson and physicochemical parameters suggest that 5(th) (R1) and
8(th) (R4) positions of THA scaffold should be free from substitution for the
antimalarial activity against both the strains. The THA' s 6(th) (R2) and 7(th)
(R3) positions' substituents with a blend of hydrophobicity and polarity offer
scope to modulate the activities of these compounds. The substituent group
contributions derived here gives opportunity to examine various combinations
possible from these analogues. The models from the topological and other
structural indices has suggested that MLOGP, LP1 and JGI6 as three common
important features for activity against W2 and TM90 strains. The topological
indices participated in the models suggested a preference for longer path lengths
in molecules for better activity against both strains. The PLS analysis of the
descriptors identified in the feature selection approach, combinatorial protocol 
in multiple linear regression (CP-MLR), has suggested that MATS3e and nRORPh are 
best suited to modulate the W2 activity, and Me, T(S..F) and ARR are best suited 
to modulate the TM90 activity. In these derivatives the analysis of aqueous
solubility, permeability and logD has suggested that most of the R1 and R4
substituents have contributed with same arithmetic sign to theses properties. For
all other variations in these compounds, the permeability increased with
increasing logD and decreased with increasing aqueous solubility. The results
suggest ways for the activity-property modulation in these analogues.

We describe development of an absolute multiplex quantitative real-time PCR for
detection of Plasmodium spp., P. falciparum and P. vivax targets in order to
produce an assay amenable to high throughput but with reduced costs. Important
qPCR experimental details and information that is critical to performance and
reliability of assay results were investigated. Inhibition studies were performed
to test and compare co-purification of PCR inhibitors in samples extracted from
whole blood using either the manual or automated methods. To establish the most
optimal qPCR reaction volume, volume titration of the reaction master mix was
performed starting at 10 µl to 1 µl reaction master mix with 1 µl of template DNA
in each reaction. As the reaction volume decreased, qPCR assays became more
efficient with 1 µl reaction master mix being the most efficient. For more
accurate quantification of parasites in a sample, we developed plasmid DNAs for
all the three assay targets for absolute quantification. All of absolute qPCR
assays performed with efficiency of more than 94%, R(2) values greater than 0.99 
and the STDEV of each replicate was <0.167. Linear regression plots generated
from absolute qPCR assays were used to estimate the corresponding parasite
density from relative qPCR in terms of parasite/µl. One copy of plasmid DNA was
established to be equivalent to 0.1 parasite/µl for Plasmodium spp. assay, 0.281 
parasites for P. falciparum assay and 0.127 parasite/µl for P. vivax assay. This 
study demonstrates for the first time use of plasmid DNA in absolute
quantification of malaria parasite. The use of plasmid DNA standard in
quantification of malaria parasite will be critical as efforts are underway to
harmonize molecular assays used in diagnosis of malaria.

BACKGROUND: The epidemiological evidence linking socioeconomic deprivation with
adverse pregnancy outcomes has been conflicting mainly due to poor measurement of
socioeconomic status (SES). Studies have also failed to evaluate the plausible
pathways through which socioeconomic disadvantage impacts on pregnancy outcomes. 
We investigated the importance of maternal SES as determinant of birth weight and
gestational duration in an urban area and evaluated main causal pathways for the 
influence of SES.
METHODS: A population-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 559 mothers
accessing postnatal services at the four main health facilities in Cape Coast,
Ghana in 2011. Information on socioeconomic characteristics of the mothers was
collected in a structured questionnaire.
RESULTS: In multivariate linear regression adjusting for maternal age, parity and
gender of newborn, low SES resulted in 292 g (95% CI: 440-145) reduction in birth
weight. Important SES-related determinants were neighborhood poverty (221 g; 95% 
CI: 355-87), low education (187 g; 95% CI: 355-20), studentship during pregnancy 
(291 g; 95% CI: 506-76) and low income (147 g; 95% CI: 277-17). In causal pathway
analysis, malaria infection (6-20%), poor nutrition (2-51%) and indoor air
pollution (10-62%) mediated substantial proportions of the observed effects of
socioeconomic deprivation on birth weight. Generalized linear models adjusting
for confounders indicated a 218% (RR: 3.18; 95% CI: 1.41-7.21) risk increase of
LBW and 83% (RR: 1.83; 95% CI: 1.31-2.56) of PTB among low income mothers. Low
and middle SES was associated with 357% (RR: 4.57; 95% CI: 1.67-12.49) and 278%
(RR: 3.78; 95% CI: 1.39-10.27) increased risk of LBW respectively. Malaria
infection, poor nutrition and indoor air pollution respectively mediated 10-21%, 
16-44% and 31-52% of the observed effects of socioeconomic disadvantage on LBW
risk.
CONCLUSION: We provide evidence of the effects of socioeconomic deprivation,
substantially mediated by malaria infection, poor nutrition and indoor air
pollution, on pregnancy outcomes in a developing country setting.

BACKGROUND: Future progress in tackling malaria mortality will probably be
hampered by the development of resistance to drugs and insecticides and by the
contraction of aid budgets. Historically, control was often achieved without
malaria-specific interventions. Our aim was to assess whether socioeconomic
development can contribute to malaria control.
METHODS: We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess whether the risk 
of malaria in children aged 0-15 years is associated with socioeconomic status.
We searched Medline, Web of Science, Embase, the Cochrane Database of Systematic 
Reviews, the Campbell Library, the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, Health
Systems Evidence, and the Evidence for Policy and Practice Information and
Co-ordinating Centre evidence library for studies published in English between
Jan 1, 1980, and July 12, 2011, that measured socioeconomic status and
parasitologically confirmed malaria or clinical malaria in children. Unadjusted
and adjusted effect estimates were combined in fixed-effects and random-effects
meta-analyses, with a subgroup analysis for different measures of socioeconomic
status. We used funnel plots and Egger's linear regression to test for
publication bias.
FINDINGS: Of 4696 studies reviewed, 20 met the criteria for inclusion in the
qualitative analysis, and 15 of these reported the necessary data for inclusion
in the meta-analysis. The odds of malaria infection were higher in the poorest
children than in the least poor children (unadjusted odds ratio [OR] 1·66, 95% CI
1·35-2·05, p<0·001, I(2)=68%; adjusted OR 2·06, 1·42-2·97, p<0·001, I(2)=63%), an
effect that was consistent across subgroups.
INTERPRETATION: Although we would not recommend discontinuation of existing
malaria control efforts, we believe that increased investment in interventions to
support socioeconomic development is warranted, since such interventions could
prove highly effective and sustainable against malaria in the long term.

BACKGROUND: A challenge for systematic reviews on improving health worker
performance is that included studies often use different performance indicators, 
and the validity of comparing interventions with different indicators is unclear.
One potential solution is to adjust comparisons by indicator category, with
categories based on steps of the case-management process that can be easily
recognized (assessment of symptoms, treatment etc.) and that might require
different levels of effort to bring about improvements. However, this approach
would only be useful if intervention effect sizes varied by indicator category.
To explore this approach, studies were analyzed that evaluated the Integrated
Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) strategy.
METHODS: Performance indicators were grouped into four categories: patient
assessment, diagnosis, treatment and counseling. An effect size of IMCI was
calculated for each indicator. Linear regression modeling was used to test for
differences among the mean effect sizes of the indicator categories.
RESULTS: Six studies were included, with data from 3136 ill child consultations. 
Mean effect sizes for 63 assessment indicators, 12 diagnosis indicators, 31
treatment indicators and 34 counseling indicators were 50.9 percentage-points
(%-points), 44.7, 36.5 and 46.6%-points, respectively. After adjusting for
baseline indicator value, compared with the assessment mean effect size, the
diagnosis mean was 7.3%-points lower (P = 0.23), the treatment mean was
15.2%-points lower (P = 0.0004) and the counseling mean was 12.9%-points lower (P
= 0.0027).
CONCLUSION: Adjusting the results of systematic reviews for indicator category
and baseline indicator value might be useful for improving the validity of
intervention comparisons.

enzymes and human liver microsomes.

Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) is the recommended treatment of
uncomplicated P.falciparum malaria by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Some
artemisinin compounds and anti-retroviral drugs have been shown to be metabolized
by CYP2B6. In the African clinical settings, the likelihood of co-administration 
of ACTs and antiretroviral drugs is higher than elsewhere, posing the risk of
drug-drug interactions (DDIs). This study aimed to investigate whether
artemisinin compounds inhibit CYP2B6 activity in vitro using recombinant CYP2B6
(rCYP2B6) and human liver microsomes (HLM). Values for IC50 and Ki were
determined by kinetic analyses using non-linear regression. In vitro to in vivo
extrapolations of the likelihood of DDIs where done using a static [I]/Ki
approach. Artemisinin and artemether were shown to inhibit CYP2B6 in vitro
through a partial mixed type of inhibition, while dihydroartemisinin did not
inhibit the enzymatic activity. IC50 values for artemisinin were 9.5 and 9.1 µM
for rCYP2B6 and HLM, respectively, after 30 min of incubation. Corresponding
values for artemether were 7.5 and 5.4 µM. Artemisinin did not show any
time-dependency or requirement of NADPH in its mechanism, indicating a reversible
mode of inhibition. Based on the [I]/Ki approach using rCYP2B6, the risk of DDIs 
for artemisinin was indicated to be medium to high, while artemether had a low
risk. The findings indicate a potential but moderate risk of DDIs in the
co-administration of artemisinin or artemether with efavirenz in the co-treatment
of malaria and HIV/AIDS.

A longitudinal study on anaemia in children with Plasmodium falciparum infection 
in the Mount Cameroon region: prevalence, risk factors and perceptions by
caregivers.

Buea, P.O. Box 63, Buea, Cameroon. sumbelei@yahoo.co.uk

BACKGROUND: In heavily endemic malaria areas, it is almost inevitable that
malarial infection will be associated with anaemia, although malaria may not be
the prime cause of it. Anaemia is a major public health problem in Cameroon. We
hypothesized that, factors other than falciparum malaria account for anaemia in
the study area.
METHODS: A longitudinal study was conducted among 351 Plasmodium falciparum
positive children to determine the prevalence, risk factors and the perception of
anaemia by the caregivers in a semi-rural community. The investigative methods
included the use of a structured questionnaire, clinical evaluation and
laboratory investigations.
RESULTS: At enrolment the overall prevalence of anaemia as assessed by Hb
concentration (Hb < 11 g/dl) was 80.3% (282). Following treatment the prevalence 
of persistent anaemia was 6% and 46.2% of the children achieved haematological
recovery by day 42. Exploratory multiple linear regression analysis showed the
following; parasitaemia density (P < 0.01), enlarged spleen (P < 0.05), duration 
of fever > 2 days (P < 0.01), high white blood cell count (P < 0.001), sex (P <
0.05), iron status indicators (ferritin and transferrin) (P < 0.001), level of
education of the caregiver (P < 0.05), management of onset of malaria by
caregiver (P < 0.005) and wasting (P < 0.05) to be risk factors for anaemia in
children with falciparum infection. Approximately 75.5% (265) of the caregivers
had some knowledge about anaemia.
CONCLUSION: The identified risk factors revealed the important contributors to
the pathogenesis of anaemia in the Mount Cameroon region. Control efforts should 
therefore be directed towards proper health education emphasizing on proper
health seeking behaviour and attitudes of the population.

[Preparation of anti-malaria antibodies with a way of peptide-protein
conjugation].

[Article in Chinese]

Military Medical University, Shanghai 200003, China.

OBJECTIVE: To introduce a procedure of peptide-protein conjugation and prepare
anti-malaria antibodies using a peptide-protein conjugate.
METHODS: The recombinant atoxic form of Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A (rEPA) 
was used as carrier protein and modified by maleimide groups using the chemical
linker of Sulfo-EMCS. The number of the maleimide group added onto the protein
was measured by indirect Ellman's reaction. The maleimide modified protein was
used to titrate the Pfs48/45-158, a synthetic peptide including a short amino
acid sequence of Plasmodium falciparum Pfs48/45 with a cysteine residue at its
N-terminus, and the curve fitting of the titration data was performed using
linear regression. Based on the titration curve, the theoretic titration end
point was determined and the conjugation ratio of peptide to carrier protein
(mole peptide per mole carrier protein) was calculated. To scale up the
preparation of the peptide-protein conjugate of Pfs48/45-158-rEPA, the peptide
was used in excess to react with the modified carrier protein, and the resulting 
product was examined by SDS-PAGE. BALB/c mice were immunized with the
peptide-protein conjugates. The mouse immune sera were examined by ELISA and
immunofluorescence assay (IFA), two assays used respectively to determine the
antibody titers against the peptide and the ability of the sera to recognize
malaria parasites.
RESULTS: About 6.94 moles of maleimide groups were added onto one mole of rEPA
via the chemical linker used in the reaction. The peptide-protein conjugate of
Pfs48/45-158-rEPA was prepared with a conjugation ratio being about 7.33. High
antibody titers against the Pfs48/45-158 peptide (12 500 ELISA units) were
induced in mice immunized with the conjugates. The mouse immune sera were able to
recognize not only the peptide but also the malaria parasites.
CONCLUSION: Peptide-protein conjugation is a convenient way that can be used to
prepare anti-malaria antibodies. The indirect Ellman's reaction, titration and
SDS-PAGE used in the study form a set of quality control methods, which ensures
the quality and reproducibility of the conjugate.

An integrated linkage, chromosome, and genome map for the yellow fever mosquito
Aedes aegypti.

BACKGROUND: Aedes aegypti, the yellow fever mosquito, is an efficient vector of
arboviruses and a convenient model system for laboratory research. Extensive
linkage mapping of morphological and molecular markers localized a number of
quantitative trait loci (QTLs) related to the mosquito's ability to transmit
various pathogens. However, linking the QTLs to Ae. aegypti chromosomes and
genomic sequences has been challenging because of the poor quality of polytene
chromosomes and the highly fragmented genome assembly for this species.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Based on the approach developed in our previous
study, we constructed idiograms for mitotic chromosomes of Ae. aegypti based on
their banding patterns at early metaphase. These idiograms represent the first
cytogenetic map developed for mitotic chromosomes of Ae. aegypti. One hundred
bacterial artificial chromosome clones carrying major genetic markers were
hybridized to the chromosomes using fluorescent in situ hybridization. As a
result, QTLs related to the transmission of the filarioid nematode Brugia malayi,
the avian malaria parasite Plasmodium gallinaceum, and the dengue virus, as well 
as sex determination locus and 183 Mbp of genomic sequences were anchored to the 
exact positions on Ae. aegypti chromosomes. A linear regression analysis
demonstrated a good correlation between positions of the markers on the physical 
and linkage maps. As a result of the recombination rate variation along the
chromosomes, 12 QTLs on the linkage map were combined into five major clusters of
QTLs on the chromosome map.
CONCLUSION: This study developed an integrated linkage, chromosome, and genome
map-iMap-for the yellow fever mosquito. Our discovery of the localization of
multiple QTLs in a few major chromosome clusters suggests a possibility that the 
transmission of various pathogens is controlled by the same genomic loci. Thus,
the iMap will facilitate the identification of genomic determinants of traits
responsible for susceptibility or refractoriness of the mosquito to diverse
pathogens.

Experimental studies have indicated that low serum zinc levels affect immune
responses. However, few studies have evaluated the impact of serum zinc levels on
antibody responses in the field in developing countries. We investigated an
association between the anti-Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) antibody (immunoglobulin 
G) titer and serum zinc concentration among villagers in rural areas of the Lao
People's Democratic Republic. Blood samples were collected to detect Pf
infection. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure the
anti-PfIgG antibody titer. Each serum sample was assayed to measure the
concentration of zinc. Pearson's correlation coefficient was applied to the
association between zinc concentration and anti-PfIgG antibody titers. Multiple
linear regression analysis was used to assess the association between zinc
concentration and anti-PfIgG antibody titers, controlling for age and albumin
level. Of 71 blood samples, 40 were Pf positive and 31 were Pf negative. The
median serum zinc concentrations were 56.0 μg/dl in the Pf-positive group and
62.5 μg/dl in the Pf-negative group. The median anti-Pf titers were 833.4 in the 
positive group and 1237.2 in the negative group. Unexpectedly, there was a
negative correlation between serum zinc and anti-Pf IgG antibody titers; the
correlation coefficient were -0.453 and (p=0.003) in the positive group and
-0.461 (p=0.009) in the negative group. The results of this study indicated
sustained antibody responses among the villagers, who had likely been exposed to 
malaria periodically throughout their lives. Further studies are necessary to
determine the conditions in which zinc could be effective against malaria.

BACKGROUND: Pregnancy associated malaria is associated with decreased birth
weight, but in-utero evaluation of fetal growth alterations is rarely performed. 
The objective of this study was to investigate malaria induced changes in fetal
growth during the 3(rd) trimester using trans-abdominal ultrasound.
METHODS: An observational study of 876 pregnant women (398 primi- and
secundigravidae and 478 multigravidae) was conducted in Tanzania. Fetal growth
was monitored with ultrasound and screening for malaria was performed regularly. 
Birth weight and fetal weight were converted to z-scores, and fetal growth
evaluated as fetal weight gain from the 26th week of pregnancy.
RESULTS: Malaria infection only affected birth weight and fetal growth among
primi- and secundigravid women. Forty-eight of the 398 primi- and secundigravid
women had malaria during pregnancy causing a reduction in the newborns z-score of
-0.50 (95% CI: -0.86, -0.13, P = 0.008, multiple linear regression). Fifty-eight 
percent (28/48) of the primi- and secundigravidae had malaria in the first half
of pregnancy, but an effect on fetal growth was observed in the 3(rd) trimester
with an OR of 4.89 for the fetal growth rate belonging to the lowest 25% in the
population (95%CI: 2.03-11.79, P<0.001, multiple logistic regression). At an
individual level, among the primi- and secundigravidae, 27% experienced
alterations of fetal growth immediately after exposure but only for a short
interval, 27% only late in pregnancy, 16.2% persistently from exposure until the 
end of pregnancy, and 29.7% had no alterations of fetal growth.
CONCLUSIONS: The effect of malaria infections was observed during the 3(rd)
trimester, despite infections occurring much earlier in pregnancy, and different 
mechanisms might operate leading to different patterns of growth alterations.
This study highlights the need for protection against malaria throughout
pregnancy and the recognition that observed changes in fetal growth might be a
consequence of an infection much earlier in pregnancy.

Athens, Greece.

Malaria is among the most significant travel-related infections encountered by
travellers to endemic countries in terms of morbidity and mortality. The aim of
this study is to assess the knowledge and practices about malaria prophylaxis of 
travel medicine consultants in Greece. A standardized questionnaire was sent to
travel medicine consultants in all 57 Regional Departments of Public Health which
are the official travel medicine services in Greece. Seventy (66% response rate) 
travel medicine consultants participated in the survey. Of them, 34.3%, 17.1%,
and 44.3% delivered >20, 6-20, and ≤5 consultations per month, respectively. The 
average score of correct answers was 60% about malaria general knowledge and
prophylaxis, and 60% about case scenarios. Linear regression revealed that being 
a physician and previous training in travel medicine were factors statistically
significantly associated with higher rates of correct answers. Our results show
inadequacies in knowledge and practices on malaria prophylaxis of travel medicine

BACKGROUND: Primigravidity is one of the main risk factors for both malaria and
anaemia. Since the implementation of intermittent preventive treatment (IPTp) in 
sub-Saharan Africa, the relationship between anaemia and gravidity and its
evolution during pregnancy has been little explored. This study aimed to evaluate
the impact of gravidity on the variation of haemoglobin during pregnancy
according to the timing of gestation.
METHODS: Data from three studies carried out in nearby areas in south Benin
(Ouidah, Comé, Allada) between 2005 and 2012 were analysed. At inclusion (first
antenatal visit, ANV1) women's age, area of residence, schooling, gravidity,
gestational age, weight and height were recorded. Thick blood smears were
performed on ANV1, second visit (ANV2) and at delivery. In Allada, women's serum 
ferritin and CRP concentrations were also assessed. The impact of gravidity on
maternal haemoglobin (Hb) was analysed using a logistic or linear regression
depending on the outcome. The statistical significance was set to P < 0.05.
RESULTS: In total, data from 3,591 pregnant women were analysed. Both univariate 
and multivariate analyses showed a constant association between Hb concentrations
and gravidity in the three periods of Hb assessment (ANV1, ANV2 and delivery).
Mean Hb concentration was significantly lower in primigravidae than in
multigravidae at ANV1 (mean difference = -2.4 g/L, CI 95%: [-3.4, -1.4], P <
0.001). Afterwards, there was a significant increase in primigravidae only, with 
a tendency to reversal between primigravidae and multigravidae, which was
confirmed at delivery (mean difference = 2.8 g/L, CI 95%: [1.3, 4.2], P < 0.001).
The prevalence of malaria infection was halved between ANV1 and delivery in
primigravidae while it decreased by only 38% among multigravidae, who were less
prone to malaria infection (prevalence at ANV1, 20% and 10% respectively). Iron
deficiency was more common in multigravidae, and it decreased slightly in this
group between ANV1 and delivery.
CONCLUSION: In a context of IPTp, Hb levels improved progressively throughout
pregnancy in primigravidae, likely as a result of reduction in malaria infection.
In multigravidae, the improvement was less perceptible and anaemia was mainly due
to iron deficiency.

quality of drug prescriptions in Burkina Faso.

Quebec, Canada.

To improve access to health care services, an intervention was implemented in
Burkina Faso granting full exemption from user fees. Two further components,
staff training and supervision, were added to support the intervention. Our aim
in this study was to examine how this tripartite intervention affected the
quality of drug prescriptions. Using a mixed methodology, we first conducted an
interrupted time series over 24 months. Nine health centres were studied that had
previously undergone a process analysis. A total of 14 956 prescriptions for
children 0-4 years old were selected by interval sampling from the visit
registries from 1 year before to 1 year after the intervention's launch. We then 
interviewed 14 prescribers. We used three World Health Organization (WHO)
indicators to assess drug prescription quality. Analysis was carried out using
linear regression and logistic regression. The prescribers' statements underwent 
content analysis, to understand their perceptions and changes in their practice
since the subsidy's introduction. One effect of the intervention was a reduced
use of injections (odd ratio (OR) = 0.28 [0.17; 0.46]) in cases of acute lower
respiratory tract infections (ALRTI) without comorbidity. Another was a reduction
in the inappropriate use of antibiotics in malaria without comorbidity (OR = 0.48
[0.33; 0.70]). The average number of drugs prescribed also decreased (coefficient
= -0.14 [-0.20; -0.08]) in cases of ALRTI without comorbidity. The prescribers
reported that their practices were either maintained or improved. The user fees
exemption programme, combined with health staff training and supervision, did not
lead to any deterioration in the quality of drug prescriptions.

BACKGROUND: To control malaria, the Rwandan government and its partners
distributed insecticide-treated nets (ITN) and made artemisinin-based combination
therapy (ACT) widely available from 2005 onwards. The impact of these
interventions on malaria cases, admissions and deaths was assessed using data
from district hospitals and household surveys.
METHODS: District records of ITN and ACT distribution were reviewed. Malaria and 
non-malaria indictors in 30 district hospitals were ascertained from surveillance
records. Trends in cases, admissions and deaths for 2000 to 2010 were assessed by
segmented log-linear regression, adjusting the effect size for time trends during
the pre-intervention period, 2000-2005. Changes were estimated by comparing
trends in post-intervention (2006-2010) with that of pre-intervention (2000-2005)
period. All-cause deaths in children under-five in household surveys of 2005 and 
2010 were also reviewed to corroborate with the trends of deaths observed in
hospitals.
RESULTS: The proportion of the population potentially protected by ITN increased 
from nearly zero in 2005 to 38% in 2006, and 76% in 2010; no major health
facility stock-outs of ACT were recorded following their introduction in 2006. In
district hospitals, after falling during 2006-2008, confirmed malaria cases
increased in 2009 coinciding with decreased potential ITN coverage and declined
again in 2010 following an ITN distribution campaign. For all age groups, from
the pre-intervention period, microscopically confirmed cases declined by 72%,
(95% Confidence Interval [CI], 12-91%) in 2010, slide positivity rate declined
58%, (CI, 47%-68%), malaria inpatient cases declined 76% (CI, 49%-88%); and
malaria deaths declined 47% (CI, 47%-81%). In children below five years of age,
malaria inpatients decreased 82% (CI, 61%-92%) and malaria hospital deaths
decreased 77% (CI, 40%-91%). Concurrently, outpatient cases, admissions and
deaths due to non-malaria diseases in all age groups either increased or remained
unchanged. Rainfall and temperature remained favourable for malaria transmission.
The annual all-cause mortality in children under-five in household surveys
declined from 152 per 1,000 live births during 2001-2005, to 76 per 1,000 live
births in 2006-2010 (55% decline). The five-year cumulative number of all-cause
deaths in hospital declined 28% (8,051 to 5,801) during the same period.
CONCLUSIONS: A greater than 50% decline in confirmed malaria cases, admissions
and deaths at district hospitals in Rwanda since 2005 followed a marked increase 
in ITN coverage and use of ACT. The decline occurred among both children
under-five and in those five years and above, while hospital utilization
increased and suitable conditions for malaria transmission persisted. Declines in
malaria indicators in children under 5 years were more striking than in the older
age groups. The resurgence in cases associated with decreased ITN coverage in
2009 highlights the need for sustained high levels of anti-malarial interventions
in Rwanda and other malaria endemic countries.

QSAR, docking and ADMET studies of artemisinin derivatives for antimalarial
activity targeting plasmepsin II, a hemoglobin-degrading enzyme from P.
falciparum.

and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow, UP, India.

This work presents the development of quantitative structure activity
relationship (QSAR) model to predict the antimalarial activity of artemisinin
derivatives. The structures of the molecules are represented by chemical
descriptors that encode topological, geometric, and electronic structure
features. Screening through QSAR model suggested that compounds A24, A24a, A53,
A54, A62 and A64 possess significant antimalarial activity. Linear model is
developed by the multiple linear regression method to link structures to their
reported antimalarial activity. The correlation in terms of regression
coefficient (r(2)) was 0.90 and prediction accuracy of model in terms of cross
validation regression coefficient (rCV(2)) was 0.82. This study indicates that
chemical properties viz., atom count (all atoms), connectivity index (order 1,
standard), ring count (all rings), shape index (basic kappa, order 2), and
solvent accessibility surface area are well correlated with antimalarial
activity. The docking study showed high binding affinity of predicted active
compounds against antimalarial target Plasmepsins (Plm-II). Further studies for
oral bioavailability, ADMET and toxicity risk assessment suggest that compound
A24, A24a, A53, A54, A62 and A64 exhibits marked antimalarial activity comparable
to standard antimalarial drugs. Later one of the predicted active compound A64
was chemically synthesized, structure elucidated by NMR and in vivo tested in
multidrug resistant strain of Plasmodium yoelii nigeriensis infected mice. The
experimental results obtained agreed well with the predicted values.

In Uganda, as in many parts of Africa, the majority of the population seek
treatment for malaria in drug shops as their first point of care; however,
parasitological diagnosis is not usually offered in these outlets. Rapid
diagnostic tests (RDTs) for malaria have attracted interest in recent years as a 
tool to improve malaria diagnosis, since they have proved accurate and easy to
perform with minimal training. Although RDTs could feasibly be performed by drug 
shop vendors, it is not known how much customers would be willing to pay for an
RDT if offered in these settings. We conducted a contingent valuation survey
among drug shop customers in Mukono District, Uganda. Exit interviews were
undertaken with customers aged 15 years and above after leaving a drug shop
having purchased an antimalarial and/or paracetamol. The bidding game technique
was used to elicit the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for an RDT and a course of
artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) with and without RDT confirmation.
Factors associated with WTP were investigated using linear regression. The
geometric mean WTP for an RDT was US$0.53, US$1.82 for a course of ACT and
US$2.05 for a course of ACT after a positive RDT. Factors strongly associated
with a higher WTP for these commodities included having a higher socio-economic
status, no fever/malaria in the household in the past 2 weeks and if a malaria
diagnosis had been obtained from a qualified health worker prior to visiting the 
drug shop. The findings further suggest that the WTP for an RDT and a course of
ACT among drug shop customers is considerably lower than prevailing and estimated
end-user prices for these commodities. Increasing the uptake of ACTs in drug
shops and restricting the sale of ACTs to parasitologically confirmed malaria
will therefore require additional measures.

Innovation, Queensland University of Technology, Victoria Park Road, Kelvin
Grove, 4059, Brisbane, Australia.

BACKGROUND: Malaria is a significant threat to population health in the border
areas of Yunnan Province, China. How to accurately measure malaria transmission
is an important issue. This study aimed to examine the role of slide positivity
rates (SPR) in malaria transmission in Mengla County, Yunnan Province, China.
METHODS: Data on annual malaria cases, SPR and socio-economic factors for the
period of 1993 to 2008 were obtained from the Center for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) and the Bureau of Statistics, Mengla, China. Multiple linear
regression models were conducted to evaluate the relationship between
socio-ecologic factors and malaria incidence.
RESULTS: The results show that SPR was significantly positively associated with
the malaria incidence rates. The SPR (β = 1.244, p = 0.000) alone and combination
(SPR, β = 1.326, p < 0.001) with other predictors can explain about 85% and 95%
of variation in malaria transmission, respectively. Every 1% increase in SPR
corresponded to an increase of 1.76/100,000 in malaria incidence rates.
CONCLUSION: SPR is a strong predictor of malaria transmission, and can be used to
improve the planning and implementation of malaria elimination programmes in
Mengla and other similar locations. SPR might also be a useful indicator of
malaria early warning systems in China.

Complexity of a complex trait locus: HP, HPR, haemoglobin and cholesterol.

HP and HPR are related and contiguous genes in strong linkage disequilibrium
(LD), encoding haptoglobin and haptoglobin-related protein. These bind and
chaperone free Hb for recycling, protecting against oxidation. A copy number
variation (CNV) within HP (Hp1/Hp2) results in different possible haptoglobin
complexes which have differing properties. HPR rs2000999 (G/A), identified in
meta-GWAS, influences total cholesterol (TC) and LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C). We
examined the relationship between HP CNV, HPR rs2000999, Hb, red cell count
(RCC), LDL-C and TC in the British Women's Heart and Health Study (n=2779 for
samples having CNV, rs2000999, and phenotypes). Analysing single markers by
linear regression, rs2000999 was associated with LDL-C (β=0.040 mmol/L, p=0.023),
TC (β=-0.040 mmol/L, p=0.019), Hb (β=-0.044 g/dL, p=0.028) and borderline with
RCC (β=-0.032 × 10(12)/L, p=0.066). Analysis of CNV by linear regression revealed
an association with Hb (Hp1 vs Hp2, β=0.057 g/dL, p=0.004), RCC (β=0.045 ×
10(12)/L, p=0.014), and showed a trend with LDL-C and TC. There were 3 principal 
haplotypes (Hp1-G 36%; Hp2-G 45%; Hp2-A 18%). Haplotype comparisons showed that
LDL-C and TC associations were from rs2000999; Hb and RCC associations derived
largely from the CNV. Distinct genotype-phenotype effects are evident at the
genetic epidemiological level once LD has been analysed, perhaps reflecting
HP-HPR functional biology and evolutionary history. The derived Hp2 allele of the
HP gene has apparently been subject to malaria-driven positive selection.
Haptoglobin-related protein binds Hb and apolipoprotein-L, i.e. linking HPR to
the cholesterol system; and the HPR/apo-L complex is specifically trypanolytic.
Our analysis illustrates the complex interplay between functions and haplotypes
of adjacent genes, environmental context and natural selection, and offers
insights into potential use of haptoglobin or haptoglobin-related protein as
therapeutic agents.

The magnitude and trend of artemether-lumefantrine stock-outs at public health
facilities in Kenya.

Programme, PO Box 43640, 00100 GPO Nairobi, Kenya.

BACKGROUND: Health facility stock-outs of artemether-lumefantrine (AL), the
common first-line therapy for uncomplicated malaria across Africa, adversely
affect effective malaria case-management. They have been previously reported on
various scales in time and space, however the magnitude of the problem and trends
over time are less clear. Here, 2010-2011 data are reported from public
facilities in Kenya where alarming stock-outs were revealed in 2008.
METHODS: Data were collected between January 2010 and June 2011 as part of 18
monthly cross-sectional surveys undertaken at nationally representative samples
of public health facilities. The primary monitoring indicator was total stock-out
of all four weight-specific AL packs. The secondary indicators were stock-outs of
at least one AL pack and individual stock-outs for each AL pack. Monthly
proportions and summary means of the proportions over the monitoring period were 
measured for each indicator. Stock-out trends were assessed using linear
regression.
RESULTS: The number of surveyed facilities across 18 time points ranged between
162 and 176 facilities. The stock-out means of the proportion of health
facilities were 11.6% for total AL stock-out, 40.6% for stock-out of at least one
AL pack, and between 20.5% and 27.4% for stock-outs of individual AL packs.
Monthly decrease of the total AL stock-out was 0.005% (95% CI: -0.5 to +0.5; p = 
0.983). Monthly decrease in the stock-out of at least one AL pack was 0.7% (95%
CI: -1.5 to +0.3; p = 0.058) while stock-outs of individual AL packs decreased
monthly between 0.2% for AL 24-pack and 0.7% for AL six-pack without statistical 
significance for any of the weight-specific packs.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite lower levels of AL stock-outs compared to the reports in
2008, the stock-outs at Kenyan facilities during 2010-2011 are still substantial 
and of particular worry for the most detrimental:- simultaneous absence of any AL
pack. Only minor decrease was observed in the stock-outs of individual AL packs. 
Recently launched interventions to eliminate AL stock-outs in Kenya are fully
justified.

OBJECTIVE: To describe symptoms, physical examination findings, and set-point
viral load associated with acute HIV seroconversion in a heterosexual cohort of
HIV-discordant couples in Zambia.
DESIGN: We followed HIV serodiscordant couples in Lusaka, Zambia from 1995 to
2009 with HIV testing of negative partners and symptom inventories 3 monthly, and
physical examinations annually.
METHODS: We compared prevalence of self-reported or treated symptoms (malaria
syndrome, chronic diarrhea, asthenia, night sweats, and oral candidiasis) and
annual physical examination findings (unilateral or bilateral neck, axillary, or 
inguinal adenopathy; and dermatosis) in seroconverting vs. HIV-negative or
HIV-positive intervals, controlling for repeated observations, age, and sex. A
composite score comprised of significant symptoms and physical examination
findings predictive of seroconversion vs. HIV-negative intervals was constructed.
We modeled the relationship between number of symptoms and physical examination
findings at seroconversion and log set-point viral load using linear regression.
RESULTS: Two thousand, three hundred and eighty-eight HIV-negative partners were 
followed for a median of 18 months; 429 seroconversions occurred. Neither
symptoms nor physical examination findings were reported for most seroconverters.
Seroconversion was significantly associated with malaria syndrome among
nondiarrheic patients [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 4.0], night sweats (aOR =
1.4), and bilateral axillary (aOR = 1.6), inguinal (aOR = 2.2), and neck
(aOR = 2.2) adenopathy relative to HIV-negative intervals. Median number of
symptoms and findings was positively associated with set-point viral load
(P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Although most acute and early infections were asymptomatic, malaria
syndrome was more common and more severe during seroconversion. When present,
symptoms and physical examination findings were nonspecific and associated with
higher set-point viremia.

BACKGROUND: Visceral leishmaniasis is the world' second largest vector-borne
parasitic killer and a neglected tropical disease, prevalent in poor communities.
Long-lasting insecticidal nets (LNs) are a low cost proven vector intervention
method for malaria control; however, their effectiveness against visceral
leishmaniasis (VL) is unknown. This study quantified the effect of LNs on
exposure to the sand fly vector of VL in India and Nepal during a two year
community intervention trial.
METHODS: As part of a paired-cluster randomized controlled clinical trial in
VL-endemic regions of India and Nepal we tested the effect of LNs on sand fly
biting by measuring the antibody response of subjects to the saliva of Leishmania
donovani vector Phlebotomus argentipes and the sympatric (non-vector) Phlebotomus
papatasi. Fifteen to 20 individuals above 15 years of age from 26 VL endemic
clusters were asked to provide a blood sample at baseline, 12 and 24 months
post-intervention.
RESULTS: A total of 305 individuals were included in the study, 68 participants
provided two blood samples and 237 gave three samples. A random effect linear
regression model showed that cluster-wide distribution of LNs reduced exposure to
P. argentipes by 12% at 12 months (effect 0.88; 95% CI 0.83-0.94) and 9% at 24
months (effect 0.91; 95% CI 0.80-1.02) in the intervention group compared to
control adjusting for baseline values and pair. Similar results were obtained for
P. papatasi.
CONCLUSIONS: This trial provides evidence that LNs have a limited effect on sand 
fly exposure in VL endemic communities in India and Nepal and supports the use of
sand fly saliva antibodies as a marker to evaluate vector control interventions.

Areas where Plasmodium falciparum transmission is holoendemic are characterized
by high rates of pediatric severe malarial anemia (SMA) and associated mortality.
Although the etiology of SMA is complex and multifactorial, perturbations in
inflammatory mediator production play an important role in the pathogenic
process. As such, the current study focused on identification of inflammatory
biomarkers in children with malarial anemia. Febrile children (3 to 30 months of 
age) presenting at Siaya District Hospital in western Kenya underwent a complete 
clinical and hematological evaluation. Children with falciparum malaria and no
additional identifiable anemia-promoting coinfections were stratified into three 
groups: uncomplicated malaria (hemoglobin [Hb] levels of ≥11.0 g/dl; n = 31),
non-SMA (Hb levels of 6.0 to 10.9 g/dl; n = 37), and SMA (Hb levels of <6.0 g/dl;
n = 80). A Luminex hu25-plex array was used to determine potential biomarkers
(i.e., interleukin 1β [IL-1β], IL-1 receptor antagonist [IL-1Ra], IL-2, IL-2R,
IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-15, IL-17, tumor
necrosis factor alpha [TNF-α], alpha interferon [IFN-α], IFN-γ,
granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF], macrophage
inflammatory protein 1 alpha [MIP-1α], MIP-1β, IFN-inducible protein of 10 kDa
[IP-10], monokine induced by IFN-γ [MIG], eotaxin, RANTES, and monocyte
chemoattractant protein 1 [MCP-1]) in samples obtained prior to any treatment
interventions. To determine the strongest biomarkers of anemia, a parsimonious
set of predictor variables for Hb was generated by least-angle regression (LAR)
analysis, controlling for the confounding effects of age, gender,
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, and sickle cell trait,
followed by multiple linear regression analyses. IL-12p70 and IFN-γ emerged as
positive predictors of Hb, while IL-2R, IL-13, and eotaxin were negatively
associated with Hb. The results presented here demonstrate that the
IL-12p70/IFN-γ pathway represents a set of biomarkers that predicts elevated Hb
levels in children with falciparum malaria, while activation of the IL-13/eotaxin
pathway favors more profound anemia.

We performed a longitudinal study of adult survival of Anopheles darlingi, the
most important vector in the Amazon, in a malarigenous frontier zone of Brazil.
Survival rates were determined from both parous rates and multiparous
dissections. Anopheles darlingi human biting rates, daily survival rates and
expectation of life where higher in the dry season, as compared to the rainy
season, and were correlated with malaria incidence. The biting density of
mosquitoes that had survived long enough for completing at least one sporogonic
cycle was related with the number of malaria cases by linear regression. Survival
rates were the limiting factor explaining longitudinal variations in Plasmodium
vivax malaria incidence and the association between adult mosquito survival and
malaria was statistically significant by logistic regression (P<0.05). Survival
rates were better correlated with malaria incidence than adult mosquito biting
density. Mathematical modeling showed that P. falciparum and P. malariae were
more vulnerable to changes in mosquito survival rates because of longer
sporogonic cycle duration, as compared to P. vivax, which could account for the
low prevalence of the former parasites observed in the study area. Population
modeling also showed that the observed decreases in human biting rates in the wet
season could be entirely explained by decreases in survival rates, suggesting
that decreased breeding did not occur in the wet season, at the sites where adult
mosquitoes were collected. For the first time in the literature, multivariate
methods detected a statistically significant inverse relation (P<0.05) between
the number of rainy days per month and daily survival rates, suggesting that
rainfall may cause adult mortality.

BACKGROUND: Biomarkers of exposure to Plasmodium falciparum would be a useful
tool for the assessment of malaria burden and analysis of intervention and
epidemiological studies. Antibodies to pre-erythrocytic antigens represent
potential surrogates of exposure.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: In an outbreak cohort of U.S. Marines deployed to Liberia, 
we modeled pre- and post-deployment IgG against P. falciparum sporozoites by
immunofluorescence antibody test, and both IgG and IgM against the P. falciparum 
circumsporozoite protein by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay. Modeling
seroconversion thresholds by a fixed ratio, linear regression or nonlinear
regression produced sensitivity for identification of exposed U.S. Marines
between 58-70% and specificities between 87-97%, compared with malaria-naïve U.S.
volunteers. Exposure was predicted in 30-45% of the cohort.
CONCLUSION: Each of the three models tested has merits in different studies, but 
further development and validation in endemic populations is required. Overall,
these models provide support for an antibody-based surrogate marker of exposure
to malaria.

We examined the association between certain clinical factors and aflatoxin
B(1)-albumin adduct (AF-ALB) levels in HIV-positive people. Plasma samples
collected from 314 (155 HIV-positive and 159 HIV-negative) people were tested for
AF-ALB levels, viral load, CD4+ T-cell count, liver function profile, malaria
parasitaemia, and hepatitis B and C virus infections. HIV-positive participants
were divided into high and low groups based on their median AF-ALB of 0.93 pmol
mg(-1) albumin and multivariable logistic and linear regression methods used to
assess relationships between clinical conditions and AF-ALB levels. Multivariable
logistic regression showed statistically significant increased odds of having
higher HIV viral loads (OR=2.84; 95% CI=1.17-7.78) and higher direct bilirubin
levels (OR=5.47; 95% CI=1.03-22.85) among HIV-positive participants in the high
AF-ALB group. There were also higher levels of total bilirubin and lower levels
of albumin in association with high AF-ALB. Thus, aflatoxin exposure may
contribute to high viral loads and abnormal liver function in HIV-positive people
and so promote disease progression.

Questionnaire-based approach to assess schoolchildren's physical fitness and its 
potential role in exploring the putative impact of helminth and Plasmodium spp.
infections in Côte d'Ivoire.

BACKGROUND: Disability weights (DWs) are important for estimating burden of
disease in terms of disability-adjusted life years. The previous practice of
eliciting DWs by expert opinion has been challenged. More recent approaches
employed quality of life (QoL) questionnaires to establish patient-based DWs, but
results are ambiguous.
METHODS: In early 2010, we administered a questionnaire pertaining to physical
fitness to 200 schoolchildren in Côte d'Ivoire. Helminth and Plasmodium spp.
infections were determined and schoolchildren's physical fitness objectively
measured in a maximal multistage 20 m shuttle run test. Associations between
objectively measured and self-reported physical fitness and between self-reported
physical fitness and infection status were determined. Spearman rank correlation 
coefficient, uni- and multivariable linear regression models adjusting for
children's age and sex, ambient air temperature and humidity, Fisher's test, χ(2)
and t-test statistics were used for statistical analysis.
RESULTS: The prevalence of Schistosoma haematobium, Plasmodium spp., Schistosoma 
mansoni, hookworm and Ascaris lumbricoides in 167 children with complete
parasitological results was 84.4%, 74.9%, 54.5%, 14.4% and 1.2%, respectively.
High infection intensities and multiple species parasite infections were common. 
In the 137 children with complete data also from the shuttle run test, we found
statistically significant correlations between objectively measured and
self-reported physical fitness. However, no statistically significant correlation
between the children's parasitic infection status and self-reported physical
fitness was identified. An attrition analysis revealed considerably lower
self-reported physical fitness scores of parasitized children who were excluded
from shuttle run testing due to medical concerns in comparison to parasitized
children who were able to successfully complete the shuttle run test.
CONCLUSIONS: Our QoL questionnaire proofed valid to assess children's physical
fitness in the current study area. Reasons why no differences in self-reported
physical fitness in children with different parasitic infections were found are
manifold, but do not preclude the use of QoL questionnaires in the elicitation of
DWs. Indeed, the questionnaire was particularly useful in assessing physical
fitness of those children, who were - supposedly due to parasitic infections -
unable to complete the shuttle run test. Hence, we encourage others to use QoL
questionnaires to determine not only physical fitness, but also more subtle
morbidities.

GW, Sale RW, O'Neill SL.

BACKGROUND: New contained semi-field cages are being developed and used to test
novel vector control strategies of dengue and malaria vectors. We herein describe
a new Quarantine Insectary Level-2 (QIC-2) laboratory and field cages (James Cook
University Mosquito Research Facility Semi-Field System; MRF SFS) that are being 
used to measure the impact of the endosymbiont Wolbachia pipientis on populations
of Aedes aegypti in Cairns Australia.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The MRF consists of a single QIC-2
laboratory/insectary that connects through a central corridor to two identical
QIC-2 semi-field cages. The semi-field cages are constructed of two layers of
0.25 mm stainless steel wire mesh to prevent escape of mosquitoes and ingress of 
other insects. The cages are covered by an aluminum security mesh to prevent
penetration of the cages by branches and other missiles in the advent of a
tropical cyclone. Parts of the cage are protected from UV light and rainfall by
90% shade cloth and a vinyl cover. A wooden structure simulating the understory
of a Queenslander-style house is also situated at one end of each cage. The
remainder of the internal aspect of the cage is covered with mulch and potted
plants to emulate a typical yard. An air conditioning system comprised of two
external ACs that feed cooled, moistened air into the cage units. The air is
released from the central ceiling beam from a long cloth tube that disperses the 
airflow and also prevents mosquitoes from escaping the cage via the AC system.
Sensors located inside and outside the cage monitor ambient temperature and
relative humidity, with AC controlled to match ambient conditions. Data loggers
set in the cages and outside found a <2 °C temperature difference. Additional
security features include air curtains over exit doors, sticky traps to monitor
for escaping mosquitoes between layers of the mesh, a lockable vestibule leading 
from the connecting corridor to the cage and from inside to outside of the
insectary, and screened (0.25 mm mesh) drains within the insectary and the cage. 
A set of standard operating procedures (SOP) has been developed to ensure that
security is maintained and for enhanced surveillance for escaping mosquitoes on
the JCU campus where the MRF is located. A cohort of male and female Aedes
aegypti mosquitoes were released in the cage and sampled every 3-4 days to
determine daily survival within the cage; log linear regression from BG-sentinel 
trapping collections produced an estimated daily survival of 0.93 and 0.78 for
females and males, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The MRF SFS allows us to test novel control strategies 
within a secure, contained environment. The air-conditioning system maintains
conditions within the MRF cages comparable to outside ambient conditions. This
cage provides a realistic transitional platform between the laboratory and the
field in which to test novel control measures on quarantine level insects.

Climatic variables and malaria transmission dynamics in Jimma town, South West
Ethiopia.

BACKGROUND: In Ethiopia, malaria is seasonal and unstable, causing frequent
epidemics. It usually occurs at altitudes < 2,000 m above sea level.
Occasionally, transmission of malaria occurs in areas previously free of malaria,
including areas > 2,000 m above sea level. For transmission of malaria parasite, 
climatic factors are important determinants as well as non-climatic factors that 
can negate climatic influences. Indeed, there is a scarcity of information on the
correlation between climatic variability and malaria transmission risk in
Ethiopia in general and in the study area in particular. Therefore, the aim of
this study was to determine the level of correlation between meteorological
variables and malaria cases.
METHODS: Time-series analysis was conducted using data on monthly meteorological 
variables and monthly total malaria in Jimma town, south west Ethiopia, for the
period 2000-2009. All the data were entered and analyzed using SPSS-15 database
program. Spearman correlation and linear regression analysis were used to asses
association between the variables.
RESULTS: During last ten years (2000-2009), a fluctuating trend of malaria
transmission was observed with P.vivax becoming predominant species. Spearman
correlation analysis showed that monthly minimum temperature, total rainfall and 
two measures of relative humidity were positively related with malaria but
monthly maximum temperature negatively related. Also regression analysis
suggested that monthly minimum (p = 0.008), monthly maximum temperature (p =
0.013) and monthly total rainfall (p = 0.040), at one month lagged effect, were
significant meteorological factors for transmission of malaria in the study area.
CONCLUSION: Malaria incidences in the last decade seem to have a significant
association with meteorological variables. In future, prospective and
multidisciplinary cooperative research involving researchers from the fields of
parasitology, epidemiology, botany, agriculture and climatology is necessary to
identify the real effect of meteorological factors on vector- borne diseases like
malaria.

BACKGROUND: In Zanzibar, the Ministry of Health and partners accelerated malaria 
control from September 2003 onwards. The impact of the scale-up of
insecticide-treated nets (ITN), indoor-residual spraying (IRS) and
artemisinin-combination therapy (ACT) combined on malaria burden was assessed at 
six out of seven in-patient health facilities.
METHODS: Numbers of outpatient and inpatient cases and deaths were compared
between 2008 and the pre-intervention period 1999-2003. Reductions were estimated
by segmented log-linear regression, adjusting the effect size for time trends
during the pre-intervention period.
RESULTS: In 2008, for all age groups combined, malaria deaths had fallen by an
estimated 90% (95% confidence interval 55-98%)(p < 0.025), malaria in-patient
cases by 78% (48-90%), and parasitologically-confirmed malaria out-patient cases 
by 99.5% (92-99.9%). Anaemia in-patient cases decreased by 87% (57-96%); anaemia 
deaths and out-patient cases declined without reaching statistical significance
due to small numbers. Reductions were similar for children under-five and older
ages. Among under-fives, the proportion of all-cause deaths due to malaria fell
from 46% in 1999-2003 to 12% in 2008 (p < 0.01) and that for anaemia from 26% to 
4% (p < 0.01). Cases and deaths due to other causes fluctuated or increased over 
1999-2008, without consistent difference in the trend before and after 2003.
CONCLUSIONS: Scaling-up effective malaria interventions reduced malaria-related
burden at health facilities by over 75% within 5 years. In high-malaria settings,
intensified malaria control can substantially contribute to reaching the
Millennium Development Goal 4 target of reducing under-five mortality by
two-thirds between 1990 and 2015.

Uncertainties associated with quantifying climate change impacts on human health:
a case study for diarrhea.

Kolstad EW(1), Johansson KA.

Author information: 
(1)Uni Bjerknes Centre, Bergen, Norway. erikwkolstad@gmail.com

BACKGROUND: Climate change is expected to have large impacts on health at low
latitudes where droughts and malnutrition, diarrhea, and malaria are projected to
increase.
OBJECTIVES: The main objective of this study was to indicate a method to assess a
range of plausible health impacts of climate change while handling uncertainties 
in a unambiguous manner. We illustrate this method by quantifying the impacts of 
projected regional warming on diarrhea in this century.
METHODS: We combined a range of linear regression coefficients to compute
projections of future climate change-induced increases in diarrhea using the
results from five empirical studies and a 19-member climate model ensemble for
which future greenhouse gas emissions were prescribed. Six geographical regions
were analyzed.
RESULTS: The model ensemble projected temperature increases of up to 4°C over
land in the tropics and subtropics by the end of this century. The associated
mean projected increases of relative risk of diarrhea in the six study regions
were 8-11% (with SDs of 3-5%) by 2010-2039 and 22-29% (SDs of 9-12%) by
2070-2099.
CONCLUSIONS: Even our most conservative estimates indicate substantial impacts
from climate change on the incidence of diarrhea. Nevertheless, our main
conclusion is that large uncertainties are associated with future projections of 
diarrhea and climate change. We believe that these uncertainties can be
attributed primarily to the sparsity of empirical climate-health data. Our
results therefore highlight the need for empirical data in the cross section
between climate and human health.

Spatiotemporal change and ecological modelling of malaria in Turkey by means of
geographic information systems.

We described the spatiotemporal change of malaria (Plasmodium vivax) in Turkey
over 34 years (1975-2008), and assessed the role of environmental variables in
this change. We developed seven 5-year-period raster maps by using geo-referenced
malaria case data from the centres of 81 provinces and the kriging method with a 
spherical variogram model in a geographic information systems (GIS) model. We
also modelled malaria incidence in GIS by using our average malaria incidence
raster map, and complementary spatial database including the raster map layers of
14 environmental variables. We chose linear regression analysis with backward
method to investigate relationships among variables and develop a model. The
model was run in GIS to obtain a model incidence raster map. We tested the
reliability of the model map by residual statistics, and found the model map
dependable. Five-year-period maps revealed that the distribution of malaria cases
moved from the East Mediterranean region to the Southeast Anatolia region due to 
changing human activities. The latitude, minimum temperature, distance to seas
and elevation variables were found to have significant impacts on malaria.
Consequently, the model incidence map established a good background for early
warning systems to predict epidemics of malaria following environmental changes.

Antimalarial exposure delays Plasmodium falciparum intra-erythrocytic cycle and
drives drug transporter genes expression.

BACKGROUND: Multi-drug resistant Plasmodium falciparum is a major obstacle to
malaria control and is emerging as a complex phenomenon. Mechanisms of drug
evasion based on the intracellular extrusion of the drug and/or modification of
target proteins have been described. However, cellular mechanisms related with
metabolic activity have also been seen in eukaryotic systems, e.g. cancer cells. 
Recent observations suggest that such mechanism may occur in P. falciparum.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We therefore investigated the effect of
mefloquine exposure on the cell cycle of three P. falciparum clones (3D7, FCB,
W2) with different drug susceptibilities, while investigating in parallel the
expression of four genes coding for confirmed and putative drug transporters
(pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfmrp1 and pfmrp2). Mefloquine induced a previously not described
dose and clone dependent delay in the intra-erythrocytic cycle of the parasite.
Drug impact on cell cycle progression and gene expression was then merged using a
non-linear regression model to determine specific drug driven expression. This
revealed a mild, but significant, mefloquine driven gene induction up to 1.5
fold.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Both cell cycle delay and induced gene expression
represent potentially important mechanisms for parasites to escape the effect of 
the antimalarial drug.

Immunoglobulin GM 3 23 5,13,14 phenotype is strongly associated with IgG1
antibody responses to Plasmodium vivax vaccine candidate antigens PvMSP1-19 and
PvAMA-1.

Carolina, Charleston, SC 29425, USA. pandeyj@musc.edu

BACKGROUND: Humoral immune responses play a key role in the development of
immunity to malaria, but the host genetic factors that contribute to the
naturally occurring immune responses to malarial antigens are not completely
understood. The aim of the present investigation was to determine whether, in
subjects exposed to malaria, GM and KM allotypes--genetic markers of
immunoglobulin gamma and kappa-type light chains, respectively--contribute to the
magnitude of natural antibody responses to target antigens that are leading
vaccine candidates for protection against Plasmodium vivax.
METHODS: Sera from 210 adults, who had been exposed to malaria transmission in
the Brazilian Amazon endemic area, were allotyped for several GM and KM
determinants by a standard hemagglutination-inhibition method. IgG subclass
antibodies to P. vivax apical membrane antigen 1 (PvAMA-1) and merozoite surface 
protein 1 (PvMSP1-19) were determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
Multiple linear regression models and the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test were
used for data analyses.
RESULTS: IgG1 antibody levels to both PvMSP1-19 and PvAMA-1 antigens were
significantly higher (P = 0.004, P = 0.002, respectively) in subjects with the GM
3 23 5,13,14 phenotype than in those who lacked this phenotype.
CONCLUSIONS: Results presented here show that immunoglobulin GM allotypes
contribute to the natural antibody responses to P. vivax malaria antigens. These 
findings have important implications for the effectiveness of vaccines containing
PvAMA-1 or PvMSP1-19 antigens. They also shed light on the possible role of
malaria as one of the evolutionary selective forces that may have contributed to 
the maintenance of the extensive polymorphism at the GM loci.

This work reveals our efforts to continue identifying new active compounds
against neglected diseases, such as malaria and tuberculosis. We took several
3-arylquinoxaline-2-carbonitrile 1,4-di-N-oxide derivative activity results from 
the reference literature and established useful quantitative structure-activity
relationships. We hoped that the development of in silico models would broaden
our knowledge regarding the overwhelming problem of drug resistance to both
illnesses. The optimized molecular structures of 60 compounds were represented by
1497 DRAGON-type descriptors and subjected to linear regression analyses; the
quantitative structure-activity relationships resulted predictive when searching 
for new active compounds. We obtained a rational guide for the proposal of new
candidate structures whose activities still remain unknown.

Regulation of CCR5 expression in human placenta: insights from a study of
mother-to-child transmission of HIV in Malawi.

America. joubert.bonnie@epa.gov

BACKGROUND: Human promoter polymorphisms in the chemokine co-receptor 5 gene
(CCR5) have been noted for association with mother-to-child transmission of HIV
(HIV MTCT) as well as reduced receptor expression in vitro, but have not been
clearly associated with CCR5 expression in vivo. Placental expression of CCR5 may
be influenced by such polymorphisms as well as other in vivo regulatory factors.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We evaluated the associations between infant CCR5
polymorphisms, measures of maternal infection, and placental expression of CCR5
among mother-infant pairs in Blantyre, Malawi. RNA was extracted from placental
tissue and used in multiplex real-time PCR to quantify gene expression. Through
linear regression, we observed that CCR5-2554T (beta = -0.67, 95% CI = -1.23,
-0.11) and -2132T (beta = -0.75, 95% CI = -0.131, -0.18) were significantly
associated with reduced placental expression of CCR5. An incremental increase in 
CCR5 expression was observed for incremental increases in expression of two
heparan sulfate genes involved in viral infection, HS3ST3A1 (beta = 0.27, 95% CI 
= 0.18, 0.35) and HS3ST3B1 (beta = 0.11, 95% CI = 0.06, 0.18). Among HIV infected
mothers, an incremental increase in maternal HIV viral load was also associated
with higher CCR5 expression (beta = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.12, 1.39). Maternal HIV
status had no overall effect (beta = 0.072, 95% CI = -0.57, -0.72). Higher CCR5
expression was observed for mothers with malaria but was not statistically
significant (beta = 0.37, 95% CI = -0.43, 1.18).
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results provide in vivo evidence for genetic and 
environmental factors involved in the regulation of CCR5 expression in the
placenta. Our findings also suggest that the measurement of placental expression 
of CCR5 alone is not an adequate indicator of the risk of mother-to-child
transmission of HIV.

The certainty of the protective role of acquired immunity in malaria is the major
drive for malaria vaccine development. In this study, we measured the levels of
total IgG and IgG subclasses to four candidate malaria vaccine antigens;
MSP2-3D7, MSP2-FC27, AMA-1 and Pf332-C231, in plasma obtained from a cohort of
136 donors from Daraweesh in Sudan. The cohort was followed for malaria infection
for 9 years. After an initial analysis, the immune response to Pf332-C231 antigen
was the only one found associated with protection, thus taken for further
analysis. The number of previous clinical malaria episodes experienced by the
donors was used as an index for relative protection. The number of these episodes
was found to be negatively correlated with the levels of pre-existing total IgG, 
IgG2 and IgG3 to Pf332-C231 (correlation coefficient, CC - 0.215, p=0.012; CC -
0.195, p=0.023 and CC - 0.211, p=0.014, respectively), and also with age (CC -
0.311, p<0.001). Unexpectedly, equal levels of Pf332-C231 antibodies were induced
by both patent and sub-patent infections regardless of the number of previous
malaria episodes (1-7). Combining the correlation analysis with a multi-linear
regression, three variable markers for protection were emerged, two
age-dependent, the antibody response to Pf332-C231 and an unidentified marker
(likely immune response to other antigens), and the third was an age-independent 
unidentified marker (possibly gene polymorphisms). In conclusion, this report
suggests a protective effect for IgG subclasses to Pf332-C231 antigen against
malaria.

BACKGROUND: Artesunate plus sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine is one of the four
artemisinin-based combination therapies currently recommended by WHO as
first-line treatment for falciparum malaria. Sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine is also
used for intermittent preventive treatment for malaria in pregnancy. Drug use
patterns and drug pharmacokinetics are important factors impacting the spread of 
drug resistant parasites hence it is imperative to monitor the effect of
pharmacokinetic variability on therapeutic efficacy. Unfortunately, information
on the pharmacokinetics of sulphadoxine in children and pregnant women with
malaria is very limited. Methods for the assay of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine have
been previously reported, but they are not cost-effective and practicable in
analytical laboratories in low resource areas where malaria is endemic. Efforts
in this study were thus devoted to development and evaluation of a simple,
cost-effective and sensitive method for quantification of sulphadoxine in small
capillary samples of whole blood dried on filter paper.
METHODS: Sulphadoxine was determined in whole blood by reversed-phase high
performance liquid chromatography with UV detection at 340 nm. Sulisoxazole (SLX)
was used as internal standard. Chromatographic separation was achieved using a
Beckman Coulter ODS C18 and a mobile phase consisting of 0.05 M phosphate
buffer-methanol-acetonitrile (70:17:13 V/V/V) containing 1% triethylamine
solution.
RESULTS: Standard curves from sulphadoxine-spiked blood added to filter paper
were linear over the concentration range studied. Linear regression analysis
yielded correlation coefficient r2>0.99 (n=6). Extraction recoveries were about
82-85%. The limit of quantification was 120 ng/ml while the within and between
assay coefficient of variations were <10%. The inter-day precision was <5.8% and 
inter-day accuracy ranged from 4.1 to 5.3%. There was no interference from
endogenous compounds or any of the commonly used anti-malarial, analgesic and
anti-infective drugs with the peaks of SDX or the internal standard.
CONCLUSION: The recovery and accuracy of determination of SDX from whole blood
filter paper samples using the method described in this study is satisfactory,
thus making the method a valuable tool in epidemiological studies and therapeutic
drug monitoring in developing endemic countries. Furthermore, the applicability
of the method in studying the pharmacokinetic disposition of SDX in a patient
suggests that the method is suitable in malaria endemic areas.

Anopheles mosquito transmission of brain tumor.

Lehrer S(1).

Author information: 
(1)stevenlehrer@hotmail.com

Some investigators have postulated a viral cause of malignant glioma, possibly
SV40 [Miller G. Brain cancer. A viral link to glioblastoma? Science
2009;323(5910):30-1] or cytomegalovirus (CMV). A source of other brain tumor
viruses might be the anopheles mosquito, the vector of malaria. Evidence of an
association of anopheles with brain tumors can be found in the relationship
between malaria outbreaks in United States and reports of brain tumor incidence
by state. There is a significant association between US malaria outbreaks in 2004
and the reports of brain tumor incidence 2000-2004 from 19 US states (p<0.001).
Because increased numbers of both malaria cases and brain tumors could be due
solely to the fact that some states, such as New York, have much larger
populations than other states, such as North Dakota, multiple linear regression
was performed with number of brain tumors as the dependent variable, malaria and 
population as independent variables. The effect of malaria was significant
(p<0.001), and independent of the effect of population (p<0.001). Perhaps
anopheles transmits an obscure virus that initially causes only a mild transitory
illness but much later a brain tumor. If a mosquito-transmitted brain tumor virus
could be identified, development of a brain tumor vaccine might be possible.

The purpose of the present investigation was to characterize the partitioning of 
artemisinin and its derivatives into both non-parasitized as well as Plasmodium
falciparum parasitized red blood cells (RBCs). Artemisinin and selected
derivatives at concentrations of 3.55microM were incubated in RBCs with a
hematocrit of 33% for 2h at 37 degrees C, extracted from RBCs by solid phase
extraction, and analyzed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry in
positive electro-spray ionization mode with methanol as mobile phase. The uptake 
percent of artemisinin and selected derivatives into the non-parasitized RBCs
ranged between 35% and 45%, while that into parasitized RBCs was between 51% and 
72%. The results suggested that artemisinin and selected derivatives were
preferentially distributed in parasitized RBCs. A Multiple Linear Regression
model was built to gain insight about the essential structural properties
required for the uptake of this class of compounds in parasitized RBCs and will
provide instruction for designing of new derivatives of this class of compounds
with improved uptake.

longitudinal study.

Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 29755-7435, USA.

OBJECTIVES: To create a fetal size nomogram for use in sub-Saharan Africa and
compare the derived centiles with reference intervals from developed countries.
METHODS: Fetal biometric measurements were obtained at entry to antenatal care
(11-22 weeks' gestation) and thereafter at 4-week intervals from pregnant women
enrolled in a longitudinal ultrasound study in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of
Congo. The study population comprised 144 singleton gestations with
ultrasound-derived gestational age within 14 days of the menstrual estimate. A
total of 755 monthly ultrasound scans were included with a mean +/- SD of 5 +/- 1
(range, 2-8) scans per woman. Estimated fetal weight (EFW) was calculated at each
ultrasound examination using the Hadlock algorithm. A general mixed-effects
linear regression model that incorporated random effects for both the intercept
and slope was fitted to log-transformed EFW to account for both mean growth and
within-fetus variability in growth. Reference centiles (5(th), 10(th), 50(th),
90(th) and 95(th) centiles) were derived from this model.
RESULTS: Nomograms derived from developed populations consistently overestimated 
the 50(th) centile EFW value for Congolese fetuses by roughly 5-12%. Differences 
observed in the 10(th) and 90(th) centiles were inconsistent between nomograms,
but generally followed a pattern of overestimation that decreased with advancing 
gestational age.
CONCLUSIONS: In low-resource settings, endemic malaria and maternal nutritional
factors, including low prepregnancy weight and pregnancy weight gain, probably
lead to lower fetal weight and utilization of nomograms derived from developed
populations is not appropriate. This customized nomogram could provide more
applicable reference intervals for diagnosis of intrauterine growth restriction
in sub-Saharan African populations.

Multi-step polynomial regression method to model and forecast malaria incidence.

Chatterjee C(1), Sarkar RR.

Author information:

Malaria is one of the most severe problems faced by the world even today.
Understanding the causative factors such as age, sex, social factors,
environmental variability etc. as well as underlying transmission dynamics of the
disease is important for epidemiological research on malaria and its eradication.
Thus, development of suitable modeling approach and methodology, based on the
available data on the incidence of the disease and other related factors is of
utmost importance. In this study, we developed a simple non-linear regression
methodology in modeling and forecasting malaria incidence in Chennai city, India,
and predicted future disease incidence with high confidence level. We considered 
three types of data to develop the regression methodology: a longer time series
data of Slide Positivity Rates (SPR) of malaria; a smaller time series data
(deaths due to Plasmodium vivax) of one year; and spatial data (zonal
distribution of P. vivax deaths) for the city along with the climatic factors,
population and previous incidence of the disease. We performed variable selection
by simple correlation study, identification of the initial relationship between
variables through non-linear curve fitting and used multi-step methods for
induction of variables in the non-linear regression analysis along with applied
Gauss-Markov models, and ANOVA for testing the prediction, validity and
constructing the confidence intervals. The results execute the applicability of
our method for different types of data, the autoregressive nature of forecasting,
and show high prediction power for both SPR and P. vivax deaths, where the
one-lag SPR values plays an influential role and proves useful for better
prediction. Different climatic factors are identified as playing crucial role on 
shaping the disease curve. Further, disease incidence at zonal level and the
effect of causative factors on different zonal clusters indicate the pattern of
malaria prevalence in the city. The study also demonstrates that with excellent
models of climatic forecasts readily available, using this method one can predict
the disease incidence at long forecasting horizons, with high degree of
efficiency and based on such technique a useful early warning system can be
developed region wise or nation wise for disease prevention and control
activities.

London, United Kingdom.

BACKGROUND: Over a 16-year period, we conducted a clinical study of malaria
acquired worldwide in adults from malaria-nonendemic countries, to determine risk
factors for severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria.
METHODS: All patients with confirmed malaria who were managed by our unit from
1991 to 2006 were prospectively evaluated. Factors predicting disease severity
according to (1) strict World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, (2) a composite
measure of unfavorable outcome, and (3) length of hospital stay were identified
by logistic and linear regression analyses.
RESULTS: We evaluated 676 episodes of malaria, 482 (71%) due to P. falciparum and
194 (29%) due to nonfalciparum parasites. Black patients had a significantly
reduced risk of developing WHO-defined severe falciparum malaria, with Asian
patients having odds of severe falciparum malaria that were 8.05-fold (95%
confidence interval [CI], 2.93-22.1-fold) higher and white patients having odds
that were 8.20-fold (95% CI, 2.94-22.9-fold) higher. Black patients also had a
reduced risk of an unfavorable outcome and of a prolonged stay in the hospital,
compared with the risks for white or Asian patients. Of 6 patients with
falciparum malaria who died, none were black. In univariate analysis, patients
with parasitemias of >or= 2% had odds of severe falciparum malaria 12-fold higher
than those of patients with parasitemias of <2% (73% vs. 19%). Patients with a
history of previous clinical malaria, regardless of ethnicity, had a
significantly reduced risk of WHO-defined severe falciparum malaria (odds ratio, 
0.35 [95% CI, 0.15-0.80]).
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study demonstrate that ethnicity and
parasitemia are important independent risk factors for severe falciparum malaria 
in adults from malaria-nonendemic countries and that a history of previous
clinical malaria significantly reduces the risk of WHO-defined severe falciparum 
malaria.

Impact of insecticide-treated bednets (ITNs) on preventing malaria may be
minimized if they are not used by vulnerable populations. Among ITN-owning
households from 15 standardized national surveys from 2003 to 2006, we identify
factors associated with ITN use among children younger than 5 years of age and
make comparisons of ITN use among children and pregnant women across countries.
Within ITN-owning households, many children and pregnant women are still not
using them. Between-country analysis with linear regression showed child ITN use 
increases as intra-household access to ITNs increases (P = 0.020, R2 = 0.404),
after controlling for season and survey year. Results from within-country
logistic regression analyses were consistent with between-country analysis
showing intra-household access to ITNs is the strongest and most consistent
determinant of use among children. The gaps in ITN use and possession will likely
persist in the absence of achieving a ratio of no more than two people per ITN.

The CCTTT pentanucleotide microsatellite in iNOS promoter influences the clinical
outcome in P. falciparum infection.

To assess the hypothesis that nitric oxide (NO) is critical in the pathogenesis
of cerebral malaria, we analyzed those single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and
microsatellite (MS) of the promoter region of inducible nitric oxide synthase
(iNOS) gene which are known to enhance the NO production in vivo. A total of 428 
(204 severe, 224 mild) adult patients living in the eastern part of India were
analyzed. The single nucleotide substitutions -954G-->C was found to be very
rare, and -1173C-->T was absent in this population. But interestingly, longer
forms of MS were found to be significantly associated with severe malaria (OR =
2.89, 95% CI = 1.955-4.295, P < 0.0001), and the linear regression analysis
revealed that the risk of severe malaria significantly increases as the summed
repeat number in an individual increase (OR = 1.16, P = 0.0013). Further, the
median plasma level of nitrate/nitrite (NOx) was observed to be high in mild
patients compared to severe patients, and the level of parasitemia was
significantly low among mild patients than severe ones. These findings suggest
that the CCTTT repeats in iNOS may play a key role in the pathogenesis of severe 
malaria.

Information on malaria-associated anemia in adult patients is scarce in South
American populations. From 2004 to 2006, malaria patients 18 to 45 years of age
were recruited in a descriptive cross-sectional study from two different towns:
Manaus, in the Brazilian Amazon (120 patients) where Plasmodium falciparum
incidence is lower ( approximately 20%), and in Tumaco on the Colombian Pacific
Coast (126 patients) where P. falciparum incidence is higher ( approximately
90%). Relationships between hematologic parameters and independent variables were
explored using cross-tabulations and multiple linear regression analyses. We
found an inverse relationship of hemoglobin (Hb) levels with days of illness in
both sites. In Manaus but not in Tumaco, red cell distribution width (RDW) was
related to asexual parasitemia. Reticulocytes were higher in Plasmodium vivax
infection in Tumaco. Only in Tumaco, two patients with P. falciparum infection
presented with severe anemia (Hb < 7 g/dL). Etiologic factors associated with
hematologic changes in malaria seem to be multifactorial. More studies are needed
to clarify the anemia determinants in uncomplicated malaria in South America,
where malaria transmission is mostly unstable.

BACKGROUND: Anemia is the most frequent cytopenia in HIV-infected individuals and
is often associated with malaria.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of HIV-1 on the hematological recovery after a
clinical malaria episode.
METHODS: In Ndola, Zambia, a region with high malaria and HIV prevalence,
hemoglobin (Hb) was measured in 634 malaria patients 14 and 45 days after
antimalarial treatment. Risk factors for hematological recovery were analyzed in 
a multivariate linear regression model.
RESULTS: At enrollment, HIV-1-infected malaria patients had lower Hb compared
with HIV-1 uninfected (122.7 vs 136.0 g/L; P < 0.001). In both groups, mean Hb
was significantly lower at day 14 posttreatment than day 0 (P < 0.0001) and
significantly higher at day 45 than at day 14 (HIV-1 negative: P = 0.0001; HIV-1 
infected: P = 0.005). HIV-1 was a risk factor for a larger Hb decrease until day 
14 (P < 0.001) and slower recovery until day 45 (P = 0.048). When considering the
whole 45-day follow-up period, mean Hb increased in the HIV-1-negative group
(+3.54 g/L; 95% confidence interval: 1.37 to 5.70; P = 0.001) but not in the
HIV-1-infected group (-0.72 g/L; 95% confidence interval: -3.85 to +2.40; P =
0.64). HIV-1 infection as such (P < 0.0001), not CD4 cell count (P = 0.46), was
an independent risk factor for a slower hematological recovery.
CONCLUSIONS: HIV-1-infected malaria patients had a slower hematological recovery 
after successful parasite clearance. Malaria preventive measures should be
targeted to this high-risk group.

A country-wide malaria survey in Mozambique. I. Plasmodium falciparum infection
in children in different epidemiological settings.

(1)National Malaria Control Programme, Maputo, Mozambique. sjamabunda@gmail.com

BACKGROUND: Across tropical Africa the bulk of malaria-related morbidity and
mortality is particularly high during childhood. Classical malariometric surveys 
have relied on assessing malaria infection prevalence. The last comprehensive
evaluation of the malaria situation in Mozambique was carried out during the
1950s. This study aims to characterize the malaria transmission intensities and
to estimate the disease burden that may help guide control programme.
METHODS: Between February 2002 and April 2003, a house-to-house survey, was
carried out in 24 districts randomly selected. A total of 8,816 children aged
below 10 years old were enrolled. Finger prick and blood collection were
performed to prepare thick and thin films for malaria parasite species
identification, density and haemoglobin concentration. Axillary temperature was
also measured. Prevalence of infection, parasite density and anaemia were
estimated for age groups category in each region/stratum. Comparisons between
proportions were made using Chi-square test or Fisher exact. Relationship between
age groups, region/stratum and parasite prevalence, density was determined using 
linear regression. All survey mean estimations were adjusted for sampling
weights, clustering and stratification.
RESULTS: Malaria parasite prevalence was 58.9% (5.190/8.816), the majority of
blood smears 52.4% (4,616/8,816) were due to Plasmodium falciparum and geometric 
mean parasite density was 1,211 parasites/microl (95% CI, 1,141-1.286).
Gametocytes prevalence, only for P. falciparum was 5.6% (518/8,816). The burden
was highest in the northern regions and in the coastal stratum. Parasite
infection and geometric mean parasite density peaked during the second year of
life and thereafter decreased with increasing age. Mean haemoglobin
concentrations was 9.9 g/dl (95% CI 9.5-10.2). Anaemia prevalence was 69.8%
(6.257/8.816) and among anaemic children 11.5% (743/6.257) were severely anaemic.
Anaemia rose dramatically during the first year of life to peak among children in
the 12-23 months age group. Highest levels of anaemia were recorded in both
northern and central-northern regions 77.9% and 79.4% respectively.
CONCLUSION: This survey confirms that malaria especially that caused by P.
falciparum, remains endemic throughout the country. The burden of malaria disease
and anaemia-related malaria during childhood constitute a major public health
problem and warrant integrated and collaborative interventions towards its
control.

BACKGROUND: Intermittent preventive treatment with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine for
pregnant women (IPTp-SP) is currently being scaled up in many countries in
sub-Saharan Africa. Despite high antenatal clinic (ANC) attendance, coverage with
the required two doses of SP remains low. The study investigated whether a
targeted community-based promotion campaign to increase ANC attendance and SP
uptake could effectively improve pregnancy outcomes in the community.
METHODS: Between 2004 and 2006 twelve health centres in Boromo Health District,
Burkina Faso were involved in this study. Four were strategically assigned to
community promotion in addition to IPTp-SP (Intervention A) and eight were
randomly allocated to either IPTp-SP (Intervention B) or weekly chloroquine
(Control). Primi- and secundigravidae were enrolled at village level and thick
films and packed cell volume (PCV) taken at 32 weeks gestation and at delivery.
Placental smears were prepared and newborns weighed. Primary outcomes were
peripheral parasitaemia during pregnancy and at delivery, placental malaria,
maternal anaemia, mean and low birth weight. Secondary outcomes were the
proportion of women with > or = 3 ANC visits and > or = 2 doses of SP.
Intervention groups were compared using logistic and linear regression with
linearized variance estimations to correct for the cluster-randomized design.
RESULTS: SP uptake (> or = 2 doses) was higher with (Intervention A: 70%) than
without promotion (Intervention B: 49%) (OR 2.45 95%CI 1.25-4.82 p = 0.014).
Peripheral (33.3%) and placental (30.3%) parasite rates were significantly higher
in the control arm compared to Intervention B (peripheral: 20.1% OR 0.50 95%CI
0.37-0.69 p = 0.001; placental: 20.5% OR 0.59 95%CI 0.44-0.78 p = 0.002) but did 
not differ between Intervention A (17.4%; 18.1%) and Intervention B (20.1; 20.5%)
(peripheral: OR 0.84 95%CI 0.60-1.18 p = 0.280; placental: OR 0.86 95%CI
0.58-1.29 p = 0.430). Mean PCV and birth weight and prevalence of anaemia and low
birth weight did not differ between study arms.
CONCLUSION: The promotional campaign resulted in a major increase in
IPTp-coverage, with two thirds of women at delivery having received > or = 2 SP. 
Despite lower prevalence of malaria infection this did not translate into a
significant difference in maternal anaemia or birth weight. This data provides
evidence that, as with immunization programmes, extremely high coverage is
essential for effectiveness. This critical threshold of coverage needs to be
defined, possibly on a regional basis.

This article shows that the burden of certain tropical disease infections, after 
controlling for other factors, is positively correlated with HIV prevalence.
Using cross-national data and multivariate linear regression analysis, we
investigate the determinants of HIV prevalence in low- and middle-income
countries. We begin with social and economic variables used in other
cross-national studies and then incorporate data on parasitic and infectious
diseases endemic in poor populations, which are found to be strongly and
significantly correlated with--and are potent predictors of--HIV prevalence. The 
paper concludes by arguing that treating tropical diseases may be a
cost-effective add-on to HIV-prevention and -treatment programs, thus slowing the
spread of HIV in disease-burdened populations.

QSAR study on tetrahydroquinoline analogues as plasmodium protein
farnesyltransferase inhibitors: a comparison of rationales of malarial and
mammalian enzyme inhibitory activities for selectivity.

The quantitative structure-activity relationships of Plasmodium falciparum and
Rat protein farnesyltransferase (PFT) inhibitory activities of
6-cyano-1-(3-methyl-3H-imidazoly-4-ylmethyl)-3-substituted-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquin
oline (THQ) analogues are investigated in order to explore the
similarities/deviations between the two enzymes for these analogues. The
structure space of a ligand (BMS-214662) bound to Rat-PFT (PDB code 1SA5) has
been used as the conformational space of the compounds under investigation. The
study has been carried out using the combinatorial protocol in multiple linear
regression with several 2D- and 3D-descriptors from molecular operating
environment (MOE) representing the physicochemical and electronic features of the
compounds. The molecular potential energy and partially charged van der Waals
surface areas have taken part in the PFT models. They suggested in favor of
molecular arrangement with minimum energy and low positively/negatively charged
surfaces for optimum Pf-PFT inhibitory activity. Furthermore, less hydrophobic
compounds are preferred for the activity. The Rat-PFT inhibitory activity models 
suggested in favor of more negatively as well as more positively charged surface 
area descriptors for the better activity. The PLS analysis carried out on the
descriptors of the Pf-PFT and Rat-PFT models suggested that among the parameters,
the partially charged surface areas in the range -0.20 to -0.15 (PEOE_VSA-3) and 
-0.30 to -0.25 (PEOE_VSA-5), hydrophobicity (a_hyd, logP(o/w) and SlogP_VSA4),
and electronic energy (PM3_Eele) of the molecules hold promise for modulating the
Pf-PFT/R-PFT inhibitory activities of the compounds. This suggested the
possibility of modulating the Pf-PFT/R-PFT inhibitory activities and bringing
about selectivity in the THQ analogues for the malarial parasite enzyme.

Medicine, UK. sharon.cox@lshtm.ac.uk

OBJECTIVE: To retest our previous finding that the haptoglobin (Hp) 22 genotype
is associated with seasonal anaemia, and to investigate the role of malaria in
this effect.
METHODS: Haemoglobin (Hb) and peripheral parasitaemia were assessed at pre- and
post-malarial season cross-sectional surveys in rural Gambian children aged 10-72
months. Between the surveys, active longitudinal surveillance was conducted to
detect febrile episodes.
RESULTS: Unlike previously, no overall reduction in Hb was observed (Hb = 106.1
vs. 107.2 g/l, P = 0.13, n = 545). However, multi-variable linear regression
revealed differences in Hb over the season by Hp and Hb-sickle (HbS) genotype
(-2.20 g/l per copy of the Hp2 allele, P = 0.043; HbAS vs. HbAA + 3.13 g/l, P =
0.11, n = 536). There was no effect of malarial episodes during follow-up; this
suggests that when effective treatment is given, Hb levels recover. The A61-C Hp 
promoter SNP, associated with the Hp2 allele, had no effect.
CONCLUSION: The effect of the Hp2 allele appears to be independent of effects on 
malaria incidence but may affect Hb levels through increased oxidant stress and
red cell turnover. This may be supported by our previous observations that the
effect of Hp22 was independent of markers of iron status and zinc protoporphyrin 
measured at the cross-sectional surveys and therefore also of iron availability
for erythropoiesis.

Water quality of aquatic habitats is an important determinant of female mosquito 
oviposition and successful larval development. This study examined the influence 
of environmental covariates on Anopheles arabiensis mosquito abundance in the
Mwea Irrigation Scheme, Central Province of Kenya, prior to implementation of a
malaria vector control program. Experimental rice plots were used to examine the 
environmental covariates responsible for regulating abundance and diversity of
the aquatic stages of malaria vectors. Mosquito larval sampling and water quality
analysis were done weekly from the flooding stage to the rice maturation stage.
Sampling for mosquito larvae was conducted using standard dipping technique.
During each larval collection, environmental covariates such as pH, temperature, 
conductivity, salinity, dissolved oxygen, water depth, and rice stage were
measured. Anopheles arabiensis larval density was highest between 1 wk before
transplanting and 4 wk after transplanting with peaks at weeks 0, 3, and 8. The
fluctuation in values of the various environmental covariates showed
characteristic patterns in different rice growth phases depending on the changes 
taking place due to the agronomic practices. Using a backward linear regression
model, the factors that were found to be associated with abundance of An.
arabiensis larvae at any of the rice growing phases included the following:
dissolved oxygen, pH, turbidity, water depth, rice height, number of rice
tillers, salinity, conductivity, and temperature. The environmental covariates
associated with abundance of An. arabiensis were associated with early vegetative
stage of the rice growth. For effective control of developmental stages of
mosquito larvae, the application of larvicides should be done at the vegetative
stage and the larvicides should persist until the beginning of the reproductive
stage of the rice.

BACKGROUND: Individuals living in malaria endemic areas generally harbour
multiple parasite strains. Multiplicity of infection (MOI) can be an indicator of
immune status. However, whether this is good or bad for the development of
immunity to malaria, is still a matter of debate. This study aimed to examine the
MOI in asymptomatic children between two and ten years of age and to relate it to
erythrocyte variants, clinical attacks, transmission levels and other
parasitological indexes.
METHODS: Study took place in Niakhar area in Senegal, where malaria is
mesoendemic and seasonal. Three hundred and seventy two asymptomatic children
were included. Sickle-cell trait, G6PD deficiency (A- and Santamaria) and
alpha+-thalassaemia (-alpha3.7 type) were determined using PCR. Multiplicity of
Plasmodium falciparum infection, i.e. number of concurrent clones, was defined by
PCR-based genotyping of the merozoite surface protein-2 (msp2), before and at the
end of the malaria transmission season. The chi2-test, ANOVA, multivariate linear
regression and logistic regression statistical tests were used for data analysis.
RESULTS: MOI was significantly higher at the end of transmission season. The
majority of PCR positive subjects had multiple infections at both time points
(64% before and 87% after the transmission season). MOI did not increase in
alpha-thalassaemic and G6PD mutated children. The ABO system and HbAS did not
affect MOI at any time points. No association between MOI and clinical attack was
observed. MOI did not vary over age at any time points. There was a significant
correlation between MOI and parasite density, as the higher parasite counts
increases the probability of having multiple infections.
CONCLUSION: Taken together our data revealed that alpha-thalassaemia may have a
role in protection against certain parasite strains. The protection against the
increase in MOI after the transmission season conferred by G6PD deficiency is
probably due to clearance of the malaria parasite at early stages of infection.
The ABO system and HbAS are involved in the severity of the disease but do not
affect asymptomatic infections. MOI was not age-dependent, in the range of two to
ten years, but was correlated with parasite density. However some of these
observations need to be confirmed including larger sample size with broader age
range and using other msp2 genotyping method.

BACKGROUND: Malaria is a leading cause of death in children below five years of
age in sub-Saharan Africa. All-cause and malaria-specific mortality rates for
children under-five years old in a mesoendemic malaria area (The Gambia) were
compared with those from a hyper/holoendemic area (Burkina Faso).
METHODS: Information on observed person-years (PY), deaths and cause of death was
extracted from online search, using key words: "Africa, The Gambia, Burkina Faso,
malaria, Plasmodium falciparum, mortality, child survival, morbidity". Missing
person-years were estimated and all-cause and malaria-specific mortality were
calculated as rates per 1,000 PY. Studies were classified as
longitudinal/clinical studies or surveys/censuses. Linear regression was used to 
investigate mortality trends.
RESULTS: Overall, 39 and 18 longitudinal/clinical studies plus 10 and 15 surveys 
and censuses were identified for The Gambia and Burkina Faso respectively
(1960-2004). Model-based estimates for under-five all-cause mortality rates show 
a decline from 1960 to 2000 in both countries (Burkina Faso: from 71.8 to 39.0), 
but more markedly in The Gambia (from 104.5 to 28.4). The weighted-average
malaria-specific mortality rate per 1000 person-years for Burkina Faso (15.4, 95%
CI: 13.0-18.3) was higher than that in The Gambia (9.5, 95% CI: 9.1-10.1).
Malaria mortality rates did not decline over time in either country.
CONCLUSION: Child mortality in both countries declined significantly in the
period 1960 to 2004, possibly due to socio-economic development, improved health 
services and specific intervention projects. However, there was little decline in
malaria mortality suggesting that there had been no major impact of malaria
control programmes during this period. The difference in malaria mortality rates 
across countries points to significant differences in national disease control
policies and/or disease transmission patterns.

Fever as a cause of hypophosphatemia in patients with malaria.

Browner W(1), Haber R.

Author information: 
(1)California Pacific Medical Center, San Francisco, California, United States of
America.

Hypophosphatemia occurs in 40 to 60% of patients with acute malaria, and in many 
other conditions associated with elevations of body temperature. To determine the
prevalence and causes of hypophosphatemia in patients with malaria, we
retrospectively studied all adults diagnosed with acute malaria during a 12-year 
period. To validate our findings, we analyzed a second sample of malaria patients
during a subsequent 10-year period. Serum phosphorus correlated inversely with
temperature (n = 59, r = -0.62; P<0.0001), such that each 1 degrees C increase in
body temperature was associated with a reduction of 0.18 mmol/L (0.56 mg/dL) in
the serum phosphorus level (95% confidence interval: -0.12 to -0.24 mmol/L [-0.37
to -0.74 mg/dL] per 1 degrees C). A similar effect was observed among 19 patients
who had repeat measurements of serum phosphorus and temperature. In a multiple
linear regression analysis, the relation between temperature and serum phosphorus
level was independent of blood pH, PCO2, and serum levels of potassium,
bicarbonate, calcium, albumin, and glucose. Our study demonstrates a strong
inverse linear relation between body temperature and serum phosphorus level that 
was not explained by other factors known to cause hypophosphatemia. If causal,
this association can account for the high prevalence of hypophosphatemia,
observed in our patients and in previous studies of patients with malaria.
Because hypophosphatemia has been observed in other clinical conditions
characterized by fever or hyperthermia, this relation may not be unique to
malaria. Elevation of body temperature should be added to the list of causes of
hypophosphatemia.

Motor activity improves cognitive and social-emotional development through a
child's exploration of his or her physical and social environment. This study
assessed anemia, iron deficiency, hemoglobin (Hb), length-for-age Z-score (LAZ), 
and malaria infection as predictors of motor activity in 771 children aged 5-19
mo. Trained observers conducted 2- to 4-h observations of children's motor
activity in and around their homes. Binary logistic regression assessed the
predictors of any locomotion. Children who did not locomote during the
observation (nonmovers) were excluded from further analyses. Linear regression
evaluated the predictors of total motor activity (TMA) and time spent in
locomotion for all children who locomoted during the observation combined
(movers) and then separately for crawlers and walkers. Iron deficiency (77.0%),
anemia (58.9%), malaria infection (33.9%), and stunting (34.6%) were prevalent.
Iron deficiency with and without anemia, Hb, LAZ, and malaria infection
significantly predicted TMA and locomotion in all movers. Malaria infection
significantly predicted less TMA and locomotion in crawlers. In walkers, iron
deficiency anemia predicted less activity and locomotion, whereas higher Hb and
LAZ significantly predicted more activity and locomotion, even after controlling 
for attained milestone. Improvements in iron status and growth and prevention or 
effective treatment of malaria may improve children's motor, cognitive, and
social-emotional development either directly or through improvements in motor
activity. However, the relative importance of these factors is dependent on motor
development, with malaria being important for the younger, less developmentally
advanced children and Hb and LAZ becoming important as children begin to attain
walking skills.

OBJECTIVES: To determine mathematical correlations of three quantitative
techniques to measure plasma cholinesterase, using reference values already
established for two populations in the department of Antioquia, Colombia.
METHODS: In this descriptive, cross-sectional, prospective study, two
independent, representative samples of working adults (18 to 65 years old) were
examined. In both samples the adults worked for businesses associated with
Colombia's Social Security system. Adults in the two samples had not been exposed
to cholinesterase-inhibiting pesticides. The samples were from two neighboring
regions of the department of Antioquia: one sample (415 adults) was from the
Aburrá Valley, and the other (412 adults) was from Oriente Antioqueño (Eastern
Antioquia). Plasma cholinesterase (EC 3.1.1.8) was measured using three
quantitative methods: Michel, EQM, and Monotest. Linear regression equations were
developed to correlate results of these three techniques.
RESULTS: Six simple linear regression equations were defined to show the
relationship of three measurement techniques for plasma cholinesterase. There was
a moderate correlation of the three techniques (r = 0.686 to 0.771), but it
increased (r = 0.744 to 0.811) when 12 (1.5%) outliers were eliminated.
Associations among the three techniques were highly significant (P < 0.001). The 
adjusted equations for Y = a + bX are: EQM (U/mL) = 0.40773 + 1.8757 (Michel
[delta pH/h]); Michel (delta pH/h) = 0.25799 + 0.33871 (EQM [U/mL]); Monotest
(U/L) = 462.0 + 4 565.0 (Michel [delta pH/h]); Michel (delta pH/h) = 0.42956 +
0.00012125 (Monotest [U/L]); EQM (U/mL) = 0.75333 + 0.00031056 (Monotest [U/L]); 
and Monotest (U/L) = 262.0 + 2 118.0 (EQM [U/mL]).
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed mathematical models allow conversion of cholinesterase 
activity values using the Michel, EQM, and Monotest techniques. These models can 
be of assistance in Colombia and other countries where a variety of measurement
techniques are used, and where it becomes difficult to compare the results of
different studies. Having mathematical models available for conversion of
established values can be beneficial whether for clinical or epidemiological
purposes.

    J Travel Med. 2008 Jan-Feb;15(1):60; author reply 60-1.

BACKGROUND: Controversy exists about the management of patients with imported
Plasmodium falciparum malaria. We postulated that rapid parasite clearance
supports ambulatory care, or, conversely, that factors associated with longer
parasite clearance time (PCT) could be used as hospitalization criteria.
METHODS: Hospitalized patients with imported falciparum malaria recruited through
one single travel clinic between 1993 and 2000. We used a linear regression to
identify factors independently associated with PCT defined as the time in hours
from antimalarial drug administration until the first negative malaria smear.
RESULTS: Among 400 patients hospitalized with falciparum malaria, mean (range)
PCT was 58 (1-189) hours. In multivariate analysis, severe malaria,
gastrointestinal signs, initial temperature greater than or equal to 40 degrees
C, parasitemia greater than or equal to 1%, and platelet counts less than
50,000/microL were associated with longer PCT. Offering ambulatory care to
patients aged 15 to 64 years with none of the factors associated with longer PCT 
in the study would have resulted in 147 (37%) patients receiving outpatient care.
CONCLUSION: Factors identified in this model may help physicians determine which 
P falciparum malaria patients can be treated on an ambulatory basis, and
contribute to revisions of national guidelines for imported malaria management.

Spatial distribution of Burkitt's lymphoma in Kenya and association with malaria 
risk.

Rainey JJ(1), Mwanda WO, Wairiumu P, Moormann AM, Wilson ML, Rochford R.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Epidemiology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.

Endemic Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) is the most common paediatric malignancy in
equatorial Africa and was originally shown to occur at high-incidence rates in
regions where malaria transmission is holoendemic. New ecological models of
malaria that are based on both parasite prevalence and disease have been
described. In this study, we examined district level data collected from
paediatric BL cases in Kenya from 1988 through 1997 and assessed whether the
distribution of district level incidence rates could be explained by new ecologic
estimates of malaria risk. Chi-square tests and log-linear regression models were
used to evaluate these associations. An association with tribe of origin as a
factor also was examined. The 10-year average annual incidence rate (IR) for
Kenya was 0.61 per 100,000 children. Incidence rates varied by malaria
transmission intensity as follows: low malaria risk (BL IR = 0.39), arid/seasonal
(0.25), highland (0.66), endemic coast (0.68), and endemic lake (1.23) (chi(2) = 
11.32, P = 0.002). In a log-linear model, BL rates were 3.5 times greater in
regions with chronic and intense malaria transmission intensity than in regions
with no or sporadic malaria transmission (odds ratio = 3.47, 95% confidence
interval = 1.30-9.30), regardless of tribe. Although crude tribe-specific
incidence rates ranged between 0.0 and 3.26, tribe was not associated with BL
after controlling for malaria. These findings support the aetiologic role of
intense malaria transmission intensity in BL.

Haemoglobin and haematocrit: is the threefold conversion valid for assessing
anaemia in malaria-endemic settings?

Carneiro IA(1), Drakeley CJ, Owusu-Agyei S, Mmbando B, Chandramohan D.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Infectious & Tropical Diseases, London School of Hygiene &
Tropical Medicine, Keppel Street, London, UK. ilona.carneiro@lshtm.ac.uk

BACKGROUND: Anaemic status is determined by haemoglobin using the HemoCue system 
or haematocrit measurements, and a threefold conversion is commonly used to
equate the two measures (haemoglobin = haematocrit/3). The validity of this
conversion in malaria endemic settings was assessed.
METHODS: Concurrent measures of haemoglobin and centrifuged haematocrit in
children aged 6-59 months were compared by modelling the difference between the
two measures against their average. A random effects linear regression of the
difference of the measures on their average was used to describe the line of best
agreement and 95% limits of agreement for these two measures over a range of
values after adjusting for statistically significant covariates.
RESULTS: There was a consistent bias between the two measures, with haemoglobin
less than haematocrit/3 in 87% (899/1,030) of observations. This difference was
non-uniform, decreasing with the average measure, i.e. less difference at higher 
haemoglobin and haematocrit values. In these studies, use of haematocrit would
have underestimated the prevalence of anaemia by misclassifying 10% (89/920) of
individuals with haemoglobin < 11 g/dl, 66% (252/380) of individuals with
haemoglobin < 8 g/dl and 100% (23/23) of individuals with haemoglobin < 5 g/dl.
The mean difference between the measures was greater in males than females,
increased with age between 6-59 months, and was greater in the wet than dry
season suggesting that the relationship between haemoglobin and haematocrit may
be modified by exposure to malaria.
CONCLUSION: The regression model indicated that the standard threefold conversion
from haematocrit to haemoglobin underestimates the prevalence of haemoglobin < 11
g/dl in children under five years of age in malaria endemic settings. This bias
was more acute for more severe anaemia defined by haemoglobin < 8 g/dl and
haemoglobin < 5 g/dl. This has important implications for the comparability of
studies using these different measures. Direct determination of haemoglobin
should be the measurement of choice for assessing anaemia outcomes in malaria
intervention trials and surveys.

The association between HIV and Wuchereria bancrofti, and the role of malaria and
hookworms, were analysed by comparing three groups of individuals with: (1) HIV
(HIV+; n=16); (2) W. bancrofti (circulating filarial antigen (CFA)+; n=25); and
(3) HIV and W. bancrofti (HIV+/CFA+; n=18). A slightly higher HIV load and lower 
CD4% was observed in the HIV+/CFA+ group compared with the HIV+ group, and a
slightly higher W. bancrofti CFA intensity was observed in the CFA+ group
compared with the HIV+/CFA+ group, but none of these differences were
statistically significant. Specific and non-specific IL-4, IL-10, IFNgamma and
TNF levels were measured. Only specific IL-4 was significantly higher in the CFA+
group compared with the HIV+/CFA+ group. Thus, there was no clear evidence for an
interaction between HIV and W. bancrofti infection. A multiple linear regression 
model showed that the presence of CFA was strongly positively associated with
specific TNF response and, similarly, that HIV-positive individuals had higher
TNF responses than HIV-negative individuals. Interestingly, the CD4% and CD4/CD8 
ratio were higher in HIV-positive individuals with hookworms than in those
without hookworm co-infection. Malaria was not associated with any of the other
infections, or with CD4/CD8 counts or cytokine responses.

Développement, Paris, France. lisedenoeud@yahoo.fr

BACKGROUND: In areas of stable transmission, malaria during pregnancy is
associated with severe maternal and foetal outcomes, especially low birth weight 
(LBW). To prevent these complications, weekly chloroquine (CQ) chemoprophylaxis
is now being replaced by intermittent preventive treatment with
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine in West Africa. The prevalence of placental malaria and
its burden on LBW were assessed in Benin to evaluate the efficacy of weekly CQ
chemoprophylaxis, prior to its replacement by intermittent preventive treatment.
METHODS: In two maternity clinics in Ouidah, an observational study was conducted
between April 2004 and April 2005. At each delivery, placental blood smears were 
examined for malaria infection and women were interviewed on their pregnancy
history including CQ intake and dosage. CQ was measured in the urine of a
sub-sample (n = 166). Multiple logistic and linear regression were used to assess
factors associated with LBW and placental malaria.
RESULTS: Among 1090 singleton live births, prevalence of placental malaria and
LBW were 16% and 17% respectively. After adjustment, there was a non-significant 
association between placental malaria and LBW (adjusted OR = 1.43; P = 0.10).
Multiple linear regression showed a positive association between placental
malaria and decreased birth weight in primigravidae. More than 98% of the women
reported regular chemoprophylaxis and CQ was detectable in 99% of urine samples. 
Protection from LBW was high in women reporting regular CQ prophylaxis, with a
strong duration-effect relationship (test for linear trend: P < 0,001).
CONCLUSION: Despite high parasite resistance and limited effect on placental
malaria, a CQ chemoprophylaxis taken at adequate doses showed to be still
effective in reducing LBW in Benin.

living in a malaria area in the Limpopo Province, South Africa.

The pesticide DDT [1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(chlorodiphenyl)ethane] is 1 of the 12 
persistent organic pollutants (POPs) under negotiation at the Stockholm
Convention to restrict or ban their production and use because of their toxicity,
resistance to breakdown, bioaccumulation, and potential for being transported
over long distances. DDT has estrogenic potential, and the main metabolite,
p,p'-dichlorodiphenyl-dichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE), is a potent antiandrogen. In
response to mounting evidence on the endocrine-disrupting influence of
environmental chemicals on human health, this epidemiological study was initiated
to test the hypothesis that nonoccupational exposure to DDT affects male
reproductive parameters. In a cross-sectional study, healthy male subjects
(n=311) between 18 and 40 years (23+/-5) of age were recruited from 3 communities
in an endemic malaria area in which DDT is sprayed annually. A semen analysis
according to World Health Organization (WHO) standards was performed. The
Hamilton Thorne Computer Assisted Sperm Analysis (CASA) system was simultaneously
used to determine additional sperm motility parameters. Blood plasma samples were
assayed for p,p'-DDT and metabolites as a measure of exposure. The exposure
levels were expressed as lipid-adjusted p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE values. The mean
p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE concentrations were 90.23 microg/g(+/-102.4) and 215.47
microg/g(+/-210.6), respectively. The multivariate linear regression analyses
indicated that mean CASA motility was lower with a higher p,p'-DDE concentration 
(beta=-0.02, P=.001) and the CASA parameter beat cross-frequency (BCF) was higher
with a higher p,p'-DDT concentration (beta=0.01, P=.000). There was also a
statistically significant positive association between percent sperm with
cytoplasmic droplets and p,p'-DDT concentration (beta=0.0014, P=.014). The
ejaculate volume (mean 1.9+/-1.33 mL) was lower than the normal range (>or=2.0
mL) according to WHO, and a significant decrease with increasing p,p'-DDE values 
was seen for both square root-transformed volume (beta=-0.0003; P=.024) and count
(beta=-0.003; P=.04). Although there were no associations between either p,p'-DDT
or p,p'-DDE concentrations and the rest of the seminal parameters, the incidence 
of teratozoospermia (99%; normal sperm<15%) was high. Twenty-eight percent of the
study group presented with oligozoospermia (<20x10(6) sperm/mL), which had a
significant positive association with p,p'-DDE (odds ratio [OR]=1.001, P=.03).
There was a significant positive association between participants with
asthenozoospermia (32%) and p,p'-DDT (OR 1.003, P=.006) and p,p'-DDE (OR 1.001,
P=.02). The results imply that nonoccupational exposure to DDT is associated with
impaired seminal parameters in men. The high exposure levels of p,p'-DDT and
p,p'-DDE are of concern because these levels could have far-reaching implications
for reproductive and general health.

The blood level of soluble urokinase receptor (suPAR) is increased and associated
with a poor clinical or fatal outcome in children with acute malaria. This study 
hypothesized that the suPAR level would be associated with foetal outcome in
maternal malaria. suPAR was measured by ELISA in maternal and cord plasma samples
taken during delivery in 253 pregnant Kenyan women stratified according to
placental histology: no malaria infection (non-infected), active or
active-chronic infection (actively infected) or past-chronic infection
(past-infected). Maternal-suPAR was higher in actively infected women (median
3.93 (IQR 2.92-5.29) ng/mL) compared with non-infected (median 2.78 (IQR
1.86-3.87) ng/mL, P = 0.001) and past-infected (median 2.67 (IQR 1.94-3.7) ng/mL,
P = 0.012) women. Cord-suPAR was comparable across the groups (median 2.98 (IQR
2.38-3.77) ng/mL). In actively infected women, maternal-suPAR and gestational age
were the only independent predictors of birth weight in multivariate linear
regression adjusted for maternal-suPAR, HIV-1 infection, age, BMI, haemoglobin,
peripheral parasitaemia, parity and gestational age; 1 ng/mL higher
maternal-suPAR predicted -56 g (95% CI -100 to -12, P = 0.016) reduced birth
weight. Cord-suPAR could not predict birth weight after adjusting for gestational
age. Future studies are warranted to investigate whether the maternal suPAR level
is increased earlier in pregnancy in women with active placental malaria
infection and whether early maternal suPAR measurements can predict birth weight.
If so, measurements of maternal suPAR early in pregnancy might then potentially
identify women with increased needs for antenatal care and intervention.

Male circumcision, religion, and infectious diseases: an ecologic analysis of 118
developing countries.

BACKGROUND: Both religious practices and male circumcision (MC) have been
associated with HIV and other sexually-transmitted infectious diseases. Most
studies have been limited in size and have not adequately controlled for
religion, so these relationships remain unclear.
METHODS: We evaluated relationships between MC prevalence, Muslim and Christian
religion, and 7 infectious diseases using country-specific data among 118
developing countries. We used multivariate linear regression to describe
associations between MC and cervical cancer incidence, and between MC and HIV
prevalence among countries with primarily sexual HIV transmission.
RESULTS: Fifty-three, 14, and 51 developing countries had a high (>80%),
intermediate (20-80%), and low (<20%) MC prevalence, respectively. In univariate 
analyses, MC was associated with lower HIV prevalence and lower cervical cancer
incidence, but not with HSV-2, syphilis, nor, as expected, with Hepatitis C,
tuberculosis, or malaria. In multivariate analysis after stratifying the
countries by religious groups, each categorical increase of MC prevalence was
associated with a 3.65/100,000 women (95% CI 0.54-6.76, p = 0.02) decrease in
annual cervical cancer incidence, and a 1.84-fold (95% CI 1.36-2.48, p < 0.001)
decrease in the adult HIV prevalence among sub-Saharan African countries. In
separate multivariate analyses among non-sub-Saharan African countries
controlling for religion, higher MC prevalence was associated with a 8.94-fold
(95% CI 4.30-18.60) decrease in the adult HIV prevalence among countries with
primarily heterosexual HIV transmission, but not, as expected, among countries
with primarily homosexual or injection drug use HIV transmission (p = 0.35).
CONCLUSION: Male circumcision was significantly associated with lower cervical
cancer incidence and lower HIV prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa, independent of
Muslim and Christian religion. As predicted, male circumcision was also strongly 
associated with lower HIV prevalence among countries with primarily heterosexual 
HIV transmission, but not among countries with primarily homosexual or injection 
drug use HIV transmission. These findings strengthen the reported biological link
between MC and some sexually transmitted infectious diseases, including HIV and
cervical cancer.

Treatment efficacy is related to the interaction of three parameters: drug,
parasites, and human factors. The role of human factors in treatment outcome has 
been poorly documented to date, although human genetic factors and specific
immunity have been related to protection against malaria. This study aimed to
evaluate a possible cooperation between drug efficacy and host factors in
treatment success. The contribution of host factors to treatment efficacy was
studied in Gabonese children with a non-severe malaria attack. Children (n=232)
aged under 10 years were treated with either sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine or
amodiaquine. The influence of erythrocyte-related genetic factors and humoral
immune responses (IgG and subclasses) against MSP1(19) on anti-malarial treatment
outcome during a 28-day follow-up was studied. Sickle-cell trait carriage and
anti-MSP1(19) IgG3 levels were related to lower parasite densities at enrolment
(multiple linear regression analysis, P<or=0.005). Strikingly, early failures
after AQ or SP treatment were associated with decreased anti-MSP1(19) IgG, IgG1
and IgG3 levels at enrolment. However, this finding was achieved in a low number 
of children presenting with an early failure. Kinetics of anti-MSP1(19) IgG and
subclasses between Days 0 and 28 were also related to treatment efficacy, as the 
most effective treatment (sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine) was characterised by a
higher elevation of antibody titres by Day 28. No effect of erythrocyte-related
genetic factors on treatment outcome was shown, although the protective role of
sickle-cell trait against higher parasitaemias was confirmed at enrolment. Our
data suggest that anti-MSP1(19) IgG1 may have a supportive role during the first 
days of treatment to prevent early failures. The interference between drug
efficacy, immunity and human genetic factors needs further investigation to be
elucidated.

Radiation-induced sterility for pupal and adult stages of the malaria mosquito
Anopheles arabiensis.

BACKGROUND: In the context of the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT),
radiation-induced sterility in the malaria mosquito Anopheles arabiensis Patton
(Diptera: Culicidae) was studied. Male mosquitoes were exposed to gamma rays in
the pupal or adult stage and dose-sterility curves were determined.
METHODS: Pupae were irradiated shortly before emergence (at 22-26 hrs of age),
and adults <24 hrs post emergence. Doses tested ranged between 0 and 100 Gy. The 
effects of irradiation on adult emergence, male survival, induced sterility and
insemination capability were evaluated. Emergence and insemination data were
analysed using independent t-tests against the control. Correlation analyses were
performed for insemination rate and dose and insemination and fecundity. Male
survival was analysed using Kaplan-Meier survival analyses. Finally, the
calculated residual fertility values were inverse-normal transformed and linear
regression analyses performed.
RESULTS: Irradiation of pupae, for all doses tested, had no effect on adult
emergence. Survival curves of males irradiated as pupae or adults were similar or
even slightly higher than non-irradiated males. Overall, adults appeared to be
slightly more susceptible to irradiation, although no significant differences for
individual doses were observed. In the pupal stage, a significant negative
correlation was found between insemination and dose, but the
correlation-coefficient was associated with less than 25% of the total variation.
A review of the literature indicated that An. arabiensis is more radiation
resistant than other anopheline mosquitoes.
CONCLUSION: The optimal dose for male insects to be released in an SIT programme 
depends on their level of sterility and competitiveness. The use of
semi-sterilizing doses to produce more competitive insects is discussed. The most
convenient developmental stage for mosquito irradiation on a mass-scale are
pupae, but pupal irradiation resulted in a lower insemination rate at the highest
dose compared to adult irradiation. On the basis of this study, a suitable dose
range that includes semi-sterilizing doses is identified to initiate
competitiveness experiments for males irradiated at both developmental stages.

Failure of twice-weekly iron supplementation to increase blood haemoglobin and
serum ferritin concentrations: results of a randomized controlled trial.

In order to increase the intestinal absorption of iron whilst simultaneously
minimising the side-effects and thus increasing compliance, once- or
twice-weekly, instead of daily, iron supplementation has been widely recommended.
In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study in western Kenya, a
tablet of ferrous dextran (containing 60 mg elemental iron) or an
identical-looking placebo tablet was provided twice-weekly for 12 months to each 
child or adult investigated. At baseline each subject had a moderately low blood 
concentration of haemoglobin (Hb). Initial Hb and serum ferritin (SF)
concentrations were determined and each subject was tested for malarial and
helminth infection and treated, if necessary, with the appropriate anthelminthic 
drug(s). Overall, 200 children (aged 4-15 years) and 129 adults (aged 16-63
years) completed the 12-month study. At baseline, 47.5% of the children and 58.1%
of the adults were anaemic, hookworm (detected in 60.0% of the children and 69.9%
of the adults) was the most common helminth infection, and malaria was endemic.
The results of bivariate analyses indicated that twice-weekly iron
supplementation had no significant effect on blood Hb or SF concentrations,
either in the children or the adults investigated. The results were confirmed in 
multiple linear-regression analyses, which revealed that the predictors of the
final Hb concentration in the children investigated were age and infection, after
enrollment, with Ascaris lumbricoides. Gender and the serum concentration of
alpha-1-antichymotrypsin (ACT) at final follow-up were predictors of the final SF
concentration in the children. In adults, the predictors of the final Hb
concentration were gender and HIV infection, and the predictors of the final SF
concentration were age and the serum concentration of ACT at the final follow-up.
Twice-weekly iron supplementation did not increase Hb or iron stores in children 
or adults. Since compliance appeared to be high, this lack of effect may be the
result of an inadequate dose of iron or of subjects who have deficiencies in
micronutrients other than iron.

Association of serum transferrin receptor concentration with markers of
inflammation in Zimbabwean children.

Sciences, Harare, Zimbabwe. ikasvosve@medsch.uz.ac.zw <ikasvosve@medsch.uz.ac.zw>

BACKGROUND: Clinical studies have shown that degree of erythropoiesis, the
hypoxic response, and iron status each independently influences transferrin
receptor concentration, but there is conflicting information regarding the effect
of inflammation on transferrin receptor expression.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Levels of hemoglobin, reticulocytes, serum ferritin,
transferrin receptors and inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, interleukin-6
and neutrophils) were determined in 208 Zimbabwean children <or=5 years attending
well-child clinics in a non-malaria transmission, non-hookworm area.
RESULTS: In linear regression models among 147 children with ferritin >10 ng/mL
that adjusted for erythropoiesis with log(10) reticulocyte count, the hypoxic
response with hemoglobin concentration and iron status with log(10) ferritin
concentration, positive correlations were found between log(10) transferrin
receptor concentration and log(10) C-reactive protein concentration (P=0.012),
log(10) interleukin-6 concentration (P=0.011) and log(10) neutrophil count
(P=0.013). These models predict that, with a baseline transferrin receptor
concentration in the upper normal range of 8.0 mg/L and holding hemoglobin
concentration and reticulocyte count constant, an increase from 1 to 10 mg/L in
C-reactive protein is associated with a rise of 1.6 mg/L in transferrin receptor 
(95% C.I. 0.3-3.0 mg/L), an increase from 0.5-to-5.0 pg/mL in interleukin-6 with 
a rise of 1.9 mg/L (0.4-3.7 mg/L), and an increase from 2000 to 20,000/microL in 
neutrophil count with a rise of 3.6 mg/L (0.7-7.5 mg/L).
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that inflammation leads to an increase in
circulating transferrin receptor concentration that is independent of the degree 
of erythropoiesis, the hypoxic response and iron status.

AIM: To evaluate the number of platelets and the title of anti-platelet
antibodies IgG Ac-PI (by flow cytometry) in patients with non-complicated
malaria.
METHODS: Descriptive, prospective and longitudinal study from 45 patients (aged
among 14-67). Thirty patients were followed during 7 days.
RESULTS: A) Pretreatment: it was found malarial thrombocytopenia (MT) in 71 % and
significant association between MT and Ac-PI in 33 %. MT was not associated to
residence zone, to have had malaria in the last year and Plasmodium species but
sex associated (males, p= 0.02078195), although, the Ac-PI titers of male and
female was similar. Correspondingly, the number of platelets was statistically
similar to the values of above variables. There was a low and an inverse lineal
correlation between platelets and titres of Ac-P1 (r= -0.342 (p= 0.02310)). B)
During the following, multiple linear regression among platelets, age, years of
residence in the zone, number of malaria episodes in the last year, parasitaemia 
(logarithmically expressed) and Ac-P1 titers showed no significant coefficient
and the maximum explanation achieved (17%) was parasitaemia and Ac-P1 titers.
Similar analysis among Ac-P1 and age, years of residence in the zone number of
malaria episodes in the last year, parasitaemia (logarithmically expressed)
showed that the first three explain 38 % of the changes in Ac-P1, whereas malaria
episodes and years of residence in the zone explain 28%.

Yemen.

The aim of study was to investigate the role of climate on the Malaria Incidence 
Rates (MIR) in some regions in of Yemen. For such purpose, the monthly (MIR) were
calculated from the records of the hospitals' laboratories and centers of the
Malaria Rollback centers in the main cities of the governorates Hudeidah, Taiz,
Sana'a and Hadramout for the period 1989-1998. The readings of the climatic
factors (CF) particularly the average monthly temperature (T), relative humidity 
(RH), volume of rain fall (RF) and wind speed (WS) for the same period of time
were also collected from different weather and climatic information resources.
Descriptive statistics, simple linear regression and multiple linear regression
techniques were used to analyse the relationship between MIR and CF. The analysis
shows highly significant relationship between MIR and the CF in these regions of 
Yemen (p-value 0.001).

The pesticide p,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and its persistent
metabolite p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) are associated with
negative reproductive outcomes in animals. In humans, however, the findings are
inconsistent. Using data from the Child Health and Development Studies, a
longitudinal study of 20,754 pregnancies among San Francisco Bay Area women from 
1959 to 1967, the authors examined the effects of maternal serum DDT and DDE
concentrations on preterm birth, small-for-gestational-age birth, birth weight,
and gestational age in 420 male subjects. Data were analyzed using multivariate
logistic regression for preterm and small-for-gestational-age birth and linear
regression for birth weight and gestational age. Median serum concentrations of
DDE were 43 mug/liter (interquartile range: 32-57; range: 7-153) and of DDT were 
11 mug/liter (interquartile range: 8-16; range: 3-72), several times higher than 
current US concentrations. The adjusted odds ratio for preterm birth was 1.28
(95% confidence interval (CI): 0.73, 2.23) for DDE and 0.94 (95% CI: 0.50, 1.78) 
for DDT. For small-for-gestational-age birth, the adjusted odds ratio was 0.75
(95% CI: 0.44, 1.26) for DDE and 0.69 (95% CI: 0.73, 1.27) for DDT; none of the
study results achieved statistical significance. Given the persistence of DDT in 
the environment and its continuing role in malaria control, studies using more
robust data should continue to assess this relation.

Plasma concentrations of soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor
are increased in patients with malaria and are associated with a poor clinical or
a fatal outcome.

BACKGROUND: Blood concentrations of soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator 
receptor (suPAR) are increased in conditions with immune activation, and high
concentrations of suPAR often predict a poor clinical outcome. This study
explored the hypothesis that high plasma concentrations of suPAR are associated
with disease severity in malaria.
METHODS: At admission to the hospital, plasma concentrations of suPAR were
measured by ELISA in samples from 645 African children with clinical symptoms of 
malaria: 478 had malaria, and 167 had a blood film negative for Plasmodium
parasites. Fourteen healthy children were included for comparison.
RESULTS: Plasma concentrations of suPAR were higher in patients with malaria
(median, 7.90 ng/mL [interquartile range [IQR], 6.56-9.15 ng/mL]), compared with 
those in plasmodium-negative patients (median, 5.59 ng/mL [IQR, 4.54-8.16 ng/mL];
P < .001) and those in healthy children (3.94 ng/mL [IQR, 3.46-4.82 ng/mL]; P <
.001). The highest concentrations were found in patients with malaria who died (P
= .008) or had complicated malaria (P < .001). In univariate logistic regression 
analysis, a 1 ng/mL increase in plasma concentration of suPAR was associated with
increased risk of mortality (odds ratio, 1.42 [95% confidence interval,
1.09-1.86]; P = .009). In multivariate linear regression analysis, lower platelet
count, lower hemoglobin level, and higher neutrophil count were independently
associated with a higher plasma concentration of suPAR.
CONCLUSIONS: If the plasma concentration of suPAR reflects the extent of
parasite-induced immune activation, this may explain why a high concentration of 
suPAR is associated with a poor clinical outcome in patients with malaria.

A series of thioacridone compounds that were previously shown to have DNA binding
interaction, were screened for antimalarial activity. The new compounds were
assessed for in vitro antimalarial activity against a chloroquine sensitive (D10)
strain of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, using a lactate
dehydrogenase (PfLDH) assay. In the series, the IC(50) values ranged from 0.4 to 
27 microg/ml. 1-(2-Dimethylaminoethylamino)-9(10H)-thioacridone was found to be
the most potent against P. falciparum (D10) with an IC(50) value of 0.4
microg/ml. This compound was also evaluated against a South African chloroquine
resistant (RSA 11) P. falciparum strain and was found to have an IC(50) value of 
1 microg/ml, compared with 0.16 microg/ml for chloroquine. Quantitative
structure-activity relationships of this series were also investigated and a
multiple linear regression r(2) of 0.58 was found for the best fit equation. The 
most potent compound, 1-(2-dimethylaminoethylamino)-9(10H)-thioacridone, was
docked into the chloroquine binding site of PfLDH and it was found that the
slightly lower activity of this compound, compared with chloroquine, is likely
due to steric interference within a restricted binding pocket.

    Lancet. 2005 Jan 15-21;365(9455):196-7.

BACKGROUND: Raised HIV viral load in blood has been associated with accelerated
disease progression and increased transmission of infection. To assess the effect
of Plasmodium falciparum malaria on concentrations of HIV in blood, we did a
prospective cohort study in Malawi.
METHODS: We recruited 367 HIV-1-infected adults. Among 334 people aparasitaemic
at baseline, 148 had at least one malaria episode during follow-up and received
antimalarial treatment. Of these, 77 had HIV-1-RNA measurements at baseline,
during malaria, and post-malaria. We used linear regression with generalised
estimating equations to assess effect of four definitions of malaria (any
parasitaemia, parasite density > or =2000/microL, febrile parasitaemia, and
febrile parasitaemia with parasite density > or =2000/microl) on changes in log
HIV-1 RNA, overall and by baseline CD4 count.
FINDINGS: With malaria defined as any parasitaemia, HIV-1-RNA concentration
almost doubled between baseline (median 96215 copies per mL) and malaria (168901 
copies per mL), a 0.25 (95% CI 0.11-0.39) log increase in mean RNA concentration.
HIV-1-RNA concentration fell to median 82058 copies per mL by about 8-9 weeks
post-malaria. Increases in HIV-1-RNA were greatest for people with fever,
parasite density 2000/microL or greater, and CD4 count more than 300 cells per
muL, in whom concentrations rose from median 38483 copies per mL at baseline to
196098 copies per mL during malaria, a mean log increase of 0.82 (95% CI
0.55-1.10, p<0.0001), and fell to median 75331 copies per mL post-malaria. People
who remained aparasitaemic showed no changes in HIV-1-RNA concentration.
INTERPRETATION: HIV-infected individuals with malaria have a significantly
increased viral load, which might enhance HIV transmission and accelerate disease
progression.

Malaria transmission is a multifactorial phenomenon. Climate is a major limiting 
factor in the spatial and temporal distribution of malaria, but many non-climatic
factors may alter or override the effect of climate. Thirty years of monthly
malaria incidence data from KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa, reveal strong
medium and long-term trends, which were not present in the climate data. This
paper explores various non-climatic factors that may have contributed towards the
observed trends. The development of antimalarial drug resistance, available
information on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalence, cross-border people
movements, agricultural activities, emergence of insecticide resistance and the
case reporting system are reviewed and their potential effect on malaria
transmission examined. Single-variable linear regression analysis showed
significant association between seasonal case totals (log-transformed) and the
measured level of drug resistance (log-transformed) (r2=0.558, n=10, P=0.013) as 
well as relative measures of HIV infection since 1990 (r2=0.846, n=11, P=0.001). 
The other factors appear to have affected the level of malaria transmission at
certain periods and to some degree. The importance of surveillance and inclusion 
of non-climatic variables in analysis of malaria data is demonstrated.

Large parts of Africa are prone to malaria epidemics. Advance epidemic warning
would give health services an opportunity to prepare. Because malaria
transmission is largely limited by climate, climate-based epidemic warning
systems are a real possibility. To develop and test such a system, good long-term
malaria and climate data are needed. In KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), South Africa, 30
years of confirmed malaria case data provide a unique opportunity to examine
short- and long-term trends. We analysed seasonal case totals and seasonal
changes in cases (both log-transformed) against a range of climatic indicators
obtained from three weather stations in the highest malaria incidence districts, 
using linear regression analysis. Seasonal changes in case numbers (delta log
cases, dlc) were significantly associated with several climate variables. The two
most significant ones were mean maximum daily temperatures from January to
October of the preceding season (n=30, r2=0.364, P=0.0004) and total rainfall
during the current summer months of November-March (n=30, r2=0.282, P=0.003).
These two variables, when entered into the same regression model, together
explained 49.7% of the total variation in dlc. We found no evidence of
association between case totals and climate. In KZN, where malaria control
operations are intense, climate appears to drive the interannual variation of
malaria incidence, but not its overall level. The accompanying paper provides
evidence that overall levels are associated with non-climatic factors such as
drug resistance and possibly HIV prevalence.

BACKGROUND: Remote sensing technology provides detailed spectral and thermal
images of the earth's surface from which surrogate ecological indicators of
complex processes can be measured. METHODS: Remote sensing data were overlaid
onto georeferenced entomological and human ecological data randomly sampled
during April and May 2001 in the cities of Kisumu (population asymptotically
equal to 320,000) and Malindi (population asymptotically equal to 81,000), Kenya.
Grid cells of 270 meters x 270 meters were used to generate spatial sampling
units for each city for the collection of entomological and human ecological
field-based data. Multispectral Thermal Imager (MTI) satellite data in the
visible spectrum at five meter resolution were acquired for Kisumu and Malindi
during February and March 2001, respectively. The MTI data were fit and
aggregated to the 270 meter x 270 meter grid cells used in field-based sampling
using a geographic information system. The normalized difference vegetation index
(NDVI) was calculated and scaled from MTI data for selected grid cells.
Regression analysis was used to assess associations between NDVI values and
entomological and human ecological variables at the grid cell level. RESULTS:
Multivariate linear regression showed that as household density increased, mean
grid cell NDVI decreased (global F-test = 9.81, df 3,72, P-value = <0.01;
adjusted R2 = 0.26). Given household density, the number of potential anopheline 
larval habitats per grid cell also increased with increasing values of mean grid 
cell NDVI (global F-test = 14.29, df 3,36, P-value = <0.01; adjusted R2 = 0.51). 
CONCLUSIONS: NDVI values obtained from MTI data were successfully overlaid onto
georeferenced entomological and human ecological data spatially sampled at a
scale of 270 meters x 270 meters. Results demonstrate that NDVI at such a scale
was sufficient to describe variations in entomological and human ecological
parameters across both cities.

In concurrent infections in vivo, the blood stages of Plasmodium vivax suppress
those of Plasmodium falciparum. To see if the paroxysm (i.e. the periodic febrile
episode) of P. vivax infection contributes to this suppression, sera from a P.
vivax-infected volunteer were added to cultures of whole blood taken from cases
of P. falciparum malaria. The crude 'rate' of schizont generation from the ring
forms, measured as the percentage of all asexual parasites that were schizonts
after incubation for 24 h, was similar whether the cultures contained serum
samples collected during paroxysms or those collected, from the same volunteer,
at other times (19.1% v. 18.9%; P=0.842). After a random-effect linear regression
was used to adjust for disparities between the P. falciparum isolates, however,
the degree of schizont maturation, measured as the mean number of nuclei per
schizont, was significantly lower for the cultures with 'paroxysm serum' than for
those with 'non-paroxysm serum' (4.8 v. 5.3; P=0.002). The proportion of
schizonts considered mature was also significantly lower when 'paroxysm serum'
was used (3.7% v. 6.3%: P=0.03). This appears to be the first in-vitro study in
which sera collected during a paroxysm of P. vivax have been shown to inhibit the
maturation of P. falciparum schizonts. The role of this mechanism in intra- and
inter-specific competition is discussed.

pregnant Zimbabwean women.

University, Frederiksberg, Denmark. h.friis@pubhealth.ku.dk

BACKGROUND: Viral load is a determinant of HIV-1 progression and transmission.
Iron status and the phenotype of haptoglobin, a heme-binding acute phase
reactant, may be determinants of viral load. We aimed to describe the effect of
iron status, haptoglobin phenotype (Hp), and other predictors on HIV-1 viral
load.
METHODS: Based on a cross-sectional study among 1669 antenatal care attenders
(22-35 weeks) in Zimbabwe, 526 (31.5%) were found to be HIV infected. The role of
season, age, gravidity, gestational age, malaria parasitemia, Hp, and elevated
serum alpha(1)-antichymotrypsin (ACT) as well as serum ferritin, folate, retinol,
and beta-carotene on HIV viral load among the 526 HIV-infected women was assessed
using multiple linear regression analysis.
RESULTS: The distribution of Hp 1-1 (32%), Hp 2-1 (48%), and Hp 2-2 (20%) was not
different from that of 53 uninfected women. Mean viral load was 3.85 log(10) (95%
CI: 3.77-3.93) genome equivalents (geq)/mL, ranging from 3.77 (95% CI: 3.64-3.90)
geq/mL in women with Hp 1-1 to 4.05 (95% CI: 3.81-4.21) geq/mL in women with Hp
2-2. With elevated serum ACT controlled for, women with Hp 2-2 had viral loads
twice (95% CI: 1.4-4.0, p =.002) that of women with Hp 1-1, whereas those with
serum ferritin <6 micro g/L had viral loads less than one third (95% CI:
0.13-0.53, p =.013) that of women with serum ferritin >24 micro g/L. Viral loads 
were also higher in women enrolled in the early rainy season compared with the
dry season, in gravidae 4+ compared with gravidae 1 through 3, and in those with 
moderately elevated compared with low serum alpha(1)-antichymotrypsin, but
neither age, gestational age, serum folate, serum retinol, nor serum
beta-carotene were predictors.
CONCLUSION: Storage iron, Hp 2-2, and elevated ACT are independent positive
predictors of HIV-1 viral load. The positive relationship between serum ferritin 
and viral load was not the result of an acute phase response or iron accumulation
with advanced HIV infection. A possible detrimental role of iron in HIV infection
would have serious public health implications.

Self-reported compliance with last malaria treatment and occurrence of malaria
during follow-up in a Brazilian Amazon population.

Author information: 
(1)Pan American Health Organization, Special Program for Health Analysis/Health
Analysis and Information System, 525 23rd Street N.W., Washington DC 20037, USA.

The objective of this study was to describe the association between self-reported
compliance with last malaria treatment (CMT) and occurrence of malaria during
follow-up, controlling for current risk factors. We conducted a prospective open 
cohort study in Leonislândia, a rural area of Peixoto de Azevedo City, in the
Amazon region of Mato Grosso, Brazil. A total of 414 individuals were interviewed
at baseline regarding CMT and followed-up for either 8 or 4 months to assess
malaria incidence. The associations between CMT and occurrence of malaria were
examined through multiple linear regression (when the outcome was malaria episode
frequency) or Cox regression (when the outcome was time to malaria onset). Poor
CMT (prior to baseline) was identified as an important predictor of the
occurrence of subsequent malaria episodes during follow-up among individuals with
an indication of being less immune - those whose first malaria episode was
relatively recent or those who had an increased number of malaria episodes during
the last 2 years. Moreover, surprisingly, it seems that for individuals who are
probably more immune (individuals who had experienced their first malaria episode
more than 4.5 years previously or those with few or no malaria episodes during
the last 2 years), CMT was found to be a poor predictor of increased risk of
subsequent malaria. These findings provide compelling evidence for the need to
further study CMT and its effect on malaria outcomes.

OBJECTIVE: To study the synergistic action of a combination of guanghuoxiang
volatile oil (B) and sodium artesunate (SA) against Plasmodium berghei (P. b) and
the resistance-reversal activity against SA-resistant P. b (P. b SA-R).
METHODS: Mice infected with P. b N or P. b R were treated with a combination of B
and SA respectively by 4-day suppressive test method and linear regression to
calculate the SD50 of B and SA for each drug alone and in combination (equally
effective dose compatibility).
RESULTS: B alone, N:SD50 = 87.64 +/- 19.58(GKD), R:SD50 = 43.24 +/- 7.71(GKD); SA
alone, N:SD50 = 0.88 +/- 0.01(MGKD), R:SD50 = 27.69 +/- 0.93(MGKD). B and SA
combination, N:B SD50 = 36.89 +/- 4.57(GKD), SA SD50 = 0.39 +/- 0.05 (MGKD); R:B 
SD50 = 7.40 +/- 1.30(GKD), SA SD50 = 4.21 +/- 0.74(MGKD). The synergistic indexes
of B and SA in combination were 2.2 for N and 6.6 for R, respectivly. The
multiple of resistance reversal of B vs SA was 6.6. The relative reversal rate
was 87.6%.
CONCLUSION: A combination of B and SA may enhance the antimalarial effect against
P. b and reverse the SA-resistance of P. b and delay the occurrence of resistance
to SA in N.

HIV-1 viral load and elevated serum alpha(1)-antichymotrypsin are independent
predictors of body composition in pregnant Zimbabwean women.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection affects body composition, but their 
relationship has not been studied in pregnant women. We conducted a
cross-sectional study among 1669 women receiving antenatal care between 22 and 35
wk of gestation in Harare, Zimbabwe. The role of HIV-1 status and viral load,
malaria and elevated serum alpha(1)-antichymotrypsin (ACT, an acute phase
protein) in weight, body mass index (BMI), arm circumference (AC), triceps
skinfold thickness (TSF), and arm muscle (AMA) and fat (AFA) area were assessed
using multiple linear regression analysis. The mean (range) age was 24.4 (14-45) 
y and gestational age 29 (22-35) wk. HIV infection was present in 31.5% of the
women, malaria parasitemia in 0.4% and 11.4% had serum ACT >0.4 g/L. There was no
difference in any anthropometric variable between HIV-infected and uninfected
women. However, women with viral loads (genome equivalents/mL) between 4 and 5
and >5 log(10) had 1.1 [95% confidence interval (CI): -0.3, 2.3] and 2.5 (95% CI:
0.1, 5.1) kg lower weights compared with uninfected women; this was explained by 
losses of both AFA and AMA. Malaria parasitemia was associated with 6 cm(2) (95% 
CI: 0.4; 11.8) or 25% lower AMA. Elevated serum ACT was a negative predictor of
all anthropometric variables, i.e., levels between 0.3 and 0.4, 0.4 and 0.5 and
>0.5 g/L were associated with 1, 2 and 6 kg lower mean body weights,
respectively. Despite the limitations of a cross-sectional design, we conclude
that arm fat and muscle areas, reflecting body fat and lean body mass, seem to be
unaffected in the majority of HIV-infected pregnant women, but decline with
increasing viral loads. The effects of viral load are not explained by elevated
serum ACT, which is a strong independent predictor of all anthropometric
variables.

To search for evidence of a protective role of the CD23/NO pathway against
cerebral malaria, concentrations of reactive nitrogen intermediates (RNI) and
sCD21, total immunoglobulin (Ig)E and sCD23 were compared between 17 cases of
cerebral malaria and 33 controls. The geometric mean of sCD23 concentration was
higher among cerebral malaria cases than among controls (optical density
2643/1495, P = 0.01). The ratio between sCD21 and sCD23 was significantly lower
in cerebral malaria cases than in controls (0.67 +/- 0.02 versus 0.77 +/- 0.02,
respectively, P = 0.009). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that, among 
cerebral malaria cases, there was a clear correlation between RNI and both IgE (P
= 0.007) and sCD21 (P < 0.0001). Among controls, there was a strong negative
correlation between RNI and sCD23 concentrations (r = -0.61, P < 0.0001).
However, multivariate analysis unmasked the fact that, in controls, there was
also a positive correlation between RNI and IgE (P = 0.045). Logistic regression 
showed that increased RNI concentrations were associated with a cerebral malaria 
adjusted odds ratio of 1.05 per unit increase [95% confidence interval (CI)
1.006-1.1, P = 0.02] and that an increased ratio between sCD21 and sCD23 was
associated with protection from cerebral malaria (adjusted OR = 0.00001 per unit 
increase (95% CI 0-0.03, P = 0.005). These different immunological profiles
suggest that, among controls, the CD23/NO pathway was chronically stimulated
whereas, in cerebral malaria, its stimulation was acute, which could explain why 
some patients developed cerebral malaria and others did not.

Lack of influence of red palm oil on severity of malaria infection in pre-school 
Nigerian children.

Vitamin A supplements are reported to reduce febrile episodes of malaria and
parasite counts, especially in children aged 12-36 months. Red palm oil (RPO) is 
a good source of vitamin A, is rich in alpha- and beta-carotene and is as
effective as high-dose retinyl palmitate supplements in improving vitamin A
status. In western Nigeria, where malaria is endemic, RPO is widely used and
consumption can be measured using plasma alpha-carotene as a proxy biomarker
since there are few other prominent sources of this carotene in the diet. The
influence of RPO consumption on malaria was investigated in 207 children (aged
0-60 months) who presented with fever in August-October 1999 at several hospital 
clinics around Ile-Ife. Medical and anthropometric data, body temperature,
parasitaemia and plasma C-reactive protein (CRP), retinol, carotenoids and
tocopherols were measured in the children. Mothers were interviewed on usage of
cooking oil and mosquito nets in the home, education and occupation. Most
families used RPO and median plasma concentrations of both alpha-carotene (0.518 
mumol/L) and beta-carotene (0.698 mumol/L) in the children were high. Using body 
temperature, parasite density and plasma CRP as markers of disease severity,
multiple linear regression analysis was carried out on those for whom complete
data were available (n = 138), separated into 3 age-groups of < 12 months (n =
37), 12-36 months (n = 68) and > 36 months (n = 33). In the absence of plasma
retinol, plasma alpha-carotene explained 13.9% of the variance in parasite
density (P = 0.013) but only in children aged > 36 months. The relationship with 
disease severity was negative, i.e., there was some evidence that RPO usage
protected against malaria, and other dietary indices generally indicated that
better nutritional status was associated with a lower severity of malaria.

    Am J Clin Nutr. 2003 May;77(5):1337; author reply 1337-8.

BACKGROUND: Low birth weight (LBW) increases the risk of infant death, but little
is known about its causes among HIV-infected populations in sub-Saharan Africa.
OBJECTIVE: We assessed sociodemographic, nutritional, immunologic, parasitic, and
infant risk factors for birth weight, LBW, and small-for-gestational-age (SGA)
status in a cohort of 822 HIV-positive women enrolled in a clinical trial of
vitamin supplementation and pregnancy outcomes in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
DESIGN: Women were enrolled at prenatal care clinics during their second
trimester, at which time blood, stool, urine, and genital specimens were
collected, and anthropometric measurements and sociodemographic data were
recorded. Birth weight was measured at hospital delivery.
RESULTS: The mean (+/-SD) birth weight was 3015 +/- 508 g, 11.1% of newborns
weighed <2500 g (LBW), and 11.5% were SGA. In multivariate analyses, maternal
weight at enrollment and a low CD8 cell count were inversely associated with LBW.
Advanced-stage HIV disease, previous history of preterm birth, Plasmodium
falciparum malaria, and any helmintic infection were associated with higher risk 
of LBW. The intestinal parasites Entamoeba histolytica and Strongyloides
stercoralis were predictors of LBW despite their low prevalence in the cohort. In
a multivariate-adjusted linear regression model, BMI, midupper arm circumference,
a CD4 cell count <200 x 10(6) cells/L (200 cells/mm(3)), primiparity, maternal
literacy, and infant HIV infection at birth were significantly associated with
birth weight in addition to risk factors included in the LBW model. Determinants 
of SGA included maternal weight, low serum vitamin E concentration, candidiasis, 
malaria, and infant HIV infection at birth.
CONCLUSION: Prevention of HIV disease progression and vertical transmission,
improved nutritional status, and better management of malaria and intestinal
parasitic infections are likely to reduce the incidence of LBW in Tanzania.

University, Frederiksberg, Denmark. hfr@kvl.dk

BACKGROUND: Folate and iron status and hemoglobin concentrations are important to
maternal and infant health.
OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to identify predictors of serum folate, serum ferritin,
and hemoglobin.
DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study of 1669 pregnant women (22-35 wk of
gestation) in Harare, Zimbabwe, who were receiving prenatal care. The statistical
effects of age, season, gestational age, gravidity, HIV-1 infection, malaria
parasitemia, and serum alpha1-antichymotrypsin (ACT) on serum folate, serum
ferritin (log10 transformed), and hemoglobin were estimated by using multiple
linear regression analyses.
RESULTS: Serum folate (x: 11.4 micromol/L) was 0.52-nmol/L (95% CI: 0.04, 1.0)
lower in HIV-infected women than in uninfected women and 0.65-nmol/L (0.014,
1.28) lower in weeks 25-35 than in weeks 22-25. Serum ferritin (geometric x: 11.6
microg/L) was 0.93 times (0.86, 0.99) lower in HIV-infected women and 2.25 times 
(1.41, 3.61) higher in women with malaria parasitemia than in uninfected women.
Similarly, serum ferritin was 0.71 times (0.63, 0.79) higher in weeks 32-35 than 
in weeks 22-25 and 1.21 times (1.12, 1.29) higher in gravida > or =3 than in
gravida 1. Elevated serum ACT was a strong predictor of serum folate, serum
ferritin, and hemoglobin. HIV infection was associated with a 12.9-g/L (8.9,
16.8) lower hemoglobin concentration in women with nondepleted iron stores but
low serum retinol and a 7-8-g/L lower hemoglobin concentration in women with
other combinations of serum ferritin and retinol (P for interaction = 0.038).
Season, age, gestational age, and gravidity were not significant predictors of
hemoglobin. Low serum folate, ferritin, and retinol were associated with low
hemoglobin.
CONCLUSIONS: HIV was associated with lower serum folate, serum ferritin, and
hemoglobin. HIV infection was also associated with lower hemoglobin, particularly
in women with stored iron and low serum retinol. Low serum folate, ferritin, and 
retinol were associated with low hemoglobin.

University, Frederiksberg, Denmark. hfr@kvl.dk

BACKGROUND: Vitamin A status during pregnancy is important to maternal and infant
health.
OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to identify predictors of serum beta-carotene and
retinol.
DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study of 1669 women (22-35 wk of gestation) in
Harare, Zimbabwe, who were receiving prenatal care. The statistical effects of
age, season, gestational age, gravidity, HIV-1 infection, malaria parasitemia,
and serum alpha1-antichymotrypsin (ACT) on serum beta-carotene (log10
transformed) and retinol were estimated by using multiple linear regression
analyses.
RESULTS: HIV infection was found in 31.5% of the women; 0.4% had malaria. Serum
beta-carotene concentrations (geometric x: 0.19 micromol/L) were lower in
HIV-infected women than in uninfected women (10beta = 0.78; 95% CI: 0.72, 0.84)
and increased with age (10beta = 1.05; 1.02, 1.07) in gravida 1 but not in
gravida > or =2 (P for interaction = 0.00002). Serum retinol (x: 0.92 micromol/L)
increased with age (beta = 0.004; 0.0001, 0.008) in uninfected women but not in
HIV-infected women (P for interaction = 0.02) and was 0.05-micromol/L (0.02,
0.09) lower in HIV-infected women than in uninfected women at 24 y of age.
Furthermore, gestational age, season, use of prenatal supplements, and malaria
were predictors of serum beta-carotene. Serum retinol was lower in women carrying
male (beta = -0.04; -0.08, -0.00005) and multiple (beta = -0.21; -0.35, -0.08)
fetuses. Serum ACT concentrations of 0.3-0.4, 0.4-0.5, and >0.5 g/L were
associated with 3%, 11%, and 44% lower serum beta-carotene and 0.04-, 0.15-, and 
0.41-micromol/L lower serum retinol. Serum ACT (g/L) was higher in women with
malaria than in those without (beta = 0.10; 0.03, 0.16) and in gravida 1 than in 
gravida > or =2 (beta = 0.012; 0.003, 0.021), but was not higher in HIV-infected 
women than in uninfected women (beta = 0.001; -0.008, 0.011).
CONCLUSIONS: HIV infection, malaria, gravidity, and gestational age were
predictors of serum beta-carotene and retinol. Serum ACT was an important
predictor of both and was associated with gravidity and gestational age.

Local-scale variation in malaria infection amongst rural Gambian children
estimated by satellite remote sensing.

We investigated local-scale variation in malaria transmission and infection in
children within a continuous landscape by retrospective spatial analysis of
entomological and clinical data collected during 1988 and 1989 in The Gambia,
West Africa. Parasite prevalence was negatively correlated with vector abundance 
and exposure to malaria parasites in 10 villages where entomological surveillance
had been carried out. Variation in bednet use did not explain this finding.
Mosquito-breeding habitat was retrospectively mapped using 20-m spatial
resolution multispectral SPOT satellite imagery from 1988. From these data we
estimated by linear regression the risk of exposure to malaria parasites in 26
villages where clinical surveys of children had been made. As exposure increased,
so did parasite prevalence; but at higher levels of exposure, parasite prevalence
declined. Our findings demonstrate marked differences in exposure to malaria in
villages over distances of less than 2 km from mosquito breeding sites and
suggest that there are also large differences in immunity between neighbouring
settlements.

Malaria control in an agro-industrial settlement of Rondônia (Western Amazon
region, Brazil).

A malaria control pilot project was developed in the Urupá agro-industrial farm
that is situated in the State of Rondônia (Western Amazon Region, Brazil). Around
180 inhabitants had been surveyed for the past five years. The control measures
were based on (1) training a community agent to perform on the spot microscopical
diagnosis of malaria and to treat the uncomplicated cases of malaria; (2)
limiting the use of insecticides to a short period before the high transmission
season. This resulted in a significant reduction in the time between the onset of
clinical symptoms and specific chemotherapy which fell from 3.5 to 1.3 days. In
relation to the previous three reference years the total number of malaria cases 
was reduced to 50% in the first year and to 25% in the second year. The
introduction of these measures coincided with pronounced reduction in the
frequency of Plasmodium falciparum infections but this was less marked for P.
vivax infections. In the second year of the pilot experiment there was no P.
falciparum transmission on the farm. During the last decade there was a general
decrease in the endemicity of malaria in the State of Rondônia. The linear
regression coefficient values indicate that the decline was more pronounced in
Urupá than in the general municipality and that the falciparum malaria API in
Urupá farm is significantly lower than in the general municipality of Candeias
were the farm is situated.

Nitric oxide, malaria, and anemia: inverse relationship between nitric oxide
production and hemoglobin concentration in asymptomatic, malaria-exposed
children.

Research, Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia.

The cause of the anemia associated with chronic, intermittent, asymptomatic,
low-level parasitemia in children in malaria-endemic endemic areas is not well
understood. Nitric oxide (NO) decreases erythropoiesis, and it is likely an
important mediator of anemia of chronic disease. Production of NO is decreased in
acute uncomplicated and cerebral malaria, but it is increased in asymptomatic
Tanzanian children (with or without parasitemia). We hypothesized that chronic
overproduction of NO in these asymptomatic children contributes to the anemia
associated with subclinical/subpatent malaria. In 44 fasting, asymptomatic,
malaria-exposed, Tanzanian children, NO production (measured using fasting urine 
NOx excretion) was inversely associated with hemoglobin concentration (P = 0.03, 
controlling for age and gender). Using multiple linear regression, hemoglobin
concentration was negatively associated with parasitemia (P = 0.005). After
controlling for age and parasitemia, NO was no longer an independent predictor of
anemia. One of the mechanisms of parasite-related anemia in such children may be 
through the adverse hematologic effects of parasite-induced NO production.

Geophagy, iron status and anaemia among pregnant women on the coast of Kenya.

Geissler PW(1), Shulman CE, Prince RJ, Mutemi W, Mnazi C, Friis H, Lowe B.

Author information: 
(1)Danish Bilharziasis Laboratory, Charlottenlund, Denmark. wg@bilharziasis.dk

In a cross sectional survey based in an antenatal clinic at Kilifi District
Hospital, Coast Province, Kenya, 154 of 275 pregnant women (56%) reported eating 
soil regularly. Geophagous women had lower haemoglobin and serum ferritin
concentrations than non-geophagous women (mean haemoglobin level 9.1 vs. 10.0
g/dL, P < 0.001; median ferritin level 4.5 vs. 9.0 micrograms/L, P < 0.001). In
multiple linear regression analyses, geophagy was a significant predictor of
haemoglobin (beta = -6.4, P = 0.01) and serum ferritin concentrations (beta =
-6.6, P = 0.002), while controlling for gestational age and malaria and hookworm 
infection. Another 38 pregnant women, who reported eating soil regularly,
participated in focus group discussions and were interviewed on geophagy. The
most commonly eaten soil was from the walls of houses. The median estimated daily
intake was 41.5 g (range 2.5-219.0 g). Twenty-seven of these women assisted in
the collection of soil samples which were then analysed for their content of
iron, zinc and aluminium after extraction with 0.1 M HC1. The average daily soil 
intake supplied the geophagous women with 4.3 mg of iron, corresponding to 14% of
the recommended dietary allowance of iron for pregnant women. The study revealed 
a strong negative association between geophagy and both haemoglobin and ferritin 
status. At the same time it demonstrated the potential of soil as a source of
dietary iron for geophagous women. These seemingly contradictory results might be
due to other components in the soil interfering with iron uptake or metabolism.
Alternatively, it may be that the geophagous women had extremely depleted iron
stores before starting to eat soil. From these cross-sectional data, no inference
about causality could be made.

An evaluation of the effects of intermittent sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine treatment 
in pregnancy on parasite clearance and risk of low birthweight in rural Malawi.

The prevalence of infection with malarial parasites and the incidence of anaemia 
and delivery of infants with low birthweight (LBW) were investigated in 575
Malawian mothers who received one, two or three doses of
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) during pregnancy. All the subjects were enrolled
at their first antenatal visit and all delivered at hospital. The prevalence of
Plasmodium falciparum infection at first antenatal visit was 35.3% in
primigravidae and 13.6% in multigravidae (P < 0.001). Mean haemoglobin
concentration was significantly lower in primigravidae than in multigravidae (8.8
v. 9.5 g/dl; P < 0.001). Of the 233 women tested for HIV infection, 18.8% of the 
primigravidae and 23.7% of the multigravidae were seropositive. At delivery,
there was no significant difference in parasite prevalence in peripheral or
placental blood between women who had received one or two antenatal doses of SP. 
The multigravidae who had received two doses of SP had higher mean haemoglobin
concentrations than those who had received just one (P = 0.009) [this difference 
was not seen in the primigravidae (P = 0.92)]. However, linear regression
analysis indicated that the haematinic supplements given to the subjects
contributed more to this increase in haemoglobin concentration than the SP. The
mean birthweights were higher, and incidence of LBW lower in babies born to
primi-and multi-gravidae who had received two or three doses of SP treatment than
those seen in babies born to women who had had just one dose (P < 0.03 for each).
The odds ratio for LBW in primigravidae compared with multigravidae decreased
from 3.2 to 1.0 as the number of SP doses increased from one to three. The
benefit of three doses (compared with none) was equivalent to the
population-attributable risk of LBW in primigravidae being reduced from 34.6% to 
0%. Subjects who were seropositive for HIV were twice as likely to give birth to 
LBW babies as the other subjects. The use of SP was not associated with maternal 
side-effects or perinatal complications. The present results indicate that
multiple doses of SP taken during pregnancy will lead to a highly significant
reduction in the incidence of LBW in infants born to primigravidae, even if the
women have HIV infections. This reduction is observable even when parasite
prevalence at delivery is high because of re-infections in late pregnancy;
reduction in parasite prevalence earlier in pregnancy, as the result of SP
treatment, leads to improved foetal growth.

PIP: The effect of antimalarial treatment followed by chemoprophylaxis during
pregnancy on low birth weight (LBW) and anemia was investigated in a study
conducted in Chikwawa District Hospital, Malawi, in 1993-94. The 575 women from
this malaria-endemic community who were enrolled at their first prenatal visit
and delivered at the Chikwawa Hospital were included in the data analysis; 24.3% 
were primigravidae. At enrollment, the prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum
infection was 35.3% in primigravidae and 13.6% in multigravidae. At delivery,
there was no significant difference in parasite prevalence between women who had 
received 1 or 2 antenatal doses of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP).
Multigravidae--but not primigravidae--who received 2 SP doses had higher mean
hemoglobin levels than those who received just 1 dose; however, linear regression
analysis indicated that hematinic supplements contributed more to this increase
than SP. The mean birth weights of infants born to primi- and multigravidae who
received 2 or more doses of SP were significantly higher than those of infants
whose mothers received only 1 dose. The odds ratio for LBW in primigravidae
compared with multigravidae decreased from 3.2 to 1.0 as the number of SP doses
increased from 1 to 3. The benefit of 3 doses compared with no treatment was
equivalent to the population-attributable risk of LBW in primigravidae being
reduced from 34.6% to 0. HIV-positive women (18.8% of primigravidae and 23.7% of 
multigravidae) were twice as likely to have LBW infants than HIV-negative women. 
The reduction in LBW deliveries was significant even when parasite prevalence at 
delivery was high as a result of reinfection in late pregnancy.

AIMS: To obtain comprehensive pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data for
artesunate (ARTS) and its active metabolite dihydroartemisinin (DHA) following
i.v. and oral administration of ARTS to patients with acute, uncomplicated
falciparum malaria.
METHODS: Twenty-six Vietnamese patients with falciparum malaria were randomized
to receive either i.v. ARTS (120 mg; group 1) or oral ARTS (100 mg; group 2),
with the alternative preparation given 8 h later in an open crossover design.
Mefloquine (750 mg) was administered at 24 h. Plasma concentrations of ARTS and
DHA were determined by h.p.l.c. assay. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated
by non-compartmental methods. The time to 50% parasite clearance (PCT50) was
calculated by linear interpolation of parasite density determinations. Linear
least squares and multiple linear regression analyses were used to evaluate
pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships.
RESULTS: Following i.v. bolus, ARTS had a peak concentration of 29.5 microM (11
mg l[-1]), elimination t1/2 = 2.7 min, CL = 2.33 l h(-1) kg(-1) and V = 0.14 l
kg(-1). The Cmax for DHA was 9.3 microM (2.64 mg l[-1]), t1/2 = 40 min, CL =0.75 
l h(-1) kg(-1) and V = 0.76 l kg(-1). Following oral ARTS, relative
bioavailability of DHA was 82%, Cmax was 2.6 microM (0.74 mg l[-1]), t1/2 = 39
min, and MAT = 67 min. Overall, the PCT50 and fever clearance time (FCT) were 6.5
h and 24 h, respectively. There was no correlation between PCT50 or FCT and AUC, 
Cmax or MRT for DHA.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite rapid clearance of ARTS and DHA in patients with
uncomplicated falciparum malaria, prompt parasite and fever clearance were
achieved. High relative bioavailability of DHA following oral ARTS
administration, and clinical outcomes comparable with those after i.v. ARTS,
support the use of the oral formulation in the primary care setting.

Dose- and time-dependent relations between infective Anopheles inoculation and
outcomes of Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia among children in western Kenya.

Blood-stage level Plasmodium falciparum infection (parasitemia density) is
generally elevated prior to, or at the time of, clinical presentation of severe
pediatric malaria episodes. Intensity of exposure to infective Anopheles mosquito
bites is a suspected determinant of higher density parasitemia. Analyses of
entomologic and parasitologic data collected in 1986-1987 were conducted to
investigate whether the dose of infective bites predicted the incidence or degree
of P. falciparum parasitemia in Kenyan children < 6 years old. At 21 consecutive 
30-day intervals, a new cohort (n approximately 50 each) was enrolled, cured of
malaria parasites, and monitored over 84 days for recurrent parasitemia. Outcomes
included time to parasitemia, time to parasitemia > or = 5,000/microliter, and
parasitemia density. Ecologic and individual-level analyses were conducted. The
mean infective bite exposure experienced by each cohort was significantly
associated with the incidence of parasitemia (age-adjusted r2 = 0.38, p = 0.022) 
and more strongly associated with the incidence of parasitemia > or =
5,000/microliter (age-adjusted r2 = 0.72, p < 0.001). The infective bite dose,
analyzed as a time-dependent covariate, was associated with a 2.8 times higher
rate of parasitemia > or = 5,000/microliter among children exposed to > or = 1
infective bite per day as compared with the referent (rate ratio (RR) = 2.82, 95%
confidence interval (CI) 2.24-3.56). Cumulative infective bite exposure, exposure
duration, and age were significant predictors of recurrent parasitemia density in
multiple linear regression analyses. The results support the contention that
reductions in P. falciparum transmission intensity, in the absence of complete
elimination, will reduce higher level parasitemia among African children.

PIP: Elevated numbers of asexual erythrocytic-stage Plasmodium falciparum
parasites in the peripheral blood circulation is a known risk factor of the
clinical severity of malaria episodes. The interrelationships among a continuum
of sporozoite dose, duration of exposure, age, level of parasitemia at
enrollment, village of residence, sex, and recurrent P. falciparum parasitemia
were investigated in a 2-year (1986-87) study of 862 children 6 months to 6 years
of age from six contiguous villages in Western Kenya. At 21 consecutive 30-day
intervals, a new cohort was enrolled, cured, and monitored over 84 days for
recurrent parasitemia. The mean cumulative dose was 23 inoculations, and there
was a significant linear correlation between this variable and the incidence rate
of first recurrent parasitemia, with even stronger associations for the incidence
of higher density parasitemia. The overall 70-day cumulative incidence of first
recurrent parasitemia was 88.5% (22.5% for high-density P. falciparum). The
infective bite dose, analyzed as a time-dependent covariate, was associated with 
a 2.8 times higher rate of parasitemia equal to or above 5000/mcl among children 
exposed to one or more bites per day compared to the referent. Each one unit
increase in the mean dose was associated with a 24% higher rate of recurrent
parasitemia and a 26% higher rate of recurrent high-density parasitemia after
adjustment for covariates. Multiple linear regression analyses indicated that
parasitemia density was significantly positively associated with cumulative dose 
and inversely associated with duration of exposure and age. Approximately 36% of 
the variance in malaria incidence rates was explained by the mean cumulative dose
of infective bites.

Statistical analysis of highly skewed immune response data.

This paper considers methods of statistical analysis for highly skewed immune
response data. Observations from population studies of immunological variables
are rarely normally distributed between individuals; typically the distribution
shows extreme levels of skewness. In some situations, skewness remains
considerable even after transforming the data. Using resampling techniques,
applied to several actual datasets of ELISA assay data, we consider the
robustness of normal parametric methods, e.g. t tests and linear regression.
Despite the skewness of the transformed data, we demonstrate that such methods
are quite robust depending on the number of observations, type of analysis and
severity of skewness. We also illustrate how bootstrap resampling can be used to 
provide a valid alternative method of analysis that can be used either for
checking normal parametric analysis or as a direct method of analysis. We
illustrate this combined approach by analysing real data to test for association 
between human serum antibodies to malaria merozoite surface proteins, MSP1 and
MSP2, and resistance to clinical malaria, and confirm the protective effect of
antibodies to MSP1 and demonstrated a similar protective effect for some
antibodies to MSP2.

Collaborating Center for Malaria, Schistosomiasis and Filariasis, Shanghai,
People's Republic of China.

Effect of different numbers of infecting Brugia malayi on the survival of
Anopheles sinensis were quantitatively studied in our laboratory. Four groups of 
healthy adult female mosquitos were tested. They were named G-0, G-1, G-2 and
G-3, in which the numbers of microfilariae (mf) infecting per mosquito were 0, 5,
10 and 50, respectively. The experimental infection was conducted by inoculating 
the mf into the bodies of mosquitos through the neck membrane with a
microinjector. It was observed that, in the groups from G-0 to G-3, the maximal
life-span postinoculation (PI) were 21, 21, 20 and 10 days, the average
life-spans PI were 7.78, 7.98, 7.05 and 3.55 days, and the survival time at 50%
mortality PI were 6.72, 6.80, 6.40 and 4.00 days, respectively. Daily survival
rates in the groups G-0, G-1 and G-2 declined slowly, over 25% on the 10th day
PI, whereas the one in the group G-3 dropped down quickly, to zero on the same
day. Linear regression analysis on the daily survival rates against the days PI
showed significant differences between the groups G-0 and G-3 (0.02 > p > 0.01), 
but no significant differences between the groups G-0 and G-1, or between G-0 and
G-2 (p > 0.5).

Innsburck, Austria.

Optimal nonlinear transformations provided by alternating conditional
expectations (ACE) method are used to study the relationship between electronic
structure and antimalarial activity of mefloquine and its substituted
derivatives. The electronic structure of these molecules is featured by atomic
net charges evaluated on the basis of CNDO/2 molecular orbital calculations. A
comparison to multiple linear regression (MLR) and partial least squares (PLS)
method is also included. The results show that ACE can be a useful and
well-suited technique for establishing QSAR and predicting the pharmacological
activity of compounds.

Chloroquine-phosphate was suspended in various lipophilic and hydrophilic
suppository bases in an amount of 250 mg/2.0 g. The authors studied the solidity 
and the disintegration time of the suppositories as well as the in vitro drug
liberation with a membrane diffusion method. The effect of the storage time and
the storage circumstances on the stability of the suppositories was observed.
Tropics-resistance studies were also carried out at a temperature of 45 degrees C
and at a relative humidity content of 75%, thus these suppositories may be used
for the treatment of malaria. The Witepsol H 15 base was found to be the best in 
all respect for use in countries with a continental climate. Finally a function
relationship was found between the concentration of the pharmacon and the
diffusion time with linear regression analysis.

A village-scale field trial of pyrethroid-impregnated mosquito nets was
undertaken in The Gambia, West Africa, in the Mandinka village of Saruja (13
degrees 13'N, 14 degrees 55'W) during July-November 1989. Nearly all the
villagers possessed and used their own bednets. Anopheles gambiae is the main
vector of human malaria in the area. An experimental wash-resistant formulation
of permethrin was compared with standard emulsifiable concentrate (EC)
formulations of permethrin and lambda-cyhalothrin, versus placebo-treated
bednets. Target concentrations of pyrethroids on bednets were permethrin 500
mg/m2 and lambda-cyhalothrin 25 mg/m2. The experimental design involved random
allocation of a treatment to one net per family. Whereas 68% of people questioned
said they washed their nets fortnightly, observations during the 16-week trial
period showed that only 4/130 (3%) of nets involved in the trial had been washed 
as frequently as once per month. Early morning searches for mosquitoes under
bednets (1 day/week for 16 weeks) found significantly more mosquitoes (60%
An.gambiae) in placebo-treated nets than in pyrethroid-treated nets. The numbers 
found with each of the three pyrethroid treatments did not differ significantly
from each other. Insecticidal efficacy of the treatments was tested by bioassays 
using wild-caught unfed mosquitoes exposed to netting for 3 min. Linear
regression analysis of bioassay mortality against number of times that a net had 
been washed by villagers showed that nets impregnated with the wash-resistant
permethrin retained their insecticidal properties better than nets impregnated
with lambda-cyhalothrin or with the standard permethrin formulation.

A landscape approach using remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS)
technologies was developed to discriminate between villages at high and low risk 
for malaria transmission, as defined by adult Anopheles albimanus abundance.
Satellite data for an area in southern Chiapas, Mexico were digitally processed
to generate a map of landscape elements. The GIS processes were used to determine
the proportion of mapped landscape elements surrounding 40 villages where An.
albimanus abundance data had been collected. The relationships between vector
abundance and landscape element proportions were investigated using stepwise
discriminant analysis and stepwise linear regression. Both analyses indicated
that the most important landscape elements in terms of explaining vector
abundance were transitional swamp and unmanaged pasture. Discriminant functions
generated for these two elements were able to correctly distinguish between
villages with high and low vector abundance, with an overall accuracy of 90%.
Regression results found both transitional swamp and unmanaged pasture
proportions to be predictive of vector abundance during the mid-to-late wet
season. This approach, which integrates remotely sensed data and GIS capabilities
to identify villages with high vector-human contact risk, provides a promising
tool for malaria surveillance programs that depend on labor-intensive field
techniques. This is particularly relevant in areas where the lack of accurate
surveillance capabilities may result in no malaria control action when, in fact, 
directed action is necessary. In general, this landscape approach could be
applied to other vector-borne diseases in areas where 1) the landscape elements
critical to vector survival are known and 2) these elements can be detected at
remote sensing scales.

Measures of capillary permeability in acute falciparum malaria: relation to
severity of infection and treatment.

Capillary permeability was investigated in 32 Thai patients aged 14-49 years who 
had acute falciparum malaria with use of three distinct techniques: quantitation 
of the urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR), estimation of the transcapillary
escape rate of radiolabeled albumin (TER), and retinal photography/fluorescein
angiography. Fourteen patients had uncomplicated infections and 18 were severe
cases. The severely ill patients had significantly higher ACRs (median, 4.8
mg/mmol; 95% confidence limits, 2.4-19.9 mg/mmol) and TERs (median, 8.3%/h; 95%
confidence limits, 6.2-13.2%/h) than the uncomplicated cases (ACR: median, 2.1
mg/mmol; 95% confidence limits, 6.2-13.2%/h) than the uncomplicated cases (ACR:
median, 2.1 mg/mmol; 95% confidence limits, 1.0-8.8 mg/mmol; TER: median, 5.9%/h;
95% confidence limits, 3.8-10.6%/h; P = .014 and .042). Both variables were
significantly associated with biochemical indices of disease severity including
total serum bilirubin levels (rs greater than or equal to 0.398, P less than .025
in each case), but there were no significant differences between ACRs and TERs
among comatose and noncomatose patients with severe infections (P greater than or
equal to .08). Retinopathy (hemorrhages, cotton-wool spots, capillary
nonperfusion, and/or extravasation of fluorescein) was found in eight severely
ill patients and in two uncomplicated cases. Fluorescein leakage was evident in
six patients. Although fluorescein leakage had the strongest parametric
correlation with the presence of coma relative to both ACR and TER in the full
patient series (r = 0.58, P less than .01), multiple linear regression analysis
indicated that concentrations of plasma lactate (t = 2.998, P = .006) and serum
creatinine (t = 2.200, P = .036) were the factors responsible for this
association. These data do not support a role for tissue edema in the
pathogenesis of cerebral malaria but reveal an association between markers of
disease severity and a generalized increase in systemic capillary permeability.

Comparison on the performance of Leishmania major-like and Leishmania
braziliensis braziliensis as antigen for New World leishmaniasis
IgG-immunofluorescence test.

Paulo, Brazil.

The performance of an antigen of L. major-like promastigotes for the serological 
diagnosis of mucocutaneous leishmaniasis in the IgG-immunofluorescent test was
compared to that of an antigen of L.braziliensis braziliensis. Each antigen was
used to test two hundred and twenty-four sera of etiologies such as mucocutaneous
leishmaniasis, deep mycoses, toxoplasmosis, malaria. Chagas' disease, visceral
leishmaniasis, anti-nuclear factor, schistosomiasis, rheumatoid factor and normal
controls. Agreement between responses to each antigen was high: 77.2% of
leishmaniases sera agreed on a positive or a negative result to both antigens and
91.1% of control sera. Cross reactivity was restricted to Chagas' disease sera,
visceral leishmaniasis, anti-nuclear factor and paracoccidioidomycosis. The
quantitative response of leishmaniasis and Chagas' disease sera to both antigens 
was evaluated by a linear regression; although the y-intercept and the slope were
different for each antigen, neither was better than the other in the disclosure
of anti-Leishmania antibodies. In the case of Chagas' disease sera the
L.major-like antigen was better than L.b.braziliensis' to disclose cross-reacting
antibodies.

To investigate the relation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) to
Plasmodium falciparum infection, plasma TNF alpha concentrations were measured in
Zairian children with severe malaria, mild malaria, or other illnesses. The
initial geometric mean plasma concentration of TNF alpha among 61 children with
P. falciparum infection, (71 pg/ml) was higher than the level in 26 severely ill,
aparasitemic children (10 pg/ml; P less than .001). Among 29 parasitemic
children, initial geometric mean TNF alpha levels decreased from 77 to 5 pg/ml (P
less than .001) at day 7. TNF alpha levels increased with parasite density and
were associated with hyperparasitemia, severe anemia, hypoglycemia, and young age
but not with cerebral malaria or fatal outcome. However, TNF alpha levels were
elevated equally in children with cerebral malaria and with other signs of severe
malaria. With multiple linear regression, TNF alpha levels were elevated
independently in children with hyperparasitemia (P = .001) and severe anemia (P =
.04). In this study, high TNF alpha levels were associated with several
manifestations of severe malaria and were not specific to cerebral malaria.

In vitro susceptibility of Plasmodium falciparum malaria to pyrimethamine,
sulfadoxine, trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole, singly and in combination.

Petersen E.

Two isolates of Plasmodium falciparum (F 32 and K 1) were tested against
sulfadoxine (SDX), sulfamethoxazole (SMZ), pyrimethamine (PYR) and trimethoprim
(TMP), using a 48 h microtest, with RPMI-1640 low in PABA and folic acid. The
IC50 for F 32 was: PYR 6.1 X 10(-9) M (mol/litre), TMP 1.3 X 10(-7) M, Fansidar
(SDX/PYR 80:1) less than 10(-8) to 1.3 X 10(-10) M and cotrimoxazole (SMZ/TMP
20:1) 2.6 X 10(-7) to 1.3 X 10(-8) M. The IC50 for K 1 was: PYR greater than
10(-6) M, TMP 8.2 X 10(-7) M, Fansidar 4.1 X 10(-7) to 1.1 X 10(-9) M and
cotrimoxazole 1.8 X 10(-6) to 9.0 X 10(-8) M. The difference in IC50 between F 32
and K 1 against TMP and cotrimoxazole is much less than the difference between
the IC50 values against PYR and Fansidar, indicating that cross-resistance
between PYR and TMP exists, but is not complete. A method for calculating the
IC50 by linear regression analysis is described.

Human serum proteins indicative for the nutritional status and serum proteinase
inhibitors in uncomplicated falciparum malaria.

Schelp FP, Harinasuta T, Bunnag D, Böhning D, Supawan V, Deininger S, Pongpaew P.

The serum proteins supposed to be indicative of the nutritional status, albumin, 
prealbumin and transferrin, as well as the serum proteinase inhibitors alpha
1-protease inhibitor (alpha 1-antichymotrypsin (Ach) and alpha 2-macroglobulin
(alpha 2M) were measured in 14 Thai males suffering from uncomplicated falciparum
malaria on the day of admission and after treatment with mefloquin on the 2nd,
28th and 63rd day. The same serum proteins had been determined from 31 healthy
Thai males. Upon admission albumin and prealbumin concentrations had been lower
and Ach higher in malaria patients compared with healthy Thai males. A
significantly higher alpha 1 PI value was observed on the day of admission
compared with the 28th day of the malaria patients. Only on the day of admission 
and only for the patients was a statistically significant negative linear
regression found for albumin and prealbumin with Ach and a positive correlation
for prealbumin with alpha 2 M as well as for albumin and transferrin correlated
with alpha 1 PI. In well-nourished malaria patients the synthesis of the "acute
phase reactants", alpha 1 PI and Ach, might be enhanced and in a reverse
relationship the synthesis of albumin, pre-albumin and transferrin depressed.
