The complex transmission ecologies of vector-borne and zoonotic diseases pose
challenges to their control, especially in changing landscapes. Human incidence
of zoonotic malaria ( Plasmodium knowlesi) is associated with deforestation
although mechanisms are unknown. Here, a novel application of a method for
predicting disease occurrence that combines machine learning and statistics is
used to identify the key spatial scales that define the relationship between
zoonotic malaria cases and environmental change. Using data from satellite
imagery, a case-control study, and a cross-sectional survey, predictive models of
household-level occurrence of P. knowlesi were fitted with 16 variables
summarized at 11 spatial scales simultaneously. The method identified a strong
and well-defined peak of predictive influence of the proportion of cleared land
within 1 km of households on P. knowlesi occurrence. Aspect (1 and 2 km), slope
(0.5 km) and canopy regrowth (0.5 km) were important at small scales. By
contrast, fragmentation of deforested areas influenced P. knowlesi occurrence
probability most strongly at large scales (4 and 5 km). The identification of
these spatial scales narrows the field of plausible mechanisms that connect land 
use change and P. knowlesi, allowing for the refinement of disease occurrence
predictions and the design of spatially-targeted interventions.

Disparate types of data including biological and environmental have been used in 
supervised learning to predict a specific disease outcome. However, social
determinants of health, which have been explored very little, promise to be
signiﬁcant predictors of public health problems such as malaria and anemia among 
children. We considered studying their contribution power in malaria and anemia
predictions based on Variable Importance in Projection (VIP). This innovative
method has potential advantages as it analyzes the impact of independent
variables on disease prediction. In addition, we applied ﬁve machine learning
algorithms to classify both diseases, using social determinants of health data,
and compared their results. Of them all, artiﬁcial neural networks gave the best 
results of 94.74% and 84.17% accuracy for malaria and anemia prediction,
respectively. These results are consistent and reﬂect the signiﬁcance of
non-medical factors in disease prediction.

Despite the remarkable progress that has been made to reduce global malaria
mortality by 29% in the past 5 years, malaria is still a serious global health
problem. Inadequate diagnostics is one of the major obstacles in fighting the
disease. An automated system for malaria diagnosis can help to make malaria
screening faster and more reliable. We present an automated system to detect and 
segment red blood cells (RBCs) and identify infected cells in Wright-Giemsa
stained thin blood smears. Specifically, using image analysis and machine
learning techniques, we process digital images of thin blood smears to determine 
the parasitemia in each smear. We use a cell extraction method to segment RBCs,
in particular overlapping cells. We show that a combination of RGB color and
texture features outperforms other features. We evaluate our method on
microscopic blood smear images from human and mouse and show that it outperforms 
other techniques. For human cells, we measure an absolute error of 1.18% between 
the true and the automatic parasite counts. For mouse cells, our automatic counts
correlate well with expert and flow cytometry counts. This makes our system the
first one to work for both human and mouse.

Technology, Jadavpur University, Kolkata 700032. India.

Tuberculosis, malaria, dengue, chikungunya, leishmaniasis etc. are a large group 
of neglected tropical diseases that prevail in tropical and subtropical
countries, affecting one billion people every year. Minimal funding and grants
for research on these scientific problems challenge many researcher to find a
different way to reduce the extensive time and cost involved in the drug
discovery cycle of these problems. Computer-aided drug design techniques have
already been proved successful in discovery of new molecules rationally by
reducing the time and cost involved in the development of drugs. In the current
minireview, we are highlighting on the molecular modeling studies published
during 2010-2018 for target specific antitubercular agents. This review includes 
the studies of structure-based (SB) and ligand-based (LB) studies and those
involving machine learning (ML) techniques against different antitubercular
targets such as dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), enoyl acyl carrier protein (ACP) 
reductase (InhA), catalase-peroxidase (KatG), enzyme antigen 85C, protein
tyrosine phosphatases (PtpA and PtpB), dUTPase, thioredoxin reductase (MtTrxR),
etc. The information presented in this review will help the researchers to get
acquainted with the recent progress in the modeling studies of antitubercular
agents.

The objective of this study was to test statistical features from the
electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings as predictors of neurodevelopment and
cognition of Ugandan children after coma due to cerebral malaria. The increments 
of the frequency bands of EEG time series were modeled as Student processes; the 
parameters of these Student processes were estimated and used along with clinical
and demographic data in a machine-learning algorithm for the prediction of
children's neurodevelopmental and cognitive scores 6 months after cerebral
malaria illness. The key innovation of this work is in the identification of
stochastic EEG features that can serve as language-independent markers of the
impact of cerebral malaria on the developing brain. The results can enhance
prognostic determination of which children are in most need of rehabilitative
interventions, which is especially important in resource-constrained settings
such as sub-Saharan Africa.

Drug repurposing is a valuable tool for combating the slowing rates of novel
therapeutic discovery. The Computational Analysis of Novel Drug Opportunities
(CANDO) platform performs shotgun repurposing of 2030 indications/diseases using 
3733 drugs/compounds to predict interactions with 46,784 proteins and relating
them via proteomic interaction signatures. The accuracy is calculated by
comparing interaction similarities of drugs approved for the same indications. We
performed a unique subset analysis by breaking down the full protein library into
smaller subsets and then recombining the best performing subsets into larger
supersets. Up to 14% improvement in accuracy is seen upon benchmarking the
supersets, representing a 100⁻1000-fold reduction in the number of proteins
considered relative to the full library. Further analysis revealed that libraries
comprised of proteins with more equitably diverse ligand interactions are
important for describing compound behavior. Using one of these libraries to
generate putative drug candidates against malaria, tuberculosis, and large cell
carcinoma results in more drugs that could be validated in the biomedical
literature compared to using those suggested by the full protein library. Our
work elucidates the role of particular protein subsets and corresponding ligand
interactions that play a role in drug repurposing, with implications for drug
design and machine learning approaches to improve the CANDO platform.

Visual inspection for the quantification of malaria parasitaemiain (MP) and
classification of life cycle stage are hard and time taking. Even though,
automated techniques for the quantification of MP and their classification are
reported in the literature. However, either reported techniques are imperfect or 
cannot deal with special issues such as anemia and hemoglobinopathies due to
clumps of red blood cells (RBCs). The focus of the current work is to examine the
thin blood smear microscopic images stained with Giemsa by digital image
processing techniques, grading MP on independent factors (RBCs morphology) and
classification of its life cycle stage. For the classification of the life cycle 
of malaria parasite the k-nearest neighbor, Naïve Bayes and multi-class support
vector machine are employed for classification based on histograms of oriented
gradients and local binary pattern features. The proposed methodology is based on
inductive technique, segment malaria parasites through the adaptive machine
learning techniques. The quantification accuracy of RBCs is enhanced; RBCs clumps
are split by analysis of concavity regions for focal points. Further,
classification of infected and non-infected RBCs has been made to grade MP
precisely. The training and testing of the proposed approach on benchmark dataset
with respect to ground truth data, yield 96.75% MP sensitivity and 94.59%
specificity. Additionally, the proposed approach addresses the process with
independent factors (RBCs morphology). Finally, it is an economical solution for 
MP grading in immense testing.

Adjuvants have long been critical components of vaccines, but the exact
mechanisms of their action and precisely how they alter or enhance
vaccine-induced immune responses are often unclear. In this study, we used broad 
immunoprofiling of antibody, cellular, and cytokine responses, combined with data
integration and machine learning to gain insight into the impact of different
adjuvant formulations on vaccine-induced immune responses. A Self-Assembling
Protein Nanoparticles (SAPN) presenting the malarial circumsporozoite protein
(CSP) was used as a model vaccine, adjuvanted with three different liposomal
formulations: liposome plus Alum (ALFA), liposome plus QS21 (ALFQ), and both
(ALFQA). Using a computational approach to integrate the immunoprofiling data, we
identified distinct vaccine-induced immune responses and developed a multivariate
model that could predict the adjuvant condition from immune response data alone
with 92% accuracy (p = 0.003). The data integration also revealed that commonly
used readouts (i.e. serology, frequency of T cells producing IFN-γ, IL2, TNFα)
missed important differences between adjuvants. In summary, broad
immune-profiling in combination with machine learning methods enabled the
reliable and clear definition of immune signatures for different adjuvant
formulations, providing a means for quantitatively characterizing the complex
roles that adjuvants can play in vaccine-induced immunity. The approach described
here provides a powerful tool for identifying potential immune correlates of
protection, a prerequisite for the rational pairing of vaccines candidates and
adjuvants.

BACKGROUND: The RTS,S/AS01E vaccine provides partial protection against malaria
in African children, but immune responses have only been partially characterized 
and do not reliably predict protective efficacy. We aimed to evaluate
comprehensively the immunogenicity of the vaccine at peak response, the factors
affecting it, and the antibodies associated with protection against clinical
malaria in young African children participating in the multicenter phase 3 trial 
for licensure.
METHODS: We measured total IgM, IgG, and IgG1-4 subclass antibodies to three
constructs of the Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (CSP) and
hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) that are part of the RTS,S vaccine, by
quantitative suspension array technology. Plasma and serum samples were analyzed 
in 195 infants and children from two sites in Ghana (Kintampo) and Mozambique
(Manhiça) with different transmission intensities using a case-control study
design. We applied regression models and machine learning techniques to analyze
immunogenicity, correlates of protection, and factors affecting them.
RESULTS: RTS,S/AS01E induced IgM and IgG, predominantly IgG1 and IgG3, but also
IgG2 and IgG4, subclass responses. Age, site, previous malaria episodes, and
baseline characteristics including antibodies to CSP and other antigens
reflecting malaria exposure and maternal IgGs, nutritional status, and hemoglobin
concentration, significantly affected vaccine immunogenicity. We identified
distinct signatures of malaria protection and risk in RTS,S/AS01E but not in
comparator vaccinees. IgG2 and IgG4 responses to RTS,S antigens post-vaccination,
and anti-CSP and anti-P. falciparum antibody levels pre-vaccination, were
associated with malaria risk over 1-year follow-up. In contrast, antibody
responses to HBsAg (all isotypes, subclasses, and timepoints) and
post-vaccination IgG1 and IgG3 to CSP C-terminus and NANP were associated with
protection. Age and site affected the relative contribution of responses in the
correlates identified.
CONCLUSIONS: Cytophilic IgG responses to the C-terminal and NANP repeat regions
of CSP and anti-HBsAg antibodies induced by RTS,S/AS01E vaccination were
associated with malaria protection. In contrast, higher malaria exposure at
baseline and non-cytophilic IgG responses to CSP were associated with disease
risk. Data provide new correlates of vaccine success and failure in African
children and reveal key insights into the mode of action that can guide
development of more efficacious next-generation vaccines.

The parasite Plasmodium falciparum is the most lethal species of Plasmodium to
cause serious malaria infection in humans, and with resistance developing rapidly
novel treatment modalities are currently being sought, one of which being
combinations of existing compounds. The discovery of combinations of antimalarial
drugs that act synergistically with one another is hence of great importance;
however an exhaustive experimental screen of large drug space in a pairwise
manner is not an option. In this study we apply our machine learning approach,
Combination Synergy Estimation (CoSynE), which can predict novel synergistic drug
interactions using only prior experimental combination screening data and
knowledge of compound molecular structures, to a dataset of 1,540 antimalarial
drug combinations in which 22.2% were synergistic. Cross validation of our model 
showed that synergistic CoSynE predictions are enriched 2.74 × compared to random
selection when both compounds in a predicted combination are known from other
combinations among the training data, 2.36 × when only one compound is known from
the training data, and 1.5 × for entirely novel combinations. We prospectively
validated our model by making predictions for 185 combinations of 23 entirely
novel compounds. CoSynE predicted 20 combinations to be synergistic, which was
experimentally validated for nine of them (45%), corresponding to an enrichment
of 1.70 × compared to random selection from this prospective data set. Such
enrichment corresponds to a 41% reduction in experimental effort. Interestingly, 
we found that pairwise screening of the compounds CoSynE individually predicted
to be synergistic would result in an enrichment of 1.36 × compared to random
selection, indicating that synergy among compound combinations is not a random
event. The nine novel and correctly predicted synergistic compound combinations
mainly (where sufficient bioactivity information is available) consist of efflux 
or transporter inhibitors (such as hydroxyzine), combined with compounds
exhibiting antimalarial activity alone (such as sorafenib, apicidin, or
dihydroergotamine). However, not all compound synergies could be rationalized
easily in this way. Overall, this study highlights the potential for predictive
modeling to expedite the discovery of novel drug combinations in fight against
antimalarial resistance, while the underlying approach is also generally
applicable.

BACKGROUND: Microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained blood films remains a major
form of diagnosis in malaria case management, and is a reference standard for
research. However, as with other visualization-based diagnoses, accuracy depends 
on individual technician performance, making standardization difficult and
reliability poor. Automated image recognition based on machine-learning,
utilizing convolutional neural networks, offers potential to overcome these
drawbacks. A prototype digital microscope device employing an algorithm based on 
machine-learning, the Autoscope, was assessed for its potential in malaria
microscopy. Autoscope was tested in the Iquitos region of Peru in 2016 at two
peripheral health facilities, with routine microscopy and PCR as reference
standards. The main outcome measures include sensitivity and specificity of
diagnosis of malaria from Giemsa-stained blood films, using PCR as reference.
METHODS: A cross-sectional, observational trial was conducted at two peripheral
primary health facilities in Peru. 700 participants were enrolled with the
criteria: (1) age between 5 and 75 years, (2) history of fever in the last 3 days
or elevated temperature on admission, (3) informed consent. The main outcome
measures included sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis of malaria from
Giemsa-stained blood films, using PCR as reference.
RESULTS: At the San Juan clinic, sensitivity of Autoscope for diagnosing malaria 
was 72% (95% CI 64-80%), and specificity was 85% (95% CI 79-90%). Microscopy
performance was similar to Autoscope, with sensitivity 68% (95% CI 59-76%) and
specificity 100% (95% CI 98-100%). At San Juan, 85% of prepared slides had a
minimum of 600 WBCs imaged, thus meeting Autoscope's design assumptions. At the
second clinic, Santa Clara, the sensitivity of Autoscope was 52% (95% CI 44-60%) 
and specificity was 70% (95% CI 64-76%). Microscopy performance at Santa Clara
was 42% (95% CI 34-51) and specificity was 97% (95% CI 94-99). Only 39% of slides
from Santa Clara met Autoscope's design assumptions regarding WBCs imaged.
CONCLUSIONS: Autoscope's diagnostic performance was on par with routine
microscopy when slides had adequate blood volume to meet its design assumptions, 
as represented by results from the San Juan clinic. Autoscope's diagnostic
performance was poorer than routine microscopy on slides from the Santa Clara
clinic, which generated slides with lower blood volumes. Results of the study
reflect both the potential for artificial intelligence to perform tasks currently
conducted by highly-trained experts, and the challenges of replicating the
adaptiveness of human thought processes.

Having accurate maps depicting the locations of residential buildings across a
region benefits a range of sectors. This is particularly true for public health
programs focused on delivering services at the household level, such as indoor
residual spraying with insecticide to help prevent malaria. While open source
data from OpenStreetMap (OSM) depicting the locations and shapes of buildings is 
rapidly improving in terms of quality and completeness globally, even in settings
where all buildings have been mapped, information on whether these buildings are 
residential, commercial or another type is often only available for a small
subset. Using OSM building data from Botswana and Swaziland, we identified
buildings for which 'type' was indicated, generated via on the ground
observations, and classified these into two classes, "sprayable" and
"not-sprayable". Ensemble machine learning, using building characteristics such
as size, shape and proximity to neighbouring features, was then used to form a
model to predict which of these 2 classes every building in these two countries
fell into. Results show that an ensemble machine learning approach performed
marginally, but statistically, better than the best individual model and that
using this ensemble model we were able to correctly classify >86% (using
independent test data) of structures correctly as sprayable and not-sprayable
across both countries.

Malaria parasites (Plasmodium spp.) and related apicomplexan pathogens contain a 
nonphotosynthetic plastid called the apicoplast. Derived from an unusual
secondary eukaryote-eukaryote endosymbiosis, the apicoplast is a fascinating
organelle whose function and biogenesis rely on a complex amalgamation of
bacterial and algal pathways. Because these pathways are distinct from the human 
host, the apicoplast is an excellent source of novel antimalarial targets.
Despite its biomedical importance and evolutionary significance, the absence of a
reliable apicoplast proteome has limited most studies to the handful of pathways 
identified by homology to bacteria or primary chloroplasts, precluding our
ability to study the most novel apicoplast pathways. Here, we combine proximity
biotinylation-based proteomics (BioID) and a new machine learning algorithm to
generate a high-confidence apicoplast proteome consisting of 346 proteins.
Critically, the high accuracy of this proteome significantly outperforms previous
prediction-based methods and extends beyond other BioID studies of unique
parasite compartments. Half of identified proteins have unknown function, and 77%
are predicted to be important for normal blood-stage growth. We validate the
apicoplast localization of a subset of novel proteins and show that an
ATP-binding cassette protein ABCF1 is essential for blood-stage survival and
plays a previously unknown role in apicoplast biogenesis. These findings indicate
critical organellar functions for newly discovered apicoplast proteins. The
apicoplast proteome will be an important resource for elucidating unique pathways
derived from secondary endosymbiosis and prioritizing antimalarial drug targets.

This study is concerned with identifying features of 4-aminoquinoline scaffolds
that can help pinpoint characteristics that enhance activity against
chloroquine-resistant parasites. Statistically valid predictive models are
reported for a series of 4-aminoquinoline analogues that are active against
chloroquine-sensitive (NF54) and chloroquine-resistant (K1) strains of Plasmodium
falciparum. Quantitative structure activity relationship techniques, based on
statistical and machine learning methods such as multiple linear regression and
partial least squares, were used with a novel pruning method for the selection of
descriptors to develop robust models for both strains. Inspection of the dominant
descriptors supports the hypothesis that chemical features that enable
accumulation in the food vacuole of the parasite are key determinants of activity
against both strains. The hydrophilic properties of the compounds were found to
be crucial in predicting activity against the chloroquine-sensitive NF54 parasite
strain, but not in the case of the chloroquine-resistant K1 strain, in line with 
previous studies. Additionally, the models suggest that 'softer' compounds tend
to have improved activity for both strains than do 'harder' ones. The internally 
and externally validated models reported here should also prove useful in the
future screening of potential antimalarial compounds for targeting
chloroquine-resistant strains. Graphical Abstract Predictive models reveal linear
relationships for activity of 4-aminoquinoline analogues active against
chloroquine-sensitive strains of Plasmodium falciparum.

BACKGROUND: Asymptomatic Plasmodium infections are characterized by the absence
of clinical disease and the ability to restrict parasite replication. Increasing 
levels of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in Plasmodium falciparum infections have
been associated with the risk of developing clinical disease, suggesting that
individuals with asymptomatic infections may have reduced Treg frequency.
However, the relationship between Tregs, cellular activation and parasite control
in asymptomatic malaria remains unclear.
METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, the levels of Tregs and other T cell
activation phenotypes were compared using flow cytometry in symptomatic,
asymptomatic and uninfected children before and after stimulation with infected
red blood cell lysates (iRBCs). In addition, the association between these T cell
phenotypes and parasitaemia were investigated.
RESULTS: In children with asymptomatic infections, levels of Tregs and activated 
T cells were comparable to those in healthy controls but significantly lower than
those in symptomatic children. After iRBC stimulation, levels of Tregs remained
lower for asymptomatic versus symptomatic children. In contrast, levels of
activated T cells were higher for asymptomatic children. Strikingly, the
pre-stimulation levels of two T cell activation phenotypes (CD8+CD69+ and
CD8+CD25+CD69+) and the post-stimulation levels of two regulatory phenotypes
(CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ and CD8+CD25+Foxp3+) were significantly positively correlated
with and explained 68% of the individual variation in parasitaemia. A
machine-learning model based on levels of these four phenotypes accurately
distinguished between asymptomatic and symptomatic children (sensitivity = 86%,
specificity = 94%), suggesting that these phenotypes govern the observed
variation in disease status.
CONCLUSION: Compared to symptomatic P. falciparum infections, in children
asymptomatic infections are characterized by lower levels of Tregs and activated 
T cells, which are associated with lower parasitaemia. The results indicate that 
T cell regulatory and activation phenotypes govern both parasitaemia and disease 
status in paediatric malaria in the studied sub-Saharan African population.

Genome-wide analysis of transcription in the malaria parasite Plasmodium
falciparum has revealed robust variation in steady-state mRNA abundance
throughout the 48-h intraerythrocytic developmental cycle (IDC), suggesting that 
this process is highly dynamic and tightly regulated. Here, we utilize rapid
4-thiouracil (4-TU) incorporation via pyrimidine salvage to specifically label,
capture, and quantify newly-synthesized RNA transcripts at every hour throughout 
the IDC. This high-resolution global analysis of the transcriptome captures the
timing and rate of transcription for each newly synthesized mRNA in vivo,
revealing active transcription throughout all IDC stages. Using a statistical
model to predict the mRNA dynamics contributing to the total mRNA abundance at
each timepoint, we find varying degrees of transcription and stabilization for
each mRNA corresponding to developmental transitions. Finally, our results
provide new insight into co-regulation of mRNAs throughout the IDC through
regulatory DNA sequence motifs, thereby expanding our understanding of P.
falciparum mRNA dynamics.

BACKGROUND: The proportion of mosquitoes infected with malaria is an important
entomological metric used to assess the intensity of transmission and the impact 
of vector control interventions. Currently, the prevalence of mosquitoes with
salivary gland sporozoites is estimated by dissecting mosquitoes under a
microscope or using molecular methods. These techniques are laborious,
subjective, and require either expensive equipment or training. This study
evaluates the potential of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to identify
laboratory reared mosquitoes infected with rodent malaria.
METHODS: Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes were reared in the laboratory and fed on 
Plasmodium berghei infected blood. After 12 and 21 days post-feeding mosquitoes
were killed, scanned and analysed using NIRS and immediately dissected by
microscopy to determine the number of oocysts on the midgut wall or sporozoites
in the salivary glands. A predictive classification model was used to determine
parasite prevalence and intensity status from spectra.
RESULTS: The predictive model correctly classifies infectious and uninfectious
mosquitoes with an overall accuracy of 72%. The false negative and false positive
rates were 30 and 26%, respectively. While NIRS was able to differentiate between
uninfectious and highly infectious mosquitoes, differentiating between mid-range 
infectious groups was less accurate. Multiple scans of the same specimen, with
repositioning the mosquito between scans, is shown to improve accuracy. On a
smaller dataset NIRS was unable to predict whether mosquitoes harboured oocysts.
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, we provide the first evidence that NIRS can
differentiate between infectious and uninfectious mosquitoes. Currently,
distinguishing between different intensities of infection is challenging. The
classification model provides a flexible framework and allows for different error
rates to be optimised, enabling the sensitivity and specificity of the technique 
to be varied according to requirements.

Malaria remains among the world's deadliest diseases, and control efforts depend 
critically on the availability of effective diagnostic tools, particularly for
the identification of asymptomatic infections, which play a key role in disease
persistence and may account for most instances of transmission but often evade
detection by current screening methods. Research on humans and in animal models
has shown that infection by malaria parasites elicits changes in host odors that 
influence vector attraction, suggesting that such changes might yield robust
biomarkers of infection status. Here we present findings based on extensive
collections of skin volatiles from human populations with high rates of malaria
infection in Kenya. We report broad and consistent effects of malaria infection
on human volatile profiles, as well as significant divergence in the effects of
symptomatic and asymptomatic infections. Furthermore, predictive models based on 
machine learning algorithms reliably determined infection status based on
volatile biomarkers. Critically, our models identified asymptomatic infections
with 100% sensitivity, even in the case of low-level infections not detectable by
microscopy, far exceeding the performance of currently available rapid diagnostic
tests in this regard. We also identified a set of individual compounds that
emerged as consistently important predictors of infection status. These findings 
suggest that volatile biomarkers may have significant potential for the
development of a robust, noninvasive screening method for detecting malaria
infections under field conditions.

This paper presents the effort of collecting and curating a data set of 15461
molecules tested against the malaria parasite, with robust activity and mode of
action annotations. The set is compiled from in-house experimental data and the
public ChEMBL database subsets. We illustrate the usefulness of the dataset by
building QSAR models for antimalarial activity and QSPR models for modes of
actions, as well as by the analysis of the chemical space with the Generative
Topographic Mapping method. The GTM models perform well in prediction of both
activity and mode of actions, on par with the classical SVM methods. The
visualization of obtained maps helps to understand the distribution of molecules 
corresponding to different modes of action: molecules with similar targets are
located close to each other on the map. Therefore, this analysis may suggest new 
modes of action for non-annotated or even annotated compounds. In perspective,
this can be used as a tool for prediction of both antimalarial activity and
target for novel, untested compounds.

Malaria is a blood disease caused by the Plasmodium parasites transmitted through
the bite of female Anopheles mosquito. Microscopists commonly examine thick and
thin blood smears to diagnose disease and compute parasitemia. However, their
accuracy depends on smear quality and expertise in classifying and counting
parasitized and uninfected cells. Such an examination could be arduous for
large-scale diagnoses resulting in poor quality. State-of-the-art image-analysis 
based computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) methods using machine learning (ML)
techniques, applied to microscopic images of the smears using hand-engineered
features demand expertise in analyzing morphological, textural, and positional
variations of the region of interest (ROI). In contrast, Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNN), a class of deep learning (DL) models promise highly scalable and 
superior results with end-to-end feature extraction and classification. Automated
malaria screening using DL techniques could, therefore, serve as an effective
diagnostic aid. In this study, we evaluate the performance of pre-trained CNN
based DL models as feature extractors toward classifying parasitized and
uninfected cells to aid in improved disease screening. We experimentally
determine the optimal model layers for feature extraction from the underlying
data. Statistical validation of the results demonstrates the use of pre-trained
CNNs as a promising tool for feature extraction for this purpose.

Accurate and immediate diagnosis of malaria is important for medication of the
infectious disease. Conventional methods for diagnosing malaria are time
consuming and rely on the skill of experts. Therefore, an automatic and simple
diagnostic modality is essential for healthcare in developing countries that lack
the expertise of trained microscopists. In the present study, a new automatic
sensing method using digital in-line holographic microscopy (DIHM) combined with 
machine learning algorithms was proposed to sensitively detect unstained
malaria-infected red blood cells (iRBCs). To identify the RBC characteristics, 13
descriptors were extracted from segmented holograms of individual RBCs. Among the
13 descriptors, 10 features were highly statistically different between healthy
RBCs (hRBCs) and iRBCs. Six machine learning algorithms were applied to
effectively combine the dominant features and to greatly improve the diagnostic
capacity of the present method. Among the classification models trained by the 6 
tested algorithms, the model trained by the support vector machine (SVM) showed
the best accuracy in separating hRBCs and iRBCs for training (n = 280, 96.78%)
and testing sets (n = 120, 97.50%). This DIHM-based artificial intelligence
methodology is simple and does not require blood staining. Thus, it will be
beneficial and valuable in the diagnosis of malaria.

BACKGROUND: Nearly half of the world's population (3.2 billion people) were at
risk of malaria in 2015, and resistance to current therapies is a major concern. 
While the standard of care includes drug combinations, there is a pressing need
to identify new combinations that can bypass current resistance mechanisms. In
the work presented here, a combined transcriptional drug repositioning/discovery 
and machine learning approach is proposed.
METHODS: The integrated approach utilizes gene expression data from
patient-derived samples, in combination with large-scale anti-malarial
combination screening data, to predict synergistic compound combinations for
three Plasmodium falciparum strains (3D7, DD2 and HB3). Both single compounds and
combinations predicted to be active were prospectively tested in experiment.
RESULTS: One of the predicted single agents, apicidin, was active with the AC50
values of 74.9, 84.1 and 74.9 nM in 3D7, DD2 and HB3 P. falciparum strains while 
its maximal safe plasma concentration in human is 547.6 ± 136.6 nM. Apicidin at
the safe dose of 500 nM kills on average 97% of the parasite. The synergy
prediction algorithm exhibited overall precision and recall of 83.5 and 65.1% for
mild-to-strong, 48.8 and 75.5% for moderate-to-strong and 12.0 and 62.7% for
strong synergies. Some of the prospectively predicted combinations, such as
tacrolimus-hydroxyzine and raloxifene-thioridazine, exhibited significant synergy
across the three P. falciparum strains included in the study.
CONCLUSIONS: Systematic approaches can play an important role in accelerating

Mosquito control with bednets, residual sprays or fumigation remains the most
effective tool for preventing vector-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue and
Zika, though there are no widely used entomological methods for directly
assessing its efficacy. Mosquito age is the most informative metric for
evaluating interventions that kill adult mosquitoes but there is no simple or
reliable way of measuring it in the field. Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) has 
been shown to be a promising, high-throughput method that can estimate the age of
mosquitoes. Currently the ability of NIRS to measure mosquito age is biased, and 
has relatively high individual mosquito measurement error, though its capacity to
rigorously monitor mosquito populations in the field has never been assessed. In 
this study, we use machine learning methods from the chemometric literature to
generate more accurate, unbiased estimates of individual mosquito age. These
unbiased estimates produce precise population-level measurements, which are
relatively insensitive to further increases in NIRS accuracy when feasible
numbers of mosquitoes are sampled. The utility of NIRS to directly measure the
impact of pyrethroid resistance on mosquito control is illustrated, showing how
the technology has potential as a highly valuable tool for directly assessing the
efficacy of mosquito control interventions.

The first challenge in the 2014 competition launched by the Teach-Discover-Treat 
(TDT) initiative asked for the development of a tutorial for ligand-based virtual
screening, based on data from a primary phenotypic high-throughput screen (HTS)
against malaria. The resulting Workflows were applied to select compounds from a 
commercial database, and a subset of those were purchased and tested
experimentally for anti-malaria activity. Here, we present the two most
successful Workflows, both using machine-learning approaches, and report the
results for the 114 compounds tested in the follow-up screen. Excluding the two
known anti-malarials quinidine and amodiaquine and 31 compounds already present
in the primary HTS, a high hit rate of 57% was found.

Primaquine (PQ) is a commonly used drug that can prevent the transmission of
Plasmodium falciparum malaria, however toxicity limits its use. We prepared five 
groups of PQ derivatives: amides 1a-k, ureas 2a-k, semicarbazides 3a,b,
acylsemicarbazides 4a-k and bis-ureas 5a-v, and evaluated them for antimalarial
activity in vitro against the erythrocytic stage of P. falciparum NF54.
Particular substituents, such as trityl (in 2j and 5r) and methoxybenzhydryl (in 
3b and 5v) were associated with a favorable cytotoxicity-to-activity ratio. To
systematically link structural features of PQ derivatives to antiplasmodial
activity, we performed a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR)
study using the Support Vector Machines machine learning method. This yielded a
highly accurate statistical model (R2 = 0.776 in cross-validation), which was
used to prioritize novel candidate compounds. Seven novel PQ-ureidoamides 10a-g
were synthesized and evaluated for activity, highlighting the benzhydryl
ureidoamides 10e and 10f derived from p-chlorophenylglycine. Further experiments 
on human cell lines revealed that 10e and 10f are an order of magnitude less
toxic than PQ in vitro while having antimalarial activity indistinguishable from 
PQ. The toxicity profile of novel compounds 10 toward human cells was
particularly favorable when the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) was
inhibited, while toxicity of PQ was exacerbated by G6PD inhibition. Our work
therefore highlights promising lead compounds for the development of effective
antimalarial drugs that may also be safer for G6PD-deficient patients. In
addition, we provide computational inferences of antimalarial activity and
cytotoxicity for thousands of PQ-like molecular structures.

Malaria remains a major burden on global health, with roughly 200 million cases
worldwide and more than 400,000 deaths per year. Besides biomedical research and 
political efforts, modern information technology is playing a key role in many
attempts at fighting the disease. One of the barriers toward a successful
mortality reduction has been inadequate malaria diagnosis in particular. To
improve diagnosis, image analysis software and machine learning methods have been
used to quantify parasitemia in microscopic blood slides. This article gives an
overview of these techniques and discusses the current developments in image
analysis and machine learning for microscopic malaria diagnosis. We organize the 
different approaches published in the literature according to the techniques used
for imaging, image preprocessing, parasite detection and cell segmentation,
feature computation, and automatic cell classification. Readers will find the
different techniques listed in tables, with the relevant articles cited next to
them, for both thin and thick blood smear images. We also discussed the latest
developments in sections devoted to deep learning and smartphone technology for
future malaria diagnosis.

The spatial distribution of genes in chromosomes seems not to be random. For
instance, only 10% of genes are transcribed from bidirectional promoters in
humans, and many more are organized into larger clusters. This raises intriguing 
questions previously asked by different authors. We would like to add a few more 
questions in this context, related to gene orientation inversions. Does gene
orientation (inversion) follow a random pattern? Is it relevant to biological
activity somehow? We define a new kind of network coined as the gene orientation 
inversion network (GOIN). GOIN's complex network encodes short- and long-range
patterns of inversion of the orientation of pairs of gene in the chromosome. We
selected Plasmodium falciparum as a case of study due to the high relevance of
this parasite to public health (causal agent of malaria). We constructed here for
the first time all of the GOINs for the genome of this parasite. These networks
have an average of 383 nodes (genes in one chromosome) and 1314 links (pairs of
gene with inverse orientation). We calculated node centralities and other
parameters of these networks. These numerical parameters were used to study
different properties of gene inversion patterns, for example, distribution, local
communities, similarity to Erdös-Rényi random networks, randomness, and so on. We
find clues that seem to indicate that gene orientation inversion does not follow 
a random pattern. We noted that some gene communities in the GOINs tend to group 
genes encoding for RIFIN-related proteins in the proteome of the parasite.
RIFIN-like proteins are a second family of clonally variant proteins expressed on
the surface of red cells infected with Plasmodium falciparum. Consequently, we
used these centralities as input of machine learning (ML) models to predict the
RIFIN-like activity of 5365 proteins in the proteome of Plasmodium sp. The best
linear ML model found discriminates RIFIN-like from other proteins with
sensitivity and specificity 70-80% in training and external validation series.
All of these results may point to a possible biological relevance of gene
orientation inversion not directly dependent on genetic sequence information.
This work opens the gate to the use of GOINs as a tool for the study of the
structure of chromosomes and the study of protein function in proteome research.

Malaria is a life-threatening infectious blood disease affecting humans and other
animals caused by parasitic protozoans belonging to the Plasmodium type
especially in developing countries. The gold standard method for the detection of
malaria is through the microscopic method of chemically treated blood smears. We 
developed an automated optical spatial coherence tomographic system using a
machine learning approach for a fast identification of malaria cells. In this
study, 28 samples (15 healthy, 13 malaria infected stages of red blood cells)
were imaged by the developed system and 13 features were extracted. We designed a
multilevel ensemble-based classifier for the quantitative prediction of different
stages of the malaria cells. The proposed classifier was used by repeating k-fold
cross validation dataset and achieve a high-average accuracy of 97.9% for
identifying malaria infected late trophozoite stage of cells. Overall, our
proposed system and multilevel ensemble model has a substantial quantifiable
potential to detect the different stages of malaria infection without staining or
expert.

This paper describes an analysis of the diversity and chemical toxicity
assessment of three chemical libraries of compounds from African flora (the
p-ANAPL, AfroMalariaDb, and Afro-HIV), respectively containing compounds
exhibiting activities against diverse diseases, malaria and HIV. The diversity of
the three data sets was done by comparison of the three most important principal 
components computed from standard molecular descriptors. This was also done by a 
study of the most common substructures (MCSS keys). Meanwhile, the in silico
toxicity predictions were done through the identification of chemical structural 
alerts using Lhasa's knowledge based Derek system. The results show that the
libraries occupy different chemical space and that only an insignificant part of 
the respective libraries could exhibit toxicities beyond acceptable limits. The
predicted toxicities end points for compounds which were predicted to "plausible"
were further discussed in the light of available experimental data in the
literature. Toxicity predictions are in agreement when using a machine learning
approach that employs graph-based structural signatures. The current study sheds 
further light towards the use of the studied chemical libraries for virtual
screening purposes.

BACKGROUND: Advocates use the hashtag #GlobalHealth on Twitter to draw users'
attention to prominent themes on global health, to harness their support, and to 
advocate for change.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to describe #GlobalHealth tweets pertinent to given major
health issues.
METHODS: Tweets containing the hashtag #GlobalHealth (N = 157,951) from January
1, 2014, to April 30, 2015, were purchased from GNIP Inc. We extracted 5
subcorpora of tweets, each with 1 of 5 co-occurring disease-specific hashtags
(#Malaria, #HIV, #TB, #NCDS, and #NTDS) for further analysis. Unsupervised
machine learning was applied to each subcorpus to categorize the tweets by their 
underlying topics and obtain the representative tweets of each topic. The topics 
were grouped into 1 of 4 themes (advocacy; epidemiological information;
prevention, control, and treatment; societal impact) or miscellaneous. Manual
categorization of most frequent users was performed. Time zones of users were
analyzed.
FINDINGS: In the entire #GlobalHealth corpus (N = 157,951), there were 40,266
unique users, 85,168 retweets, and 13,107 unique co-occurring hashtags. Of the
13,087 tweets across the 5 subcorpora with co-occurring hashtag #malaria
(n = 3640), #HIV (n = 3557), #NCDS (noncommunicable diseases; n = 2373), #TB
(tuberculosis; n = 1781), and #NTDS (neglected tropical diseases; n = 1736), the 
most prevalent theme was prevention, control, and treatment (4339, 33.16%),
followed by advocacy (3706, 28.32%), epidemiological information (1803, 13.78%), 
and societal impact (1617, 12.36%). Among the top 10 users who tweeted the
highest number of tweets in the #GlobalHealth corpus, 5 were individual
professionals, 3 were news media, and 2 were organizations advocating for global 
health. The most common users' time zone was Eastern Time (United States and
Canada).
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlighted the specific #GlobalHealth Twitter
conversations pertinent to malaria, HIV, tuberculosis, noncommunicable diseases, 
and neglected tropical diseases. These conversations reflect the priorities of
advocates, funders, policymakers, and practitioners of global health on these
high-burden diseases as they presented their views and information on Twitter to 
their followers.

Brain swelling is a major predictor of mortality in pediatric cerebral malaria
(CM). However, the mechanisms leading to swelling remain poorly defined. Here, we
combined neuroimaging, parasite transcript profiling, and laboratory blood
profiles to develop machine-learning models of malarial retinopathy and brain
swelling. We found that parasite var transcripts encoding endothelial protein C
receptor (EPCR)-binding domains, in combination with high parasite biomass and
low platelet levels, are strong indicators of CM cases with malarial retinopathy.
Swelling cases presented low platelet levels and increased transcript abundance
of parasite PfEMP1 DC8 and group A EPCR-binding domains. Remarkably, the dominant
transcript in 50% of swelling cases encoded PfEMP1 group A CIDRα1.7 domains.
Furthermore, a recombinant CIDRα1.7 domain from a pediatric CM brain autopsy
inhibited the barrier-protective properties of EPCR in human brain endothelial
cells in vitro. Together, these findings suggest a detrimental role for
EPCR-binding CIDRα1 domains in brain swelling.

Machine learning methods have been applied to many data sets in pharmaceutical
research for several decades. The relative ease and availability of fingerprint
type molecular descriptors paired with Bayesian methods resulted in the
widespread use of this approach for a diverse array of end points relevant to
drug discovery. Deep learning is the latest machine learning algorithm attracting
attention for many of pharmaceutical applications from docking to virtual
screening. Deep learning is based on an artificial neural network with multiple
hidden layers and has found considerable traction for many artificial
intelligence applications. We have previously suggested the need for a comparison
of different machine learning methods with deep learning across an array of
varying data sets that is applicable to pharmaceutical research. End points
relevant to pharmaceutical research include absorption, distribution, metabolism,
excretion, and toxicity (ADME/Tox) properties, as well as activity against
pathogens and drug discovery data sets. In this study, we have used data sets for
solubility, probe-likeness, hERG, KCNQ1, bubonic plague, Chagas, tuberculosis,
and malaria to compare different machine learning methods using FCFP6
fingerprints. These data sets represent whole cell screens, individual proteins, 
physicochemical properties as well as a data set with a complex end point. Our
aim was to assess whether deep learning offered any improvement in testing when
assessed using an array of metrics including AUC, F1 score, Cohen's kappa,
Matthews correlation coefficient and others. Based on ranked normalized scores
for the metrics or data sets Deep Neural Networks (DNN) ranked higher than SVM,
which in turn was ranked higher than all the other machine learning methods.

indicates when models are inferior or perhaps over trained. These results also
suggest the need for assessing deep learning further using multiple metrics with 
much larger scale comparisons, prospective testing as well as assessment of
different fingerprints and DNN architectures beyond those used.

Web-enabled e-healthcare system or computer assisted disease diagnosis has a
potential to improve the quality and service of conventional healthcare delivery 
approach. The article describes the design and development of a web-based
distributed healthcare management system for medical information and quantitative
evaluation of microscopic images using machine learning approach for malaria. In 
the proposed study, all the health-care centres are connected in a distributed
computer network. Each peripheral centre manages its' own health-care service
independently and communicates with the central server for remote assistance. The
proposed methodology for automated evaluation of parasites includes
pre-processing of blood smear microscopic images followed by erythrocytes
segmentation. To differentiate between different parasites; a total of 138
quantitative features characterising colour, morphology, and texture are
extracted from segmented erythrocytes. An integrated pattern classification
framework is designed where four feature selection methods viz. Correlation-based
Feature Selection (CFS), Chi-square, Information Gain, and RELIEF are employed
with three different classifiers i.e. Naive Bayes', C4.5, and Instance-Based
Learning (IB1) individually. Optimal features subset with the best classifier is 
selected for achieving maximum diagnostic precision. It is seen that the proposed
method achieved with 99.2% sensitivity and 99.6% specificity by combining CFS and
C4.5 in comparison with other methods. Moreover, the web-based tool is entirely
designed using open standards like Java for a web application, ImageJ for image
processing, and WEKA for data mining considering its feasibility in rural places 
with minimal health care facilities.

Identification of immune signatures predictive of clinical protection from
malaria.

Author information:

Campus, Penryn, United Kingdom.

Antibodies are thought to play an essential role in naturally acquired immunity
to malaria. Prospective cohort studies have frequently shown how continuous
exposure to the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum cause an accumulation of
specific responses against various antigens that correlate with a decreased risk 
of clinical malaria episodes. However, small effect sizes and the often
polymorphic nature of immunogenic parasite proteins make the robust
identification of the true targets of protective immunity ambiguous. Furthermore,
the degree of individual-level protection conferred by elevated responses to
these antigens has not yet been explored. Here we applied a machine learning
approach to identify immune signatures predictive of individual-level protection 
against clinical disease. We find that commonly assumed immune correlates are
poor predictors of clinical protection in children. On the other hand, antibody
profiles predictive of an individual's malaria protective status can be found in 
data comprising responses to a large set of diverse parasite proteins. We show
that this pattern emerges only after years of continuous exposure to the malaria 
parasite, whereas susceptibility to clinical episodes in young hosts (< 10 years)
cannot be ascertained by measured antibody responses alone.

This paper presents the QAMDiagnos, a model of Quantum Associative Memory (QAM)
that can be a helpful tool for medical staff without experience or laboratory
facilities, for the diagnosis of four tropical diseases (malaria, typhoid fever, 
yellow fever and dengue) which have several similar signs and symptoms. The
memory can distinguish a single infection from a polyinfection. Our model is a
combination of the improved versions of the original linear quantum retrieving
algorithm proposed by Ventura and the non-linear quantum search algorithm of
Abrams and Lloyd. From the given simulation results, it appears that the
efficiency of recognition is good when particular signs and symptoms of a disease
are inserted given that the linear algorithm is the main algorithm. The
non-linear algorithm helps confirm or correct the diagnosis or give some advice
to the medical staff for the treatment. So, our QAMDiagnos that has a friendly
graphical user interface for desktop and smart-phone is a sensitive and a
low-cost diagnostic tool that enables rapid and accurate diagnosis of four
tropical diseases.

Accurate malaria diagnosis is critical to prevent malaria fatalities, curb
overuse of antimalarial drugs, and promote appropriate management of other causes
of fever. While several diagnostic tests exist, the need for a rapid and highly
accurate malaria assay remains. Microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests are the
main diagnostic modalities available, yet they can demonstrate poor performance
and accuracy. Automated microscopy platforms have the potential to significantly 
improve and standardize malaria diagnosis. Based on image recognition and machine
learning algorithms, these systems maintain the benefits of light microscopy and 
provide improvements such as quicker scanning time, greater scanning area, and
increased consistency brought by automation. While these applications have been
in development for over a decade, recently several commercial platforms have
emerged. In this review, we discuss the most advanced computer vision malaria
diagnostic technologies and investigate several of their features which are
central to field use. Additionally, we discuss the technological and policy
barriers to implementing these technologies in low-resource settings world-wide.

New Delhi-67.

Malaria is a predominant infectious disease, with a global footprint, but
especially severe in developing countries in the African subcontinent. In recent 
years, drug-resistant malaria has become an alarming factor, and hence the
requirement of new and improved drugs is more crucial than ever before. One of
the promising locations for antimalarial drug target is the apicoplast, as this
organelle does not occur in humans. The apicoplast is associated with many unique
and essential pathways in many Apicomplexan pathogens, including Plasmodium. The 
use of machine learning methods is now commonly available through open source
programs. In the present work, we describe a standard protocol to develop
molecular descriptor based predictive models (QSAR models), which can be further 
utilized for the screening of large chemical libraries. This protocol is used to 
build models using training data sourced from apicoplast specific bioassays.
Multiple model building methods are used including Generalized Linear Models
(GLM), Random Forest (RF), C5.0 implementation of a decision tree, Support Vector
Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbour and Naive Bayes. Methods to evaluate the
accuracy of the model building method are included in the protocol. For the given
dataset, the C5.0, SVM and RF perform better than other methods, with comparable 
accuracy over the test data.

BACKGROUND: Serological antibody levels are a sensitive marker of pathogen
exposure, and advances in multiplex assays have created enormous potential for
large-scale, integrated infectious disease surveillance. Most methods to analyze 
antibody measurements reduce quantitative antibody levels to seropositive and
seronegative groups, but this can be difficult for many pathogens and may provide
lower resolution information than quantitative levels. Analysis methods have
predominantly maintained a single disease focus, yet integrated surveillance
platforms would benefit from methodologies that work across diverse pathogens
included in multiplex assays.
METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We developed an approach to measure changes in
transmission from quantitative antibody levels that can be applied to diverse
pathogens of global importance. We compared age-dependent immunoglobulin G curves
in repeated cross-sectional surveys between populations with differences in
transmission for multiple pathogens, including: lymphatic filariasis (Wuchereria 
bancrofti) measured before and after mass drug administration on Mauke, Cook
Islands, malaria (Plasmodium falciparum) before and after a combined insecticide 
and mass drug administration intervention in the Garki project, Nigeria, and
enteric protozoans (Cryptosporidium parvum, Giardia intestinalis, Entamoeba
histolytica), bacteria (enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp.), and
viruses (norovirus groups I and II) in children living in Haiti and the USA.
Age-dependent antibody curves fit with ensemble machine learning followed a
characteristic shape across pathogens that aligned with predictions from basic
mechanisms of humoral immunity. Differences in pathogen transmission led to
shifts in fitted antibody curves that were remarkably consistent across
pathogens, assays, and populations. Mean antibody levels correlated strongly with
traditional measures of transmission intensity, such as the entomological
inoculation rate for P. falciparum (Spearman's rho = 0.75). In both high- and low
transmission settings, mean antibody curves revealed changes in population mean
antibody levels that were masked by seroprevalence measures because changes took 
place above or below the seropositivity cutoff.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Age-dependent antibody curves and summary means
provided a robust and sensitive measure of changes in transmission, with greatest
sensitivity among young children. The method generalizes to pathogens that can be
measured in high-throughput, multiplex serological assays, and scales to
surveillance activities that require high spatiotemporal resolution. Our results 
suggest quantitative antibody levels will be particularly useful to measure
differences in exposure for pathogens that elicit a transient antibody response
or for monitoring populations with very high- or very low transmission, when
seroprevalence is less informative. The approach represents a new opportunity to 
conduct integrated serological surveillance for neglected tropical diseases,
malaria, and other infectious diseases with well-defined antigen targets.

The discovery, validation, and characterization of protein-based interactions
from different species are crucial for translational research regarding a variety
of pathogens, ranging from the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum to HIV-1.
Here, we review recent advances in the prediction of host-pathogen protein
interfaces using structural information. In particular, we observe that current
methods chiefly perform machine learning on sequence and domain information to
produce large sets of candidate interactions that are further assessed and pruned
to generate final, highly probable sets. Structure-based studies have also
emphasized the electrostatic properties and evolutionary transformations of
pathogenic interfaces, supplying crucial insight into antigenic determinants and 
the ways pathogens compete for host protein binding. Advancements in
spectroscopic and crystallographic methods complement the aforementioned
techniques, permitting the rigorous study of true positives at a molecular level.
Together, these approaches illustrate how protein structure on a variety of
levels functions coordinately and dynamically to achieve host takeover.

Parasite.

BACKGROUND: Discovery of apicoplast as a drug target offers a new direction in
the development of novel anti-malarial compounds, especially against the
drug-resistant strains. Drugs such as azithromycin were reported to block the
apicoplast development that leads to unusual phenotypes affecting the parasite.
This phenomenon suggests that identification of new apicoplast inhibitors will
aid in the anti-malarial drug discovery. Therefore, in this study, we developed a
computational model to predict apicoplast inhibitors by applying state-of-the-art
machine learning techniques.
METHODS: We have used two high-throughput chemical screening data (AID-504850,
AID-504848) from PubChem BioAssay database and applied machine learning
techniques. The performance of the models were assessed on various types of
binary fingerprints.
RESULTS: In this study, we developed a robust computational algorithm for the
prediction of apicoplast inhibition. We observed 73.7% sensitivity and 84%
specificity along with 81.4% accuracy rate only on 41 PubChem fingerprints on 48 
hrs dataset. Similarly, an accuracy rate of 75.8% was observed for 96 hrs
dataset. Additionally, we observed that our model has ~70% positive prediction
rate on the independent dataset obtained from ChEMBL-NTD database. Furthermore,
the fingerprint analysis suggested that compounds with at least one heteroatom
containing hexagonal ring would most likely belong to the antimalarial category
as compared to simple aliphatic compounds. We also observed that aromatic
compounds with oxygen and chlorine atoms were preferred in inhibitors class as
compared to sulphur. Additionally, the compounds with average molecular weight
>380Da and XlogP>4 were most likely to belong to the inhibitor category.
CONCLUSION: This study highlighted the significance of simple interpretable
molecular properties along with some preferred substructure in designing the
novel anti-malarial compounds. In addition to that, robustness and accuracy of
models developed in the present work could be utilized to screen a large chemical
library. Based on this study, we developed freely available software at
http://deepaklab. com/capi. This study would provide the best alternative for
searching the novel apicoplast inhibitors against Plasmodium.

The development of new antimalarial therapies is essential, and lowering the
barrier of entry for the screening and discovery of new lead compound classes can
spur drug development at organizations that may not have large compound screening
libraries or resources to conduct high-throughput screens. Machine learning
models have been long established to be more robust and have a larger domain of
applicability with larger training sets. Screens over multiple data sets to find 
compounds with potential malaria blood stage inhibitory activity have been used
to generate multiple Bayesian models. Here we describe a method by which Bayesian
quantitative structure-activity relationship models, which contain information on
thousands to millions of proprietary compounds, can be shared between
collaborators at both for-profit and not-for-profit institutions. This
model-sharing paradigm allows for the development of consensus models that have
increased predictive power over any single model and yet does not reveal the
identity of any compounds in the training sets.

The World Health Organization estimates that nearly 500 million malaria tests are
performed annually. While microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are the
main diagnostic approaches, no single method is inexpensive, rapid, and highly
accurate. Two recent studies from our group have demonstrated a prototype
computer vision platform that meets those needs. Here we present the results from
two clinical studies on the commercially available version of this technology,
the Sight Diagnostics Parasight platform, which provides malaria diagnosis,
species identification, and parasite quantification. We conducted a multisite
trial in Chennai, India (Apollo Hospital [n = 205]), and Nairobi, Kenya (Aga Khan
University Hospital [n = 263]), in which we compared the device to microscopy,
RDTs, and PCR. For identification of malaria, the device performed similarly well
in both contexts (sensitivity of 99% and specificity of 100% at the Indian site
and sensitivity of 99.3% and specificity of 98.9% at the Kenyan site, compared to
PCR). For species identification, the device correctly identified 100% of samples
with Plasmodium vivax and 100% of samples with Plasmodium falciparum in India and
100% of samples with P. vivax and 96.1% of samples with P. falciparum in Kenya,
compared to PCR. Lastly, comparisons of the device parasite counts with those of 
trained microscopists produced average Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.84
at the Indian site and 0.85 at the Kenyan site.

Background: Pediatric acute respiratory distress in tropical settings is very
common. Bacterial pneumonia is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality
rates and requires adequate diagnosis for correct treatment. A rapid test that
could identify bacterial (vs other) infections would have great clinical utility.
Methods and Results: We performed RNA (RNA-seq) sequencing and analyzed the
transcriptomes of 68 pediatric patients with well-characterized clinical
phenotype to identify transcriptional features associated with each disease
class. We refined the features to predictive models (support vector machine,
elastic net) and validated those models in an independent test set of 37 patients
(80%-85% accuracy).
Conclusions: We have identified sets of genes that are differentially expressed
in pediatric patients with pneumonia syndrome attributable to different
infections and requiring different therapeutic interventions. Findings of this
study demonstrate that human transcription signatures in infected patients
recapitulate the underlying biology and provide models for predicting a bacterial
diagnosis to inform treatment.

Malaria detection through microscopic examination of stained blood smears is a
diagnostic challenge that heavily relies on the expertise of trained
microscopists. This paper presents an automated analysis method for detection and
staging of red blood cells infected by the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum
at trophozoite or schizont stage. Unlike previous efforts in this area, this
study uses quantitative phase images of unstained cells. Erythrocytes are
automatically segmented using thresholds of optical phase and refocused to enable
quantitative comparison of phase images. Refocused images are analyzed to extract
23 morphological descriptors based on the phase information. While all individual
descriptors are highly statistically different between infected and uninfected
cells, each descriptor does not enable separation of populations at a level
satisfactory for clinical utility. To improve the diagnostic capacity, we applied
various machine learning techniques, including linear discriminant classification
(LDC), logistic regression (LR), and k-nearest neighbor classification (NNC), to 
formulate algorithms that combine all of the calculated physical parameters to
distinguish cells more effectively. Results show that LDC provides the highest
accuracy of up to 99.7% in detecting schizont stage infected cells compared to
uninfected RBCs. NNC showed slightly better accuracy (99.5%) than either LDC
(99.0%) or LR (99.1%) for discriminating late trophozoites from uninfected RBCs. 
However, for early trophozoites, LDC produced the best accuracy of 98%.
Discrimination of infection stage was less accurate, producing high specificity
(99.8%) but only 45.0%-66.8% sensitivity with early trophozoites most often
mistaken for late trophozoite or schizont stage and late trophozoite and schizont
stage most often confused for each other. Overall, this methodology points to a
significant clinical potential of using quantitative phase imaging to detect and 
stage malaria infection without staining or expert analysis.

Malaria remains a dreadful disease by putting every year about 3.4 billion people
at risk and resulting into mortality of 627 thousand people worldwide. Existing
therapies based upon Quinines and Artemisinin-based combination therapies have
started showing resistance, pressing the need for search of anti-malarials with
different mechanisms of action. In this respect erythrocyte invasion by
Plasmodium is immensely crucial, as being obligate intracellular parasite it must
invade host cells. This process is mediated by interaction between conserved
Apical Membrane Antigen (AMA1) and Rhoptry Neck (RON2) protein, which is
compulsory for successful invasion of erythrocyte by Plasmodium and manifestation
of the disease Malaria. Here, using the physicochemical properties of the
compounds available from a confirmatory high throughput screening, which were
tested for their disruption capability of this crucial molecular interaction, we 
trained supervised classifiers and validated their robustness by various
statistical parameters. Best model was used for screening new compounds from
Traditional Chinese Medicine Database. Some of the best hits already find their
use as anti-malarials and the model predicts that an essential part of their
effectiveness is likely due to inhibition of AMA1-RON2 interaction.
Pharmacophoric features have also been identified to ease further designing of
possible leads in an effective way.

Malaria is a parasitic tropical disease that kills around 600,000 patients every 
year. The emergence of resistant Plasmodium falciparum parasites to
artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) represents a significant public
health threat, indicating the urgent need for new effective compounds to reverse 
ACT resistance and cure the disease. For this, extensive curation and
homogenization of experimental anti-Plasmodium screening data from both in-house 
and ChEMBL sources were conducted. As a result, a coherent strategy was
established that allowed compiling coherent training sets that associate compound
structures to the respective antimalarial activity measurements. Seventeen of
these training sets led to the successful generation of classification models
discriminating whether a compound has a significant probability to be active
under the specific conditions of the antimalarial test associated with each set. 
These models were used in consensus prediction of the most likely active from a
series of curcuminoids available in-house. Positive predictions together with a
few predicted as inactive were then submitted to experimental in vitro
antimalarial testing. A large majority from predicted compounds showed
antimalarial activity, but not those predicted as inactive, thus experimentally
validating the in silico screening approach. The herein proposed consensus
machine learning approach showed its potential to reduce the cost and duration of
antimalarial drug discovery.

The interplay between cellular and molecular determinants that lead to severe
malaria in adults is unexplored. Here, we analyzed parasite virulence factors in 
an infected adult population in India and investigated whether severe malaria
isolates impair endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR), a protein involved in
coagulation and endothelial barrier permeability. Severe malaria isolates
overexpressed specific members of the Plasmodium falciparum var gene/PfEMP1 (P.
falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1) family that bind EPCR, including DC8
var genes that have previously been linked to severe pediatric malaria. Machine
learning analysis revealed that DC6- and DC8-encoding var transcripts in
combination with high parasite biomass were the strongest indicators of patient
hospitalization and disease severity. We found that DC8 CIDRα1 domains from
severe malaria isolates had substantial differences in EPCR binding affinity and 
blockade activity for its ligand activated protein C. Additionally, even a low
level of inhibition exhibited by domains from two cerebral malaria isolates was
sufficient to interfere with activated protein C-barrier protective activities in
human brain endothelial cells. Our findings demonstrate an interplay between
parasite biomass and specific PfEMP1 adhesion types in the development of adult
severe malaria, and indicate that low impairment of EPCR function may contribute 
to parasite virulence.

Malaria parasites show resistance to most of the antimalarial drugs and hence
developing antimalarials which can act on multitargets rather than a single
target will be a promising strategy of drug design. Here we report a new approach
by which virtual screening of 292 unique phytochemicals present in 72
traditionally important herbs is used for finding out inhibitors of plasmepsin-2 
and falcipain-2 for antimalarial activity against P. falciparum. Initial
screenings of the selected molecules by Random Forest algorithm model of Weka
using the bioassay datasets AID 504850 and AID 2302 screened 120 out of the total
292 phytochemicals to be active against the targets. Toxtree scan cautioned 21
compounds to be either carcinogenic or mutagenic and were thus removed for
further analysis. Out of the remaining 99 compounds, only 46 compounds offered
drug-likeness as per the 'rule of five' criteria. Out of ten antimalarial drug
targets, only two target proteins such as 3BPF and 3PNR of falcipain-2 and 1PFZ
and 2BJU of plasmepsin-2 are selected as targets. The potential binding of the
selected 46 compounds to the active sites of these four targets was analyzed
using MOE software. The docked conformations and the interactions with the
binding pocket residues of the target proteins were understood by 'Ligplot'
analysis. It has been found that 8 compounds are dual inhibitors of falcipain-2
and plasmepsin-2, with the best binding energies. Compound 117 (6aR,
12aS)-12a-Hydroxy-9-methoxy-2,3-dimethylenedioxy-8-prenylrotenone (Usaratenoid C)
present in the plant Millettia usaramensis showed maximum molecular docking
score.

Identifying targets of selection in mosaic genomes with machine learning:
applications in Anopheles gambiae for detecting sites within locally adapted
chromosomal inversions.

Michigan, 1109 Geddes Ave., Ann Arbor, MI, 48109-1079, USA.

Chromosomal inversions are important structural changes that may facilitate
divergent selection when they capture co-adaptive loci in the face of gene flow. 
However, identifying selection targets within inversions can be challenging. The 
high degrees of differentiation between heterokaryotypes, as well as the
differences in demographic histories of collinear regions compared with inverted 
ones, reduce the power of traditional outlier analyses for detecting selected
loci. Here, we develop a new approach that uses discriminant functions informed
from inversion-specific expectations to classify loci that are under selection
(or drift). Analysis of RAD sequencing data we collected in a classic dipteran
species with polymorphic inversion clines-Anopheles gambiae, a malaria vector
species from sub-Saharan Africa-demonstrates the benefits of the approach
compared with traditional outlier analyses. We focus specifically on two
polymorphic inversions, the 2La and 2Rb arrangements that predominate in dry
habitats and the 2L+(a) and 2R+(b) arrangements in wet habitats, which contrast
with the minimal geographic structure of SNPs from collinear regions. With our
approach, we identify two strongly selected regions within 2La associated with
dry habitat. Moreover, we also show that the prevalence of selection is greater
in the arrangement 2L+(a) that is associated with wet habitat (unlike presumed
importance of selective divergence associated with the shift of the mosquitoes
into dry habitats). We discuss the implications of these results with respect to 
studies of rapid adaptation in these malaria vectors, and in particular, the
insights our newly developed approach offers for identifying not only potential
targets of selection, but also the population that has undergone adaptive change.

Lysine acetylation is a ubiquitous post-translational modification in many
organisms including the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, yet the full
extent of acetylation across the parasite proteome remains unresolved. Moreover, 
the functional significance of acetylation or how specific acetyl-lysine sites
are regulated is largely unknown. Here we report a seven-fold expansion of the
known parasite 'acetylome', characterizing 2,876 acetylation sites on 1,146
proteins. We observe that lysine acetylation targets a diverse range of protein
complexes and is particularly enriched within the Apicomplexan AP2 (ApiAP2)
DNA-binding protein family. Using quantitative proteomics we determined that
artificial perturbation of the acetate/acetyl-CoA balance alters the
acetyl-lysine occupancy of several ApiAP2 DNA-binding proteins and related
transcriptional proteins. This metabolic signaling could mediate significant
downstream transcriptional responses, as we show that acetylation of an ApiAP2
DNA-binding domain ablates its DNA-binding propensity. Lastly, we investigated
the acetyl-lysine targets of each class of lysine deacetylase in order to begin
to explore how each class of enzyme contributes to regulating the P. falciparum
acetylome.

The search for small molecule inhibitors of Ebola virus (EBOV) has led to several
high throughput screens over the past 3 years. These have identified a range of
FDA-approved active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) with anti-EBOV activity in 
vitro and several of which are also active in a mouse infection model. There are 
millions of additional commercially-available molecules that could be screened
for potential activities as anti-EBOV compounds. One way to prioritize compounds 
for testing is to generate computational models based on the high throughput
screening data and then virtually screen compound libraries. In the current
study, we have generated Bayesian machine learning models with viral pseudotype
entry assay and the EBOV replication assay data. We have validated the models
internally and externally. We have also used these models to computationally
score the MicroSource library of drugs to select those likely to be potential
inhibitors. Three of the highest scoring molecules that were not in the model
training sets, quinacrine, pyronaridine and tilorone, were tested in vitro and
had EC 50 values of 350, 420 and 230 nM, respectively. Pyronaridine is a
component of a combination therapy for malaria that was recently approved by the 
European Medicines Agency, which may make it more readily accessible for clinical
testing. Like other known antimalarial drugs active against EBOV, it shares the
4-aminoquinoline scaffold. Tilorone, is an investigational antiviral agent that
has shown a broad array of biological activities including cell growth inhibition
in cancer cells, antifibrotic properties, α7 nicotinic receptor agonist activity,
radioprotective activity and activation of hypoxia inducible factor-1. Quinacrine
is an antimalarial but also has use as an anthelmintic. Our results suggest data 
sets with less than 1,000 molecules can produce validated machine learning models
that can in turn be utilized to identify novel EBOV inhibitors in vitro.

BACKGROUND: There are increasing efforts to bring high-throughput systems biology
techniques to bear on complex animal model systems, often with a goal of learning
about underlying regulatory network structures (e.g., gene regulatory networks). 
However, complex animal model systems typically have significant limitations on
cohort sizes, number of samples, and the ability to perform follow-up and
validation experiments. These constraints are particularly problematic for many
current network learning approaches, which require large numbers of samples and
may predict many more regulatory relationships than actually exist.
RESULTS: Here, we test the idea that by leveraging the accuracy and efficiency of
classifiers, we can construct high-quality networks that capture important
interactions between variables in datasets with few samples. We start from a
previously-developed tree-like Bayesian classifier and generalize its network
learning approach to allow for arbitrary depth and complexity of tree-like
networks. Using four diverse sample networks, we demonstrate that this approach
performs consistently better at low sample sizes than the Sparse Candidate
Algorithm, a representative approach for comparison because it is known to
generate Bayesian networks with high positive predictive value. We develop and
demonstrate a resampling-based approach to enable the identification of a viable 
root for the learned tree-like network, important for cases where the root of a
network is not known a priori. We also develop and demonstrate an integrated
resampling-based approach to the reduction of variable space for the learning of 
the network. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of this approach via the
analysis of a transcriptional dataset of a malaria challenge in a non-human
primate model system, Macaca mulatta, suggesting the potential to capture
indicators of the earliest stages of cellular differentiation during
leukopoiesis.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that by starting from effective and efficient
approaches for creating classifiers, we can identify interesting tree-like
network structures with significant ability to capture the relationships in the
training data. This approach represents a promising strategy for inferring
networks with high positive predictive value under the constraint of small
numbers of samples, meeting a need that will only continue to grow as more
high-throughput studies are applied to complex model systems.

Among the chemometric tools used in rational drug design, we find artificial
neural network methods (ANNs), a statistical learning algorithm similar to the
human brain, to be quite powerful. Some ANN applications use biological and
molecular data of the training series that are inserted to ensure the machine
learning, and to generate robust and predictive models. In drug discovery,
researchers use this methodology, looking to find new chemotherapeutic agents for
various diseases. The neglected diseases are a group of tropical parasitic
diseases that primarily affect poor countries in Africa, Asia, and South America.
Current drugs against these diseases cause side effects, are ineffective during
the chronic stages of the disease, and are often not available to the needy
population, have relative high toxicity, and face developing resistance. Faced
with so many problems, new chemotherapeutic agents to treat these infections are 
much needed. The present review reports on neural network research, which studies
new ligands against Chagas' disease, sleeping sickness, malaria, tuberculosis,
and leishmaniasis; a few of the neglected diseases.

Although freshwater (FW) is the ancestral habitat for larval mosquitoes, multiple
species independently evolved the ability to survive in saltwater (SW). Here, we 
use quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping to investigate the genetic
architecture of osmoregulation in Anopheles mosquitoes, vectors of human malaria.
We analyzed 1134 backcross progeny from a cross between the obligate FW species
An. coluzzii, and its closely related euryhaline sibling species An. merus. Tests
of 2387 markers with Bayesian interval mapping and machine learning (random
forests) yielded six genomic regions associated with SW tolerance. Overlap in QTL
regions from both approaches enhances confidence in QTL identification. Evidence 
exists for synergistic as well as disruptive epistasis among loci. Intriguingly, 
one QTL region containing ion transporters spans the 2Rop chromosomal inversion
that distinguishes these species. Rather than a simple trait controlled by one or
a few loci, our data are most consistent with a complex, polygenic mode of
inheritance.

Machine learning techniques have been widely used in drug discovery and
development in the areas of cheminformatics. Aspartyl aminopeptidase (M18AAP) of 
Plasmodium falciparum is crucial for survival of malaria parasite. We have
created predictive models using weka and evaluated their performance based on
various statistical parameters. Random Forest based model was found to be the
most specificity (97.94%), with best accuracy (97.3%), MCC (0.306) as well as ROC
(86.1%). The accuracy and MCC of these models indicated that they could be used
to classify huge dataset of unknown compounds to predict their antimalarial
compounds to develop effective drugs. Further, we deployed best predictive model 
on NCI diversity set IV. As result we found 59 bioactive anti-malarial molecules 
inhibiting M18AAP. Further, we obtained 18 non-toxic hit molecules out of 59
bioactive compounds. We suggest that such machine learning approaches could be
applied to reduce the cost and length of time of drug discovery.

The Chagas disease is a potentially life-threatening illness caused by the
protozoan parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi. Visual detection of such parasite through 
microscopic inspection is a tedious and time-consuming task. In this paper, we
provide an AdaBoost learning solution to the task of Chagas parasite detection in
blood images. We give details of the algorithm and our experimental setup. With
this method, we get 100% and 93.25% of sensitivity and specificity, respectively.
A ROC comparison with the method most commonly used for the detection of malaria 
parasites based on support vector machines (SVM) is also provided. Our
experimental work shows mainly two things: (1) Chagas parasites can be detected
automatically using machine learning methods with high accuracy and (2) AdaBoost 
+ SVM provides better overall detection performance than AdaBoost or SVMs alone. 
Such results are the best ones known so far for the problem of automatic
detection of Chagas parasites through the use of machine learning, computer
vision, and image processing methods.

Currently, the majority of diagnoses of malaria rely on a combination of the
patient's clinical presentation and the visualization of parasites on a stained
blood film. Breath offers an attractive alternative to blood as the basis for
simple, noninvasive diagnosis of infectious diseases. In this study, breath
samples were collected from individuals during controlled malaria to determine
whether specific malaria-associated volatiles could be detected in breath. We
identified 9 compounds whose concentrations varied significantly over the course 
of malaria: carbon dioxide, isoprene, acetone, benzene, cyclohexanone, and 4
thioethers. The latter group, consisting of allyl methyl sulfide,
1-methylthio-propane, (Z)-1-methylthio-1-propene, and (E)-1-methylthio-1-propene,
had not previously been associated with any disease or condition. Before the
availability of antimalarial drug treatment, there was evidence of concurrent
48-hour cyclical changes in the levels of both thioethers and parasitemia. When
thioether concentrations were subjected to a phase shift of 24 hours, a direct
correlation between the parasitemia and volatile levels was revealed. Volatile
levels declined monotonically approximately 6.5 hours after initial drug
treatment, correlating with clearance of parasitemia. No thioethers were detected
in in vitro cultures of Plasmodium falciparum. The metabolic origin of the
thioethers is not known, but results suggest that interplay between host and
parasite metabolic pathways is involved in the production of these thioethers.

In modern drug discovery era, multi target- quantitative structure activity
relationship [mt- (Q)SAR] approaches have emerged as novel and powerful
alternatives in the field of in-silico drug design so as to facilitate the
discovery of new chemical entities with multiple biological activities. Amongst
various machine learning approaches, moving average analysis (MAA) has frequently
exhibited high accuracy of prediction of diverse biological activities against
different biological targets and experimental conditions. Role of MAA in
developing (Q)SAR models for prediction of single/dual or multi target activity
has been briefly reviewed in the present article. Subsequently, MAA was
successfully utilized for developing mt-(Q)SAR models for simultaneous prediction
of anti-Plasmodium falciparum and anti-Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense activities 
of benzyl phenyl ether derivatives. The statistical significance of models was
assessed through intercorrelation analysis, sensitivity, specificity and
Matthew's correlation coefficient. Proposed MAA based models were also validated 
using test set. High predictability of the order of 80% to 95% amalgamated with
safety (indicated by high value of selectivity index) of proposed mt-(Q)SAR
models justifies use of MAA in developing models in order to obtain more
realistic and accurate results for prediction of anti-protozal activity against
multiple targets. Active ranges of the proposed models can play a significant
role in the development of novel, potent, versatile and safe anti-protozoal drugs
with improved profile in terms of both anti-Plasmodium falciparum and
anti-Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense activities.

A large quantity of high throughput screening (HTS) data for antimalarial
activity has become available in recent years. This includes both phenotypic and 
target-based activity. Realising the maximum value of these data remains a
challenge. In this respect, methods that allow such data to be used for virtual
screening maximise efficiency and reduce costs. In this study both in vitro
antimalarial activity and inhibitory data for β-haematin formation, largely
obtained from publically available sources, has been used to develop Bayesian
models for inhibitors of β-haematin formation and in vitro antimalarial activity.
These models were used to screen two in silico compound libraries. In the first, 
the 1510 U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved drugs available on PubChem
were ranked from highest to lowest Bayesian score based on a training set of
β-haematin inhibiting compounds active against Plasmodium falciparum that did not
include any of the clinical antimalarials or close analogues. The six known
clinical antimalarials that inhibit β-haematin formation were ranked in the top
2.1% of compounds. Furthermore, the in vitro antimalarial hit-rate for this
prioritised set of compounds was found to be 81% in the case of the subset where 
activity data are available in PubChem. In the second, a library of about 5000
commercially available compounds (Aldrich(CPR)) was virtually screened for
ability to inhibit β-haematin formation and then for in vitro antimalarial
activity. A selection of 34 compounds was purchased and tested, of which 24 were 
predicted to be β-haematin inhibitors. The hit rate for inhibition of β-haematin 
formation was found to be 25% and a third of these were active against P.
falciparum, corresponding to enrichments estimated at about 25- and 140-fold
relative to random screening, respectively.

Malaria remains one of the most prevalent and lethal human infectious diseases
worldwide. A comprehensive characterization of antibody responses to blood stage 
malaria is essential to support the development of future vaccines,
sero-diagnostic tests, and sero-surveillance methods. We constructed a proteome
array containing 4441 recombinant proteins expressed by the blood stages of the
two most common human malaria parasites, P. falciparum (Pf) and P. vivax (Pv),
and used this array to screen sera of Papua New Guinea children infected with Pf,
Pv, or both (Pf/Pv) that were either symptomatic (febrile), or asymptomatic but
had parasitemia detectable via microscopy or PCR. We hypothesized that
asymptomatic children would develop antigen-specific antibody profiles associated
with antidisease immunity, as compared with symptomatic children. The sera from
these children recognized hundreds of the arrayed recombinant Pf and Pv proteins.
In general, responses in asymptomatic children were highest in those with high
parasitemia, suggesting that antibody levels are associated with parasite burden.
In contrast, symptomatic children carried fewer antibodies than asymptomatic
children with infections detectable by microscopy, particularly in Pv and Pf/Pv
groups, suggesting that antibody production may be impaired during symptomatic
infections. We used machine-learning algorithms to investigate the relationship
between antibody responses and symptoms, and we identified antibody responses to 
sets of Plasmodium proteins that could predict clinical status of the donors.
Several of these antibody responses were identified by multiple comparisons,
including those against members of the serine enriched repeat antigen family and 
merozoite protein 4. Interestingly, both P. falciparum serine enriched repeat
antigen-5 and merozoite protein 4 have been previously investigated for use in
vaccines. This machine learning approach, never previously applied to proteome
arrays, can be used to generate a list of potential seroprotective and/or
diagnostic antigens candidates that can be further evaluated in longitudinal
studies.

Machine learning (ML) has been extensively applied to develop models and to
understand high-throughput data of biological processes. However, new ML models, 
trained with novel experimental results, are required to build regularly for more
precise predictions. ML methods can build models from numeric data, whereas
biological data are generally textual (DNA, protein sequences) or images and
needs feature calculation algorithms to generate quantitative features.
Programming skills along with domain knowledge are required to develop these
algorithms. Therefore, the process of knowledge discovery through ML is
decelerated due to lack of generic tools to construct features and to build
models directly from the data. Hence, we developed a schema that calculates about
5,000 features, selects relevant features and develops protein classifiers from
the training data. To demonstrate the general applicability and robustness of our
method, fungal adhesins and nuclear receptor proteins were used for building
classifiers which outperformed existing classifiers when tested on independent
data. Next, we built a classifier for mitochondrial proteins of Plasmodium
falciparum which causes human malaria because the latest corresponding
classifiers are not publically accessible. Our classifier attained 98.18 %
accuracy and 0.95 Matthews correlation coefficient by fivefold cross-validation
and outperformed existing classifiers on independent test set. We implemented
this schema as user-friendly and open source application Pro-Gyan (
http://code.google.com/p/pro-gyan/ ), to build and share executable classifiers
without programming knowledge.

ApicoAMP: the first computational model for identifying apicoplast-targeted
transmembrane proteins in Apicomplexa.

University, Pullman, WA 99164, USA.

BACKGROUND: Computational identification of apicoplast-targeted proteins is
important in drug target determination for diseases such as malaria. While there 
are established methods for identifying proteins with a bipartite signal in
multiple species of Apicomplexa, not all apicoplast-targeted proteins possess
this bipartite signature. The publication of recent experimental findings of
apicoplast membrane proteins, called transmembrane proteins, that do not possess 
a bipartite signal has made it feasible to devise a machine learning approach for
identifying this new class of apicoplast-targeted proteins computationally.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this work, we develop a method for predicting 
apicoplast-targeted transmembrane proteins for multiple species of Apicomplexa,
whereby several classifiers trained on different feature sets and based on
different algorithms are evaluated and combined in an ensemble classification
model to obtain the best expected performance. The feature sets considered are
the hydrophobicity and composition characteristics of amino acids over
transmembrane domains, the existence of short sequence motifs over cytosolically 
disposed regions, and Gene Ontology (GO) terms associated with given proteins.
Our model, ApicoAMP, is an ensemble classification model that combines decisions 
of classifiers following the majority vote principle. ApicoAMP is trained on a
set of proteins from 11 apicomplexan species and achieves 91% overall expected
accuracy.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: ApicoAMP is the first computational model capable of
identifying apicoplast-targeted transmembrane proteins in Apicomplexa. The
ApicoAMP prediction software is available at http://code.google.com/p/apicoamp/
and http://bcb.eecs.wsu.edu.

Resistance to drugs that treat infectious disease is a major problem worldwide.
The rapid emergence of drug resistance is not well understood. We present two in 
silico models for the discovery of drug resistance mechanisms and for combating
the evolution of resistance, respectively. In the first model, we computationally
investigated subgraphs of a biological interaction network that show substantial 
adaptations when cells transcriptionally respond to a changing environment or
treatment. As a case study, we investigated the response of the malaria parasite 
Plasmodium falciparum to chloroquine and tetracycline treatments. The second
model involves a machine learning technique that combines clustering, common
distance similarity measurements, and hierarchical clustering to propose new
combinations of drug targets.

BACKGROUND: Malaria is a major healthcare problem worldwide resulting in an
estimated 0.65 million deaths every year. It is caused by the members of the
parasite genus Plasmodium. The current therapeutic options for malaria are
limited to a few classes of molecules, and are fast shrinking due to the
emergence of widespread resistance to drugs in the pathogen. The recent
availability of high-throughput phenotypic screen datasets for antimalarial
activity offers a possibility to create computational models for bioactivity
based on chemical descriptors of molecules with potential to accelerate drug
discovery for malaria.
RESULTS: In the present study, we have used high-throughput screen datasets for
the discovery of apicoplast inhibitors of the malarial pathogen as assayed from
the delayed death response. We employed machine learning approach and developed
computational predictive models to predict the biological activity of new
antimalarial compounds. The molecules were further evaluated for common
substructures using a Maximum Common Substructure (MCS) based approach.
CONCLUSIONS: We created computational models using state-of-the-art machine
learning algorithms. The models were evaluated based on multiple statistical
criteria. We found Random Forest based approach provides for better accuracy as
assessed from ROC curve analysis. We further evaluated the active molecules using
a substructure based approach to identify common substructures enriched in the
active set. We argue that the computational models generated could be effectively
used to screen large molecular datasets to prioritize them for phenotypic
screens, drastically reducing cost while improving the hit rate.

Machine learning approach for automated screening of malaria parasite using light
microscopic images.

Author information: 
(1)School of Medical Science and Technology, IIT Kharagpur, India.

The aim of this paper is to address the development of computer assisted malaria 
parasite characterization and classification using machine learning approach
based on light microscopic images of peripheral blood smears. In doing this,
microscopic image acquisition from stained slides, illumination correction and
noise reduction, erythrocyte segmentation, feature extraction, feature selection 
and finally classification of different stages of malaria (Plasmodium vivax and
Plasmodium falciparum) have been investigated. The erythrocytes are segmented
using marker controlled watershed transformation and subsequently total ninety
six features describing shape-size and texture of erythrocytes are extracted in
respect to the parasitemia infected versus non-infected cells. Ninety four
features are found to be statistically significant in discriminating six classes.
Here a feature selection-cum-classification scheme has been devised by combining 
F-statistic, statistical learning techniques i.e., Bayesian learning and support 
vector machine (SVM) in order to provide the higher classification accuracy using
best set of discriminating features. Results show that Bayesian approach provides
the highest accuracy i.e., 84% for malaria classification by selecting 19 most
significant features while SVM provides highest accuracy i.e., 83.5% with 9 most 
significant features. Finally, the performance of these two classifiers under
feature selection framework has been compared toward malaria parasite
classification.

University, Montreal, Canada.

OBJECTIVES: There is a growing body of literature on malaria forecasting methods 
and the objective of our review is to identify and assess methods, including
predictors, used to forecast malaria.
DESIGN: Scoping review. Two independent reviewers searched information sources,
assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data from each study.
INFORMATION SOURCES: Search strategies were developed and the following databases
were searched: CAB Abstracts, EMBASE, Global Health, MEDLINE, ProQuest
Dissertations & Theses and Web of Science. Key journals and websites were also
manually searched.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR INCLUDED STUDIES: We included studies that forecasted
incidence, prevalence or epidemics of malaria over time. A description of the
forecasting model and an assessment of the forecast accuracy of the model were
requirements for inclusion. Studies were restricted to human populations and to
autochthonous transmission settings.
RESULTS: We identified 29 different studies that met our inclusion criteria for
this review. The forecasting approaches included statistical modelling,
mathematical modelling and machine learning methods. Climate-related predictors
were used consistently in forecasting models, with the most common predictors
being rainfall, relative humidity, temperature and the normalised difference
vegetation index. Model evaluation was typically based on a reserved portion of
data and accuracy was measured in a variety of ways including mean-squared error 
and correlation coefficients. We could not compare the forecast accuracy of
models from the different studies as the evaluation measures differed across the 
studies.
CONCLUSIONS: Applying different forecasting methods to the same data, exploring
the predictive ability of non-environmental variables, including transmission
reducing interventions and using common forecast accuracy measures will allow
malaria researchers to compare and improve models and methods, which should
improve the quality of malaria forecasting.

Protease-associated cellular networks in malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum.

BACKGROUND: Malaria continues to be one of the most severe global infectious
diseases, responsible for 1-2 million deaths yearly. The rapid evolution and
spread of drug resistance in parasites has led to an urgent need for the
development of novel antimalarial targets. Proteases are a group of enzymes that 
play essential roles in parasite growth and invasion. The possibility of
designing specific inhibitors for proteases makes them promising drug targets.
Previously, combining a comparative genomics approach and a machine learning
approach, we identified the complement of proteases (degradome) in the malaria
parasite Plasmodium falciparum and its sibling species 123, providing a catalog
of targets for functional characterization and rational inhibitor design. Network
analysis represents another route to revealing the role of proteins in the
biology of parasites and we use this approach here to expand our understanding of
the systems involving the proteases of P. falciparum.
RESULTS: We investigated the roles of proteases in the parasite life cycle by
constructing a network using protein-protein association data from the STRING
database 4, and analyzing these data, in conjunction with the data from
protein-protein interaction assays using the yeast 2-hybrid (Y2H) system 5, blood
stage microarray experiments 678, proteomics 9101112, literature text mining, and
sequence homology analysis. Seventy-seven (77) out of 124 predicted proteases
were associated with at least one other protein, constituting 2,431
protein-protein interactions (PPIs). These proteases appear to play diverse roles
in metabolism, cell cycle regulation, invasion and infection. Their degrees of
connectivity (i.e., connections to other proteins), range from one to 143. The
largest protease-associated sub-network is the ubiquitin-proteasome system which 
is crucial for protein recycling and stress response. Proteases are also
implicated in heat shock response, signal peptide processing, cell cycle
progression, transcriptional regulation, and signal transduction networks.
CONCLUSIONS: Our network analysis of proteases from P. falciparum uses a
so-called guilt-by-association approach to extract sets of proteins from the
proteome that are candidates for further study. Novel protease targets and
previously unrecognized members of the protease-associated sub-systems provide
new insights into the mechanisms underlying parasitism, pathogenesis and
virulence.

To obtain candidates of interactions between proteins of the malaria parasite
Plasmodium falciparum and the human host, homologous and conserved interactions
were inferred from various sources of interaction data. Such candidate
interactions were assessed by applying a machine learning approach and further
filtered according to expression and molecular characteristics, enabling involved
proteins to indeed interact. The analysis of predicted interactions indicated
that parasite proteins predominantly target central proteins to take control of a
human host cell. Furthermore, parasite proteins utilized their protein repertoire
in a combinatorial manner, providing a broad connection to host cellular
processes. In particular, several prominent pathways of signaling and regulation 
proteins were predicted to interact with parasite chaperones. Such a result
suggests an important role of remodeling proteins in the interaction interface
between the human host and the parasite. Identification of such molecular
strategies that allow the parasite to take control of the host has the potential 
to deepen our understanding of the parasite specific remodeling processes of the 
host cell and illuminate new avenues of disease intervention.

Complex, high-dimensional data sets pose significant analytical challenges in the
post-genomic era. Such data sets are not exclusive to genetic analyses and are
also pertinent to epidemiology. There has been considerable effort to develop
hypothesis-free data mining and machine learning methodologies. However, current 
methodologies lack exhaustivity and general applicability. Here we use a novel
non-parametric, non-euclidean data mining tool, HyperCube®, to explore
exhaustively a complex epidemiological malaria data set by searching for over
density of events in m-dimensional space. Hotspots of over density correspond to 
strings of variables, rules, that determine, in this case, the occurrence of
Plasmodium falciparum clinical malaria episodes. The data set contained 46,837
outcome events from 1,653 individuals and 34 explanatory variables. The best
predictive rule contained 1,689 events from 148 individuals and was defined as:
individuals present during 1992-2003, aged 1-5 years old, having hemoglobin AA,
and having had previous Plasmodium malariae malaria parasite infection ≤10 times.
These individuals had 3.71 times more P. falciparum clinical malaria episodes
than the general population. We validated the rule in two different cohorts. We
compared and contrasted the HyperCube® rule with the rules using variables
identified by both traditional statistical methods and non-parametric regression 
tree methods. In addition, we tried all possible sub-stratified quantitative
variables. No other model with equal or greater representativity gave a higher
Relative Risk. Although three of the four variables in the rule were intuitive,
the effect of number of P. malariae episodes was not. HyperCube® efficiently
sub-stratified quantitative variables to optimize the rule and was able to
identify interactions among the variables, tasks not easy to perform using
standard data mining methods. Search of local over density in m-dimensional
space, explained by easily interpretable rules, is thus seemingly ideal for
generating hypotheses for large datasets to unravel the complexity inherent in
biological systems.

Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel.

MOTIVATION: Large-scale RNA expression measurements are generating enormous
quantities of data. During the last two decades, many methods were developed for 
extracting insights regarding the interrelationships between genes from such
data. The mathematical and computational perspectives that underlie these methods
are usually algebraic or probabilistic.
RESULTS: Here, we introduce an unexplored geometric view point where expression
levels of genes in multiple experiments are interpreted as vectors in a
high-dimensional space. Specifically, we find, for the expression profile of each
particular gene, its approximation as a linear combination of profiles of a few
other genes. This method is inspired by recent developments in the realm of
compressed sensing in the machine learning domain. To demonstrate the power of
our approach in extracting valuable information from the expression data, we
independently applied it to large-scale experiments carried out on the yeast and 
malaria parasite whole transcriptomes. The parameters extracted from the sparse
reconstruction of the expression profiles, when fed to a supervised learning
platform, were used to successfully predict the relationships between genes
throughout the Gene Ontology hierarchy and protein-protein interaction map.
Extensive assessment of the biological results shows high accuracy in both
recovering known predictions and in yielding accurate predictions missing from
the current databases. We suggest that the geometrical approach presented here is
suitable for a broad range of high-dimensional experimental data.

Critical to the mitigation of parasitic vector-borne diseases is the development 
of accurate spatial predictions that integrate environmental conditions conducive
to pathogen proliferation. Species of Plasmodium and Trypanosoma readily infect
humans, and are also common in birds. Here, we develop predictive spatial models 
for the prevalence of these blood parasites in the olive sunbird (Cyanomitra
olivacea). Since this species exhibits high natural parasite prevalence and
occupies diverse habitats in tropical Africa, it represents a distinctive
ecological model system for studying vector-borne pathogens. We used PCR and
microscopy to screen for haematozoa from 28 sites in Central and West Africa.
Species distribution models were constructed to associate ground-based and
remotely sensed environmental variables with parasite presence. We then used
machine-learning algorithm models to identify relationships between parasite
prevalence and environmental predictors. Finally, predictive maps were generated 
by projecting model outputs to geographically unsampled areas. Results indicate
that for Plasmodium spp., the maximum temperature of the warmest month was most
important in predicting prevalence. For Trypanosoma spp., seasonal canopy
moisture variability was the most important predictor. The models presented here 
visualize gradients of disease prevalence, identify pathogen hotspots and will be
instrumental in studying the effects of ecological change on these and other
pathogens.

The rate of human death due to malaria is increasing day-by-day. Thus the malaria
causing parasite Plasmodium falciparum (PF) remains the cause of concern. With
the wealth of data now available, it is imperative to understand protein
localization in order to gain deeper insight into their functional roles. In this
manuscript, an attempt has been made to develop prediction method for the
localization of mitochondrial proteins. In this study, we describe a method for
predicting mitochondrial proteins of malaria parasite using machine-learning
technique. All models were trained and tested on 175 proteins (40 mitochondrial
and 135 non-mitochondrial proteins) and evaluated using five-fold cross
validation. We developed a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for predicting
mitochondrial proteins of P. falciparum, using amino acids and dipeptides
composition and achieved maximum MCC 0.38 and 0.51, respectively. In this study, 
split amino acid composition (SAAC) is used where composition of N-termini,
C-termini, and rest of protein is computed separately. The performance of SVM
model improved significantly from MCC 0.38 to 0.73 when SAAC instead of simple
amino acid composition was used as input. In addition, SVM model has been
developed using composition of PSSM profile with MCC 0.75 and accuracy 91.38%. We
achieved maximum MCC 0.81 with accuracy 92% using a hybrid model, which combines 
PSSM profile and SAAC. When evaluated on an independent dataset our method
performs better than existing methods. A web server PFMpred has been developed
for predicting mitochondrial proteins of malaria parasites (

The spread of drug resistance through malaria parasite populations calls for the 
development of new therapeutic strategies. However, the seemingly promising
genomics-driven target identification paradigm is hampered by the weak annotation
coverage. To identify potentially important yet uncharacterized proteins, we
apply support vector machines using profile kernels, a supervised discriminative 
machine learning technique for remote homology detection, as a complement to the 
traditional alignment based algorithms. In this study, we focus on the prediction
of proteases, which have long been considered attractive drug targets because of 
their indispensable roles in parasite development and infection. Our analysis
demonstrates that an abundant and complex repertoire is conserved in five
Plasmodium parasite species. Several putative proteases may be important
components in networks that mediate cellular processes, including hemoglobin
digestion, invasion, trafficking, cell cycle fate, and signal transduction. This 
catalog of proteases provides a short list of targets for functional
characterization and rational inhibitor design.

BACKGROUND: Malaria parasite secretes various proteins in infected RBC for its
growth and survival. Thus identification of these secretory proteins is important
for developing vaccine/drug against malaria. The existing motif-based methods
have got limited success due to lack of universal motif in all secretory proteins
of malaria parasite.
RESULTS: In this study a systematic attempt has been made to develop a general
method for predicting secretory proteins of malaria parasite. All models were
trained and tested on a non-redundant dataset of 252 secretory and 252
non-secretory proteins. We developed SVM models and achieved maximum MCC 0.72
with 85.65% accuracy and MCC 0.74 with 86.45% accuracy using amino acid and
dipeptide composition respectively. SVM models were developed using split-amino
acid and split-dipeptide composition and achieved maximum MCC 0.74 with 86.40%
accuracy and MCC 0.77 with accuracy 88.22% respectively. In this study, for the
first time PSSM profiles obtained from PSI-BLAST, have been used for predicting
secretory proteins. We achieved maximum MCC 0.86 with 92.66% accuracy using PSSM 
based SVM model. All models developed in this study were evaluated using 5-fold
cross-validation technique.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that secretory proteins have different
residue composition than non-secretory proteins. Thus, it is possible to predict 
secretory proteins from its residue composition-using machine learning technique.
The multiple sequence alignment provides more information than sequence itself.
Thus performance of method based on PSSM profile is more accurate than method
based on sequence composition. A web server PSEApred has been developed for
predicting secretory proteins of malaria parasites,the URL can be found in the
Availability and requirements section.
